          "Heat loss quantification (HLQ) is an essential step in improving a building's thermal performance and optimizing its energy usage. While this problem is well-studied in the literature, most of the existing studies are either qualitative or minimally driven quantitative studies that rely on localized building envelope points and are, thus, not suitable for automated solutions in energy audit applications. This research work is an attempt to fill this gap of knowledge by utilizing intensive thermal data (on the order of 100,000 plus images) and constitutes a relatively new area of analysis in energy audit applications. Specifically, we demonstrate a novel process using deep-learning methods to segment more than 100,000 thermal images collected from an unmanned aerial system (UAS). To quantify the heat loss for a building envelope, multiple stages of computations need to be performed: object detection (using Mask-RCNN/Faster R-CNN), estimating the surface temperature (using two clustering methods), and finally calculating the overall heat transfer coefficient (e.g., the U-value). The proposed model was applied to eleven academic campuses across the state of North Dakota. The preliminary findings indicate that Mask R-CNN outperformed other instance segmentation models with an mIOU of 73% for facades, 55% for windows, 67% for roofs, 24% for doors, and 11% for HVACs. Two clustering methods, namely K-means and threshold-based clustering (TBC), were deployed to estimate surface temperatures with TBC providing consistent estimates across all times of the day over K-means. Our analysis demonstrated that thermal efficiency not only depended on the accurate acquisition of thermal images but also relied on other factors, such as the building geometry and seasonal weather parameters, such as the outside/inside building temperatures, wind, time of day, and indoor heating/cooling conditions. Finally, the resultant U-values of various building envelopes were compared with recommendations from the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) building standards.",
          "Deep Learning methods have important applications in the building construction image classification field. One challenge of this application is Convolutional Neural Networks adoption in a small datasets. This paper proposes a rigorous methodology for tuning of Data Augmentation hyperparameters in Deep Learning to building construction image classification, especially to vegetation recognition in facades and roofs structure analysis. In order to do that, Logistic Regression models were used to analyze the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks trained from 128 combinations of transformations in the images. Experiments were carried out with three architectures of Deep Learning from the literature using the Keras library. The results show that the recommended configuration (Height Shift Range = 0.2; Width Shift Range = 0.2; Zoom Range =0.2) reached an accuracy of 95.6% in the test step of first case study. In addition, the hyperparameters recommended by proposed method also achieved the best test results for second case study: 93.3%.",
          "Building facade colors play an important role in influencing urban imageability, attraction and citizens' experience. However, the relations between street functions and the building facade color distribution, color harmony and color diversity have not been thoroughly examined. We obtained the dominant colors of building facades in Changning District, Shanghai, utilizing Baidu street view images, image semantic segmentation technology and the K-means algorithm. The variations in building facades' dominant colors, color harmony and diversity across different types of functional streets were examined through logistic regression and ANOVA analyses. The results indicate that, compared to industrial streets, red hues are more common in science education streets, residential streets and mixed functional streets. Business streets are more likely to have hues of green, red and red-purple. Residential streets' saturation is overall higher than that of industrial streets. In business streets, the medium-high value occurs less frequently than other streets. Moreover, we found that the street building facade colors in industrial streets were more harmonious and less diversified than that in other functional streets. This study has implications for urban color planning practices. Color harmony and color diversity should be well considered in future planning. The role of street functions should also be addressed in building facade color planning, to improve existing planning frameworks as well as related strategies.",
          "Building performance significantly influences energy use and indoor thermal conditions tied to the quality of living for its occupants. Therefore, information on building envelopes is essential, especially considering that envelopes and windows can impact 50% of energy loads in the United States. However, current retrofits supporting Building Energy Modelling (BEM) tools face multiple barriers, including time consumption and labor intensity due to manual modeling and calibration processes. This paper proposes using Deep Learning (DL) -based object detection algorithms to detect building envelope components, more specificlly doors, and windows, that can be applied to building energy performance analysis, 3D modeling, and assessment of thermal irregularities. We compare four different versions of the state-of-the-art YOLO V5 model to identify which version best suits the goal of detecting these building components. Results show that YOLO V5_X provides the best performance for detection accuracy.",
          "Urban environments are regions of complex and diverse architecture. Their reconstruction and representation as three-dimensional city models have attracted the attention of many researchers and industry specialists, as they increasingly recognise the potential for new applications requiring detailed building models. Nevertheless, despite being investigated for a few decades, the comprehensive reconstruction of buildings remains a challenging task. While there is a considerable body of literature on this topic, including several systematic reviews summarising ways of acquiring and reconstructing coarse building structures, there is a paucity of in-depth research on the detection and reconstruction of facade openings (i.e., windows and doors). In this review, we provide an overview of emerging applications, data acquisition and processing techniques for building facade reconstruction, emphasising building opening detection. The use of traditional technologies from terrestrial and aerial platforms, along with emerging approaches, such as mobile phones and volunteered geography information, is discussed. The current status of approaches for opening detection is then examined in detail, separated into methods for three-dimensional and two-dimensional data. Based on the review, it is clear that a key limitation associated with facade reconstruction is process automation and the need for user intervention. Another limitation is the incompleteness of the data due to occlusion, which can be reduced by data fusion. In addition, the lack of available diverse benchmark datasets and further investigation into deep-learning methods for facade openings extraction present crucial opportunities for future research.",
          "Deep Learning methods have important applications in digital image processing. However, the literature lacks further studies that propose machine learning models to images classification in civil construction area. For example, the vegetation recognition on facades can be relevant in identifying the degradation and abandonment of buildings. Thus, the objective of this paper is to propose an Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) approach to vegetation images recognition in buildings. For this, a database with urban images (low altitude) captured by a drone in Zurich (Switzerland) was adopted. In addition, a rigorous hyperparameters tuning methodology for the CNN model is presented. After adjusting the hyperparameters and the final model, the system achieved 90% of accuracy in the test stage. It should also be noted that CNN correctly classified 97.8% of the positive class (with vegetation on the facade) in test images.",
          "This paper presents an automated as-is facade modeling method for existing and historic high-rise buildings, named Scan4Facade. To begin with, a camera drone with a spiral path is employed to capture building exterior images, and photogrammetry is used to conduct three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and create mesh models for the scanned building facades. High-resolution facade orthoimages are then generated from mesh models and pixelwise segmented by an artificial intelligence (AI) model named U-net. A combined data augmentation strategy, including random flipping, rotation, resizing, perspective transformation, and color adjustment, is proposed for model training with a limited number of labels. As a result, the U-net achieves an average pixel accuracy of 0.9696 and a mean intersection over union of 0.9063 in testing. Then, the developed twoStagesClustering algorithm, with a two-round shape clustering and a two-round coordinates clustering, is used to precisely extract facade elements' dimensions and coordinates from facade orthoimages and pixelwise label. In testing with the Michigan Central Station (office tower), a historic high-rise building, the developed algorithm achieves an accuracy of 99.77% in window extraction. In addition, the extracted facade geometric information and element types are transformed into AutoCAD command and script files to create CAD drawings without manual interaction. Experimental results also show that the proposed Scan4Facade method can provide clear and accurate information to assist BIM feature creation in Revit. Future research recommendations are also stated in this paper. ",
          "The extraction and integration of building facade data are necessary for the development of information infrastructure for urban environments. However, existing methods for parsing building facades based on semantic segmentation have difficulties in distinguishing individual instances of connected buildings. Manually collecting and annotating instances of building facades in large datasets is time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the recent development and use of city digital twins (CDTs), massive high-quality digital assets of buildings have been created. These assets make it possible to generate high-quality and cost-effective synthetic datasets that can replace real-world ones as training sets for the supervised learning-based instance segmentation of building facades. In this study, we developed a novel framework that can automatically produce synthetic datasets from a CDT. An auto-generation system for synthetic street views was built by rendering city digital assets in a game engine, while the system auto-generated the instance annotations for building facades. The hybrid dataset HSRBFIA, along with various subsets containing different proportions of synthetic and real data, were used to train deep learning models for facade instance segmentation. In our experiments, two types of synthetic data (CDT-based and virtual-based) were compared, and the results showed that the CDT synthetic data were more effective in boosting deep learning training with real-world images compared with the virtual synthetic data (no real-world counterparts). By swapping a certain portion of the real data with the proposed CDT synthetic images, the performance could almost match what is achievable when using the real-world training set.",
          "Deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks have largely improved the performance of building segmentation from remote sensing images. However, the images for building segmentation are often in the form of traditional orthophotos, where the relief displacement would cause non-negligible misalignment between the roof outline and the footprint of a building; such misalignment poses considerable challenges for extracting accurate building footprints, especially for high-rise buildings. Aiming at alleviating this problem, a new workflow is proposed for generating rectified building footprints from traditional orthophotos. We first use the facade labels, which are prepared efficiently at low cost, along with the roof labels to train a semantic segmentation network. Then, the well-trained network, which employs the state-of-the-art version of EfficientNet as backbone, extracts the roof segments and the facade segments of buildings from the input image. Finally, after clustering the classified pixels into instance-level building objects and tracing out the roof outlines, an energy function is proposed to drive the roof outline to maximally align with the building footprint; thus, the rectified footprints can be generated. The experiments on the aerial orthophotos covering a high-density residential area in Shanghai demonstrate that the proposed workflow can generate obviously more accurate building footprints than the baseline methods, especially for high-rise buildings.",
          "Precise urban facade color is the foundation of urban color planning. Nevertheless, existing research on urban colors usually relies on manual sampling due to technical limitations, which brings challenges for evaluating urban facade color with the co-existence of city-scale and fine-grained resolution. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based approach for mapping the urban facade color using street-view imagery. The dominant color of the urban facade (DCUF) is adopted as an indicator to describe the urban facade color. A case study in Shenzhen was conducted to measure the urban facade color using Baidu Street View (BSV) panoramas, with city-scale mapping of the urban facade color in both irregular geographical units and regular grids. Shenzhen's urban facade color has a gray tone with low chroma. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has a high level of accuracy for the extraction of the urban facade color. In short, this study contributes to the development of urban color planning by efficiently analyzing the urban facade color with higher levels of validity across city-scale areas. Insights into the mapping of the urban facade color from the humanistic perspective could facilitate higher quality urban space planning and design.",
          "The objective of this paper is to propose an approach which combines the multi view 3D reconstruction process of a building's facade with semantic information obtained by a deep neural network on the 2D observations of the considered scene. The object detector was used to annotate precise 2D features with semantic labels based on the object proposals. In a next step, spatially connected 2D features were evaluated to extend the initially computed labels to the whole facade element. The set of annotated 2D precise features was used to derive a classification of reconstructed 3D features. The a priori probabilities of the object detection model were used to compensate for biased predictions. The described approach was evaluated thoroughly with a view to different strategies for the annotation correction in 2D. Several failure patterns occurring in the considered application of facade reconstruction were observed and suggested solutions were given.",
          "Automatic building categorization and analysis are particularly relevant for smart city applications and cultural heritage programs. Taking a picture of the facade of a building and instantly obtaining information about it can enable the automation of processes in urban planning, virtual city tours, and digital archiving of cultural artifacts. In this paper, we go beyond traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and propose the HierarchyNet: a new hierarchical network for the classification of urban buildings from all across the globe into different main and subcategories from images of their facades. We introduce a coarse-to-fine hierarchy on the dataset and the model learns to simultaneously extract features and classify across both levels of hierarchy. We propose a new multiplicative layer, which is able to improve the accuracy of the finer prediction by considering the feedback signal of the coarse layers. We have quantitatively evaluated the proposed approach both on our proposed building datasets, as well as on various benchmark databases to demonstrate that the model is able to efficiently learn hierarchical information. The HierarchyNet model is able to outperform the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks in urban building classification as well as in other multi-label classification tasks while using significantly fewer parameters.",
          "Three-dimensional (3D) city modeling is an essential component of 3D geoscience modeling, and window detection of building facades plays a crucial role in 3D city modeling. Windows can serve as structural priors for rapid building reconstruction. In this article, we propose a framework for detecting window lines. The framework consists of two parts: an improved stacked hourglass network and a point-line extraction module. This framework can output vectorized window wireframes from building facade images. Besides, our method is end-to-end trainable, and the vectorized window wireframe consists of point-line structures. The point-line structure contains both semantic and geometric information. Additionally, we propose a new dataset of real-world building facades for window-line detection. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method has superior efficiency, accuracy, and applicability in window-line detection compared to existing line detection algorithms. Moreover, our proposed method presents a new idea for deep learning methods in window detection and other application scenarios in current 3D geoscience modeling.",
          "Energy audit in buildings is an essential task for optimal energy management and operations. This paper focuses on a machine learning pipeline to quantify heat loss using 60,000 thermal images in buildings. The images are captured from a small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) over the last two years to form a large thermal data repository. Intense efforts are made to annotate multiple sections of the buildings (e.g. windows, doors, ground, facade, trees, and sky). Data augmentation processes are then applied to generate a large comprehensive training data set. Object detection and instance segmentation models such as Mask R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, and Faster R-CNN were trained, and tested. The preliminary results indicate that Mask R-CNN has a larger mean average precision (mAP) of (83%) over R-CNN (51%), Fast R-CNN (62%), and Faster R-CNN (62 %) for a threshold of 50%. The surface temperature values from these thermal images (pixel-by-pixel) were then used in the standard heat transfer coefficient (U-value in BTU/hr/Sq.ft./F) calculations.",
          "Measuring window to wall ratios (WWRs) is key to assessing building performance as facade apertures control the admission of light, wind and heat. However, this data is not always publicly available. This paper details a methodology for automatically extracting and rectifying street-view facade imagery while utilizing a Machine Learning model to detect WWRs with architectural generalization in mind. Although several models of detection have emerged to categorize facade features, some lack robustness when presented with greater design diversity. Hence, the training and validation process of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model utilized is centered around three main data categories; environmental conditions, design diversity and context. The results show that the proposed workflow sufficiently represents the WWRs of buildings in an area in Lisbon under varied design conditions. We find that the distribution of prediction accuracy, tested on 864 facades, shows that 72% of buildings are detected within the 10% error range.",
          "With buildings consuming nearly 40% of energy in developed countries, it is important to accurately estimate and understand the building energy efficiency in a city. A better understanding of building energy efficiency is beneficial for reducing overall household energy use and providing guidance for future housing improvement and retrofit. In this research, we propose a deep learning-based multi-source data fusion framework to estimate building energy efficiency. We consider the traditional factors associated with the building energy efficiency from the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for 160,000 properties (30,000 buildings) in Glasgow, UK (e.g., property structural attributes and morphological attributes), as well as the Google Street View (GSV) building facade images as a complement. We compare the performance improvements between our data-fusion framework with traditional morphological attributes and image-only models. The results show that including the building facade images from GSV, the overall model accuracy increases from 79.7% to 86.8%. A further investigation and explanation of the deep learning model are conducted to understand the relationships between building features and building energy efficiency by using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Our research demonstrates the potential of using multi-source data in building energy efficiency prediction with high accuracy and short inference time. Our paper also helps understand building energy efficiency at the city level to help achieve the netzero target by 2050.",
          "Precise measuring of urban facade color is necessary for urban color planning. The existing manual methods of measuring building facade color are limited by time and labor costs and hardly carried out on a city scale. These methods also make it challenging to identify the role of the building function in controlling and guiding urban color planning. This paper explores a city-scale approach to facade color measurement with building functional classification using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and street view images. Firstly, we used semantic segmentation to extract building facades and conducted the color calibration of the photos for pre-processing the collected street view images. Then, we proposed a color chart-based facade color measurement method and a multi-label deep learning-based building classification method. Next, the field survey data were used as the ground truth to verify the accuracy of the facade color measurement and building function classification. Finally, we applied our approach to generate facade color distribution maps with the building classification for three metropolises in China, and the results proved the transferability and effectiveness of the scheme. The proposed approach can provide city managers with an overall perception of urban facade color and building function across city-scale areas in a cost-efficient way, contributing to data-driven decision making for urban analytics and planning.",
          "Buildings account for 40% of the energy consumption and more than 50% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide. Various building energy efficiency policies have been issued in many cities around the US, requiring the disclosure of buildings' energy performance and encourage building owners to take this information into consideration for retrofit investment decisions. However, various types of building information at different scales are meant to be collected and disclosed with costs that have substantial variations accordingly. Hence, complying with these policies is expensive and time-consuming for both government agencies and building owners. This paper proposes a non-intrusive and scalable data-driven approach to automatically capture energy-critical building characteristics to declare energy benchmarking or retrofitting policies. This approach first integrated open city data sets (building-related) and identified principal building variables in relation to energy performance indexes (i.e., electricity usage), then utilized transfer learning to retrain deep learning models on building facade images (retrieved from Google Street View) to extract their corresponding principal building variables. To elaborate, given a fully captured facade image of any building, this approach provides the data values for the identified principal variables (e.g., for a facade image given as an input, the outputs will include buildingType = Office). The best accuracy of the extraction model exceeds 80% in extracting building types from images, which indicates that the model is capable of extracting data values for the principal building variables that are essential for energy performance of buildings.",
          "Thermography technology is widely used to inspect thermal anomalies in building facade systems. Computer vision-based techniques provide opportunities to autonomously detect such heat anomalies to significantly improve the efficiency of decision-making for building envelope retrofitting and maintenance. In this work, we propose a novel Capsule Network-based deep learning model - CapsLab - that detects and identifies thermal anomalies by semantic segmentation. CapsLab is built based on our proposed prediction-tuning capsule (PT-Capsule) layer. Different from a traditional capsule layer, which consists of part-whole transformation and capsule-routing process, the proposed layer is composed of a prediction and tuning process, which helps decreasing the number of model parameters significantly. While the applicability of traditional Capsule Networks (CapsNets) has been limited to simpler tasks and smaller datasets due to their scalability issue, we can leverage the lightweight of the proposed PT-Capsule layer, and apply it to the semantic segmentation task. In this work, we also employ our previously presented performance metric, referred to as the Anomaly Identification Metric (AIM) (Kakillioglua et al. 2021), to evaluate the segmentation outputs. Traditional performance metrics do not accurately reflect the true performance of the segmentation models in thermal anomaly identification due to the high subjectivity in the annotation process and higher overlap ratio sensitivity of the standard metrics. AIM, on the other hand, is robust to these drawbacks. Experimental results show, both qualitatively and quantitatively, that our proposed segmentation method can effectively segment the thermal anomalies. Specifically, our model provides 9.38% and 13.53% improvements over the baseline model - DeepLabV3+ - based on traditional mIoU score and the AIM score, respectively, while requiring less model parameters and less computation at the same time. In addition, the scores that the AIM metric generates better align with the scores provided by building performance experts.",
          "Systems that rely on Face Recognition (FR) biometric have gained great importance ever since terrorist threats imposed weakness among the implemented security systems. Other biometrics i.e., fingerprints or iris recognition is not trustworthy in such situations whereas FR is considered as a fine compromise. This survey illustrates different FR practices that laid foundations on the issue of partial occlusion dilemma where faces are disguised to cheat the security system. Occlusion refers to facade of the face image which can be due to sunglasses, hair or wrapping of facial image by scarf or other accessories. Efforts on FR in controlled settings have been in the picture for past several years; however identification under uncontrolled conditions like illumination, expression and partial occlusion is quite a matter of concern. Based on literature a classification is made in this paper to solve the recognition of face in the presence of partial occlusion. These methods are named as part based methods that make use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Local Non-negative Matrix Factorization (LNMF), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and other variations. Feature based and fractal based methods consider features around eyes, nose or mouth region to be used in the recognition phase of algorithms. Furthermore the paper details the experiments and databases used by an assortment of authors to handle the problem of occlusion and the results obtained after performing diverse set of analysis. Lastly, a comparison of various techniques is shown in tabular format to give a precise overview of what different authors have already projected in this particular field.",
          "3D city models are often generated from oblique aerial images and photogrammetric point clouds. In contrast to roof surfaces, facades can not directly be reconstructed in a similar high level of quality from this data. Distortions of perspective might appear in images, due to the camera angle. Occlusions and shadowing occur as well. Objects, such as windows and doors, will have to be detected on such data if facades are to be reconstructed. Although one can use inpainting techniques to cover occluded areas, detection results are often incomplete and noisy. Formal grammars can then be used to align and add objects. However, it is difficult to find suitable rules for all types of buildings. We propose a post-processing approach based on neural networks to improve facade layouts. To this end, we applied existing Recurrent Neural Network architectures like Multi-Dimensional Long Short-term Memory Network and Quasi Recurrent Neural Network in a new context. We also propose a novel architecture, the Rotated Multi-Dimensional Long Short Term Memory. In order to deal with two-dimensional neighborhoods this architecture combines four two-dimensional Multi-Dimensional Long Short-term Memory Networks on rotated images. We could improve the quality of detection results on the Graz50 data set.",
          "Building color and harmoniousness have been regarded as critical issues in planning historic districts. Harmoniousness of building facade colors (HBFC) is an indicator to evaluate the quality of the built environment, which can be perceived but is difficult to measure quantitatively. In addition, alleviating the impact of shadows in street-view images (SVIs) to assess building facade color is another research gap that is difficult to address. This paper proposes an efficient approach for evaluating HBFC on a large-scale using SVIs and a deep learning algorithm. Specifically, a shadow processing method was developed, and transfer learning was integrated into the harmoniousness evaluation process. The historical district of Guangzhou, China, was selected as a case study area. This study contributes to the development of human-centered planning and design by providing continuous measurements of unmeasurable quality across large-scale areas. Meanwhile, insights into building facade color and its harmoniousness can assist with accurate design guidance, which is important for historic districts.",

          "3D buildings in LoD3 (with facade objects) with semantic information are of great importance for many applications. In this paper, an interactive approach is proposed for 3D building models in LoD3 by using VGI image data. Similar to JSOM, an interactive platform is developed to acquire a facade model with detailed geometries and semantics. Techniques of feature extraction are incorporated in the software, so that a facade can be modeled by only sketching the boundary of the facade and one or two facade objects from one VGI image. The feedbacks of the current Beta version depict that the software is user friendly and can generate 3D facade while labelling facade objects by very few interactive input.",
          "Color information is a useful attribute to include in a building's description to assist the listener in identifying the intended target. Often this information is only available as image data, and not readily accessible for use in constructing referring expressions for verbal communication. The method presented uses a GIS building polygon layer in conjunction with street-level captured imagery to provide a method to automatically filter foreground objects and select pixels which correspond to building facades. These selected pixels are then used to define the most appropriate color term for the building, and corresponding fuzzy color term histogram. The technique uses a single camera capturing images at a high frame rate, with the baseline distance between frames calculated from a GPS speed log. The expected distance from the camera to the building is measured from the polygon layer and refined from the calculated depth map, after which building pixels are selected. In addition significant foreground planar surfaces between the known road edge and building facade are identified as possible boundary walls and hedges. The output is a dataset of the most appropriate color terms for both the building and boundary walls. Initial trials demonstrate the usefulness of the technique in automatically capturing color terms for buildings in urban regions.",
          "Developments in the field of artificial intelligence have made great strides in the field of automatic semantic segmentation, both in the 2D (image) and 3D spaces. Within the context of 3D recording technology it has also seen application in several areas, most notably in creating semantically rich point clouds which is usually performed manually. In this paper, we propose the introduction of deep learning-based semantic image segmentation into the photogrammetric 3D reconstruction and classification workflow. The main objective is to be able to introduce semantic classification at the beginning of the classical photogrammetric workflow in order to automatically create classified dense point clouds by the end of the said workflow. In this regard, automatic image masking depending on pre-determined classes were performed using a previously trained neural network. The image masks were then employed during dense image matching in order to constraint the process into the respective classes, thus automatically creating semantically classified point clouds as the final output. Results show that the developed method is promising, with automation of the whole process feasible from input (images) to output (labelled point clouds). Quantitative assessment gave good results for specific classes e.g., building facades and windows, with IoU scores of 0.79 and 0.77 respectively.",
          "We describe a real-time facade tracking system that uses, as setup information, only two images of a facade, captured on the moment. No more previous information is needed, such as a facade 3D model, dimensions or aspect ratio. Feature points and their local descriptors are extracted from that pair of images and used during the detection and tracking of the facade. Additionally, parallax and topological information is also used in order to increase the overall robustness of the tracking process. Experiments show that the system can detect and track a wide variety of facades, including those that are not entirely planar, partially occluded or have few distinguishable visual landmarks. The reliance on on-the-spot information, alone, makes this system useful for Outdoor Augmented Reality applications, in an Anywhere Augmentation urban context.",
          "The lack of data on existing buildings hinders efforts towards repair, reuse, and recycling of materials, which are crucial for mitigating the climate crisis. Manual acquisition of building data is complex and timeconsuming, but combining street-level imagery with computer vision could significantly scale-up building materials documentation. We formulate the problem of building facade material detection as a multi-label classification task and present a method using GIS and street view imagery with just a few hundred annotated samples and a fine-tuned image classification model. Our method shows strong performance with macroaveraged F1 scores of 0.91 for Tokyo, 0.91 for NYC, 0.96 for Zurich, and 0.93 for the merged dataset. By utilizing open-access and non-proprietary data, our method can be scaled-up step by step to a global level. We make our in the wild dataset publicly available as the Urban Resource Cadastre Repository to encourage future work on automatic building material detection.",
          "With increasing urbanization, flooding is a major challenge for many cities today. Based on forecast precipitation, topography, and pipe networks, flood simulations can provide early warnings for areas and buildings at risk of flooding. Basement windows, doors, and underground garage entrances are common places where floodwater can flow into a building. Some buildings have been prepared or designed considering the threat of flooding, but others have not. Therefore, knowing the heights of these facade openings helps to identify places that are more susceptible to water ingress. However, such data is not yet readily available in most cities. Traditional surveying of the desired targets may be used, but this is a very time-consuming and laborious process. Instead, mobile mapping using LiDAR (light detection and ranging) is an efficient tool to obtain a large amount of high-density 3D measurement data. To use this method, it is required to extract the desired facade openings from the data in a fully automatic manner. This research presents a new process for the extraction of windows and doors from LiDAR mobile mapping data. Deep learning object detection models are trained to identify these objects. Usually, this requires to provide large amounts of manual annotations. In this paper, we mitigate this problem by leveraging a rule-based method. In a first step, the rule-based method is used to generate pseudo-labels. A semi-supervised learning strategy is then applied with three different levels of supervision. The results show that using only automatically generated pseudo-labels, the learning-based model outperforms the rule-based approach by 14.6% in terms of F1-score. After five hours of human supervision, it is possible to improve the model by another 6.2%. By comparing the detected facade openings' heights with the predicted water levels from a flood simulation model, a map can be produced which assigns per-building flood risk levels. Thus, our research provides a new geographic information layer for fine-grained urban emergency response. This information can be combined with flood forecasting to provide a more targeted disaster prevention guide for the city's infrastructure and residential buildings. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to achieve such a large scale, fine-grained building flood risk mapping.",
          "The acquisition of detailed information for buildings and their components becomes more and more important. However, an automatic reconstruction needs high-resolution measurements. Such features can be derived from images or 3D laserscans that are e.g. taken by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Since this data is not always available or not measurable at the first for example due to occlusions we developed a reasoning approach that is based on sparse observations. It benefits from an extensive prior knowledge of probability density distributions and functional dependencies and allows for the incorporation of further structural characteristics such as symmetries. Bayesian networks are used to determine posterior beliefs. Stochastic reasoning is complex since the problem is characterized by a mixture of discrete and continuous parameters that are in turn correlated by nonlinear constraints. To cope with this kind of complexity, the implemented reasoner combines statistical methods with constraint propagation. It generates a limited number of hypotheses in a model-based top-down approach. It predicts substructures in building facades - such as windows - that can be used for specific UAV navigations for further measurements.",
          "We propose a novel three-layered approach for semantic segmentation of building facades. In the first layer, starting from an oversegmentation of a facade, we employ the recently introduced machine learning technique Recursive Neural Networks (RNN) to obtain a probabilistic interpretation of each segment. In the second layer, initial labeling is augmented with the information coming from specialized facade component detectors. The information is merged using a Markov Random Field. In the third layer, we introduce weak architectural knowledge, which enforces the final reconstruction to be architecturally plausible and consistent. Rigorous tests performed on two existing datasets of building facades demonstrate that we significantly outperform the current-state of the art, even when using outputs from earlier layers of the pipeline. Also, we show how the final output of the third layer can be used to create a procedural reconstruction.",
          "Facade structural features can represent the overall framework of buildings. However, structural features extracted by the current methods contain a quantity of trivial unstructured information. In this study, we proposed an accurate extraction method for structural features of building facades through texture fusion. By performing texture fusion on building facade images, the interference of textural elements on structural feature extraction could be eliminated. After texture fusion, the line segment detector (LSD) algorithm is used to extract the structural features from the building facade images, and random sample consensus (RANSAC) is used to improve the continuity of structural features. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated by comparing results with the state-of-the-art methods, such as LSD, MLSD, CannyLines, and MCMLSD. Value setting of three important parameters is discussed in detail. The imagery facade features extracted through the proposed method provide valuable support for many fields, such as image feature registration and 3D reconstruction of building surfaces.",
          "This paper proposes a novel method for extracting facades structure from real-world pictures by using local geometric moment. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method has advantages of easy-to-implement, low computational cost, and robustness to noises, such as uneven illumination, shadow, and shade from other objects. Besides, our method is faster and has a lower space complexity, making it feasible for mobile devices and the situation where real-time data processing is required. Specifically, a facades structure modal is first proposed to support the use of our special noise reduction method, which is based on a self-adapt local threshold with Gaussian weighted average for image binarization processing and the feature of the facades structure. Next, we divide the picture of the building into many individual areas, each of which represents a door or a window in the picture. Subsequently we calculate the geometric moment and centroid for each individual area, for identifying those collinear ones based on the feature vectors, each of which is thereafter replaced with a line. Finally, we comprehensively analyze all the geometric moment and centroid to find out the facades structure of the building. We compare our result with other methods and especially report the result from the pictures taken in bad environmental conditions. Our system is designed for two application, i.e, the reconstruction of facades based on higher resolution ground-based on imagery, and the positional system based on recognize the urban building.",
          "Automatic semantic segmentation of images is becoming a very prominent research field with many promising and reliable solutions already available. Labelled images as input for the photogrammetric pipeline have enormous potential to improve the 3D reconstruction results. To support this argument, in this work we discuss the contribution of image semantic labelling towards image-based 3D reconstruction in photogrammetry. We experiment semantic information in various steps starting from feature matching to dense 3D reconstruction. Labelling in 2D is considered as an easier task in terms of data availability and algorithm maturity. However, since semantic labelling of all the images involved in the reconstruction may be a costly, laborious and time consuming task, we propose to use a deep learning architecture to automatically generate semantically segmented images. To this end, we have trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on historic building facade images that will be further enriched in the future. The first results of this study are promising, with an improved performance on the quality of the 3D reconstruction and the possibility to transfer the labelling results from 2D to 3D. [GRAPHICS] .",
          "Currently, data captured by Mobile Laser Scanners (MLS) is becoming a leading source for the modelling of building facade geometry. Automatic processing of MLS point clouds for feature extraction on building facades is a demanding work. Point cloud segmentation and recognition are the most important steps in this context. In this paper, a new approach for automatic and fast processing of MLS data for the detection of building patches while restricting to segment other features is introduced. After filtering of the point clouds, the building facade extraction takes place. An initial building point cluster detection and roughness based point separation within the cluster itself are the preliminary stages of this process. Thereafter points are segmented into planar patches based on the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) technique, as most facades are dominated by planar faces. An intelligent seed point selection method is introduced, and growing rules are applied in order to extract the most significant planar features which represent the building facades. Each segmented plane is afterwards processed to recognize the facade features. A rule based partitioning tree, constructed from the 2D geometric knowledge of building features is used for facade feature recognition. The approach has been tested with several urban data sets, and results demonstrate that the method can be applied in an efficient modelling process.",
          "Semantic layout-based image synthesizing, which has benefited from the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs), has received a substantial amount of attention recently. How to enhance the synthesis image equality while maintaining the stochasticity of the GAN remains a challenge. We propose a novel denoising framework to handle this problem. The generation of overlapping objects is another challenging task when synthesizing images from a semantic layout to a realistic RGB photograph. To overcome this deficiency, we include a one-hot semantic label map to force the generator to pay more attention to the generation of overlapping objects. Furthermore, we improve the loss function of the discriminator by considering the perturbed loss and cascade layer loss to guide the generation process. We applied our methods to the Cityscapes, photo-sketch, day-night, facades, and NYU datasets to demonstrate the image generation ability of our model.",
          "We address shape grammar parsing for facade segmentation using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Shape parsing entails simultaneously optimizing the geometry and the topology (e.g. number of floors) of the facade, so as to optimize the fit of the predicted shape with the responses of pixel-level 'terminal detectors'. We formulate this problem in terms of a Hierarchical Markov Decision Process, by employing a recursive binary split grammar. This allows us to use RL to efficiently find the optimal parse of a given facade in terms of our shape grammar. Building on the RL paradigm, we exploit state aggregation to speedup computation, and introduce image-driven exploration in RL to accelerate convergence. We achieve state-of-the-art results on facade parsing, with a significant speed-up compared to existing methods, and substantial robustness to initial conditions. We demonstrate that the method can also be applied to interactive segmentation, and to a broad variety of architectural styles.",
          "Scaffolds always act as disturbances when reconstructing the 3D scene of the construction site due to occlusions, similarities with buildings in color and height as well as their adjacent positions to wall surfaces. Since scaffolds are commonly utilized to assist the construction and maintenance of building structures, professionals can estimate the overall progress and temporal objects of construction projects by assessing the status or arrangement of the scaffolds. Its thin, repeating and complex structures also make it a valuable dataset for testing related algorithms and approaches for the reconstruction of 3D construction site scene. To this end, we present a data driven workflow for the detection and reconstruction of scaffolding components, including tubes, toeboards, and decks, given a photogrammetric point cloud. Our workflow consists of two parts: one part concerns the strategy based on projection and methods of grouping and slicing planar surfaces for detecting and extracting points of scaffolds from the construction site. The other part relates to the point feature derivation using a novel 3D local feature descriptor LSSHOT, designed for extracting features in the classification of points. Specifically, our workflow is implemented by five major steps, including preprocessing of the point cloud, division of building facades, classification of points, geometric modeling and refinement of results. To evaluate our proposed descriptor, a series of simulated experiments using synthetic datasets is conducted via shape matching tests. A real application is also carried out to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our workflow using the photogrammetric point cloud of a construction site. Results of simulated experiments reveal that our proposed descriptor outperforms the original SHOT descriptor in the simulated test, especially when dealing with point clouds having a large percentage of noise. Regarding the real application of reconstructing scaffolds, points of scaffolds are successfully detected, extracted, and reconstructed. For a facade having enough points, over 70% of the scaffolding elements are reconstructed. For the classification of points using LSSHOT descriptor and a random forest classifier, the accuracy of results for the points of two major scaffolding elements reaches more than 70% in our test examples.",
          "Point cloud classification plays an important role in a wide range of airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) applications, such as topographic mapping, forest monitoring, power line detection, and road detection. However, due to the sensor noise, high redundancy, incompleteness, and complexity of airborne LiDAR systems, point cloud classification is challenging. Traditional point cloud classification methods mostly focus on the development of handcrafted point geometry features and employ machine learning-based classification models to conduct point classification. In recent years, the advances of deep learning models have caused researchers to shift their focus towards machine learning-based models, specifically deep neural networks, to classify airborne LiDAR point clouds. These learning-based methods start by transforming the unstructured 3D point sets to regular 2D representations, such as collections of feature images, and then employ a 2D CNN for point classification. Moreover, these methods usually need to calculate additional local geometry features, such as planarity, sphericity and roughness, to make use of the local structural information in the original 3D space. Nonetheless, the 3D to 2D conversion results in information loss. In this paper, we propose a directionally constrained fully convolutional neural network (D-FCN) that can take the original 3D coordinates and LiDAR intensity as input; thus, it can directly apply to unstructured 3D point clouds for semantic labeling. Specifically, we first introduce a novel directionally constrained point convolution (D-Conv) module to extract locally representative features of 3D point sets from the projected 2D receptive fields. To make full use of the orientation information of neighborhood points, the proposed D-Conv module performs convolution in an orientation-aware manner by using a directionally constrained nearest neighborhood search. Then, we design a multiscale fully convolutional neural network with downsampling and upsampling blocks to enable multiscale point feature learning. The proposed D-FCN model can therefore process input point cloud with arbitrary sizes and directly predict the semantic labels for all the input points in an end-to-end manner. Without involving additional geometry features as input, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance on the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) 3D labeling benchmark dataset. The results show that our model achieves a new stateof-the-art performance on powerline, car, and facade categories. Moreover, to demonstrate the generalization abilities of the proposed method, we conduct further experiments on the 2019 Data Fusion Contest Dataset. Our proposed method achieves superior performance than the comparing methods and accomplishes an overall accuracy of 95.6% and an average F1 score of 0.810.",
          "Glass facade segmentation provides important semantic information for widespread application, such as light pollution assessment, energy conservation, emergency response, and so on. With the advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, aerial imagery is indispensable for urban environmental studies because it can quickly cover large-scale city areas that contain rich thematic information. However, various methods are elaborately designed for glass or transparent object detection in natural images but not for glass facades in oblique aerial images. In oblique aerial images, glass facade panels with salient boundaries are spatially related and have various sizes and appearances. For the glass facade segmentation task, we notice that semantic and instance segmentation methods have different strengths and failures. To get the best of both worlds, this letter presents an ensemble method to segment glass facades in oblique aerial images. A novel annotation strategy is adopted to preserve the spatial relationship between glass facade panels, and edge features are extracted to improve the detector's performance. Furthermore, we contribute a glass facade segmentation dataset (GFSD) to evaluate our method, which is a supplement to UAV image datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy effectively improves instance segmentation methods, and the ensemble method outperforms the single models with an F1 score of 95.48%.",
          "Effectively parsing the facade is essential to 3-D building reconstruction, which is a significant computer vision problem for digital entertainment. Although having achieved the promising results in semantic parsing, deep learning methods cannot directly make use of the architectural rules that play an important role in man-made structures. This article presents a novel translational symmetry-based approach. The unified facade parsing network integrates both segmentation and detection branches as the base parser. A translational symmetry measurement-based module is proposed to refine the initial results. After converting the facades into shape grammars, we employ an off-the-shelf rendering engine like Blender to reconstruct the high-quality 3-D models using procedural modeling. We conduct experiments on three public datasets, where our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",
          "In this paper we propose a geometry-based image retrieval scheme that makes use of projectively invariant features. Cross-ratio (CR) is an invariant feature under projective transformations for collinear points. We compute the CRs of point sets in quadruplets and the CR histogram is used as the feature for retrieval purposes. Being a geometric feature, it allows us to retrieve similar images irrespective of view point and illumination changes. We can retrieve the same building even if the facade has undergone a fresh coat of paints! Color and textural features can also be included, if desired. Experimental results show a favorably very good retrieval accuracy when tested on an image database of size 4000. The method is very effective in retrieving images having man-made objects rich in polygonal structures like buildings, rail tracks, etc. ",
          "Texture is one of the most important features for object detection and recognition. In many applications, it is derived from the responses of texture filters. In this paper, we evaluate the potential of seven texture filter banks for the pixel-based classification of terrestrial facade images. Particularly, we analyze features from Gabor, Haar, Root Filter Set, and Walsh filters as well as filters that have been proposed by Laws (1980), Leung and Malik (2001), and Schmid (2001). We determine texture energies similar to the approach of Laws (1980) using the proposed filter banks, and then we classify the derived feature vectors by three different methods: maximum a posteriori probabilities (MAP), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and random forest (RF), respectively. In all three cases, we obtained best classification results with Haar, Laws, and Walsh filters.",
          "A longstanding line of research in urban studies explores how cities can be understood through their appearance. However, what remains unclear is to what extent urban dwellers' everyday life can be explained by the visual clues of the urban environment. In this paper, we address this question by applying a computer vision model to 27 million street view images across 80 counties in the United States. Then, we use the spatial distribution of notable urban features identified through the street view images, such as street furniture, sidewalks, building facades, and vegetation, to predict the socioeconomic profiles of their immediate neighborhood. Our results show that these urban features alone can account for up to 83% of the variance in people's travel behavior, 62% in poverty status, 64% in crime, and 68% in health behaviors. The results outperform models based on points of interest (POI), population, and other demographic data alone. Moreover, incorporating urban features captured from street view images can improve the explanatory power of these other methods by 5% to 25%. We propose urban visual intelligence as a process to uncover hidden city profiles, infer, and synthesize urban information with computer vision and street view images. This study serves as a foundation for future urban research interested in this process and understanding the role of visual aspects of the city.",
          "This paper addresses the topic of how architectural visual experience can be represented and utilised by a software system. The long-term aim is to equip an artificial agent with the ability to make sensible decisions about aesthetics and proportions. The focus of the investigation is on the feature of line distributions extracted from digital images of house facades. It is demonstrated how the dimensionality reduction method isomap can be applied to calculate non-linear street-manifolds where each point on the manifold corresponds to a house facade. Through interpolation between manifold points and the application of an inverse Hough transform, basic structure plans for new house facades are obtained. If the interpolated points are close to the manifold it can be argued that the new plans reflect the character of the surrounding streetscape. The method is also demonstrated using basic examples which can be represented by circles.",
          "Detection and vectorization of windows from building facades are important for building energy modeling, civil engineering, and architecture design. However, current applications still face the challenges of low accuracy and lack of automation. In this article we propose a new two-steps workflow for window segmentation and vectorization from facade images. First, we propose a cross field learning-based neural network architecture, which is augmented by a grid-based self-attention module for window segmentation from rectified facade images, resulting in pixel-wise window blobs. Second, we propose a regression neural network augmented by squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention blocks for window vectorization. The network takes the segmentation results together with the original facade image as input, and directly outputs the position of window corners, resulting in vectorized window objects with improved accuracy. In order to validate the effectiveness of our method, experiments are carried out on four public facades image datasets, with results usually yielding a higher accuracy for the final window prediction in comparison to baseline methods on four datasets in terms of intersection over union score, F1 score, and pixel accuracy.",
          "This paper presents a new approach for the prediction of substructures in building facades based on sparse observations. We automatically generate a small number of most likely hypotheses and provide probabilities for each of them. Probability density functions of model parameters which in most cases are non Gaussian and multimodal are learned from training data and approximated by Gaussian mixtures. Relations between model parameters are represented by non-linear constraints. For stochastic reasoning we design and apply a special kind of Bayesian networks which involves both discrete as well as continuous variables, a scenario which often suggests the use of approximate inference which however is infeasible in the face of a huge number of competing model hypotheses. In order to be able to scan huge model spaces avoiding the pitfalls of approximate reasoning and to exploit the potential of both observations and models, we combined Bayesian networks with constraint logic programs. We designed a method which breaks down the problem into a feasible number of subproblems for which exact inference can be applied. We illustrate our approach with building facades and demonstrate that particularly for buildings with strong symmetries number and position of windows can be deduced on the basis of ground plans alone.",
          "The ability to recognize the position and order of the floor-level lines that divide adjacent building floors can benefit many applications, for example, urban augmented reality (AR). This work tackles the problem of locating floor-level lines in street-view images, using a supervised deep learning approach. Unfortunately, very little data is available for training such a network - current street-view datasets contain either semantic annotations that lack geometric attributes, or rectified facades without perspective priors. To address this issue, we first compile a new dataset and develop a new data augmentation scheme to synthesize training samples by harassing (i) the rich semantics of existing rectified facades and (ii) perspective priors of buildings in diverse street views. Next, we design FloorLevel-Net, a multi-task learning network that associates explicit features of building facades and implicit floor-level lines, along with a height-attention mechanism to help enforce a vertical ordering of floor-level lines. The generated segmentations are then passed to a second-stage geometry post-processing to exploit self-constrained geometric priors for plausible and consistent reconstruction of floor-level lines. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations conducted on assorted facades in existing datasets and street views from Google demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Also, we present context-aware image overlay results and show the potentials of our approach in enriching AR-related applications.

          "The latest Deep Learning (DL) models for detection and classification have achieved an unprecedented performance over classical machine learning algorithms. However, DL models are black-box methods hard to debug, interpret, and certify. DL alone cannot provide explanations that can be validated by a non technical audience such as end-users or domain experts. In contrast, symbolic AI systems that convert concepts into rules or symbols - such as knowledge graphs - are easier to explain. However, they present lower generalization and scaling capabilities. A very important challenge is to fuse DL representations with expert knowledge. One way to address this challenge, as well as the performance-explainability trade-off is by leveraging the best of both streams without obviating domain expert knowledge. In this paper, we tackle such problem by considering the symbolic knowledge is expressed in form of a domain expert knowledge graph. We present the eXplainable Neural-symbolic learning (X-NeSyL) methodology, designed to learn both symbolic and deep representations, together with an explainability metric to assess the level of alignment of machine and human expert explanations. The ultimate objective is to fuse DL representations with expert domain knowledge during the learning process so it serves as a sound basis for explainability. In particular, X-NeSyL methodology involves the concrete use of two notions of explanation, both at inference and training time respectively: (1) EXPLANet: Expert-aligned eXplainable Part-based cLAssifier NETwork Architecture, a compositional convolutional neural network that makes use of symbolic representations, and (2) SHAP-Backprop, an explainable AI-informed training procedure that corrects and guides the DL process to align with such symbolic representations in form of knowledge graphs. We showcase X-NeSyL methodology using MonuMAI dataset for monument facade image classification, and demonstrate that with our approach, it is possible to improve explainability at the same time as performance.",
          "In recent years, as machine learning has been widely studied in the field of architecture, scholars have demonstrated that computers can be used to learn the graphical features of building facade generation. However, existing deep learning in facade generation has yet to generate only a single facade, without comprehensive generation of five facades including the roof. Moreover, most of the existing literature has utilized the Pix2Pix algorithm for facade generation experiments, failing to attempt to replace the original generator in Pix2Pix with a different generator for experiments. This study addresses the above issues by collecting and filtering entries from the international Solar Decathlon (SD competition) to obtain a data set. Subsequently, a low-rise residential building facade generation model based on the Pix2Pix neural network was constructed for training and testing. At the same time, the original U-net generator in Pix2Pix was replaced with three different generators, U-net++, HRNet and AttU-net, for training and test results were obtained. The results were evaluated from both subjective and objective aspects and it was found that the AttU-net generative network showed the best comprehensive generation performance for such facades. HRNet is acceptable if there is a need for fast training and generation",
          "3D urban maps with semantic labels and metric information are not only essential for the next generation robots such autonomous vehicles and city drones, but also help to visualize and augment local environment in mobile user applications. The machine vision challenge is to generate accurate urban maps from existing data with minimal manual annotation. In this work, we propose a novel methodology that takes GPS registered LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) point clouds and street view images as inputs and creates semantic labels for the 3D points clouds using a hybrid of rule-based parsing and learning-based labelling that combine point cloud and photometric features. The rule-based parsing boosts segmentation of simple and large structures such as street surfaces and building facades that span almost 75% of the point cloud data. For more complex structures, such as cars, trees and pedestrians, we adopt boosted decision trees that exploit both structure (LiDAR) and photometric (street view) features. We provide qualitative examples of our methodology in 3D visualization where we construct parametric graphical models from labelled data and in 2D image segmentation where 3D labels are back projected to the street view images. In quantitative evaluation we report classification accuracy and computing times and compare results to competing methods with three popular databases: NAVTEQ True, Paris-Rue-Madame and TLS (terrestrial laser scanned) Velodyne.",
          "Deep learning methods are typically data-hungry and require many labelled samples. Unfortunately, the amount of effort required to label the data has significantly hindered the application of deep learning methods, especially in 3D modelling tasks requiring heterogeneous samples. This paper proposes a semi-supervised adversarial recognition strategy embedded in the inverse procedural modelling engine to reduce data annotation costs for learning to model 3D facades. Beginning with textured level-of-details models, we use convolutional neural networks to recognise the types and estimate the parameters of windows from image patches. The window types and parameters are then assembled into the procedural grammar. A simple procedural engine is built inside off-the-shelf 3D modelling software, producing fine-grained window geometries. To obtain a useful model from a few labelled samples, we leverage a generative adversarial network to train the feature extractor in a semi-supervised manner. The adversarial training strategy exploits the unlabelled data to stabilise the training phase. Experiments using publicly available facade image datasets reveal that the proposed methods can improve classification accuracy and parameter estimation by approximately 10% and 50%, respectively, under the same network structure. In addition, performance gains are more pronounced when testing against unseen data featuring different facade styles.",
          "Coarse building mass models are now routinely generated at scales ranging from individual buildings to whole cities. Such models can be abstracted from raw measurements, generated procedurally, or created manually. However, these models typically lack any meaningful geometric or texture details, making them unsuitable for direct display. We introduce the problem of automatically and realistically decorating such models by adding semantically consistent geometric details and textures. Building on the recent success of generative adversarial networks (GANs), we propose FRANKENGAN, a cascade of GANs that creates plausible details across multiple scales over large neighborhoods. The various GANs are synchronized to produce consistent style distributions over buildings and neighborhoods. We provide the user with direct control over the variability of the output. We allow him/her to interactively specify the style via images and manipulate style-adapted sliders to control style variability. We test our system on several large-scale examples. The generated outputs are qualitatively evaluated via a set of perceptual studies and are found to be realistic, semantically plausible, and consistent in style.",
          "Although functional identifiability represents a key aspect for promoting visual connotation and sustainable usability in historic building groups, there is still no consensus on how to quantitatively describe its identification basis at a large scale. The recent emergence of the potentiality of deep learning and computer vision has provided an alternative to traditional empirical-based judgment, which is limited by its subjective bias and high traversal costs. To address these challenges, this study aims to build a workflow for a visual analysis of function and facade to extract the different contributions that facade elements provide to functional expression. The approach is demonstrated with an experiment on a section of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) where large-scale historical buildings images were categorized to identify functions using deep learning, together with activation and substance for visual calculations. First, the dataset aggregated with images of historic buildings along the CER was used to identify functional categories using SE-DenseNet merging channel attention. The results of the model visualized using t-SNE and Grad-CAM were then used to analyze the relationships of facade features across functional categories and differences in elemental feature representation across functional prototypes. The results show the following: (1) SE-Densenet can more efficiently identify building functions from the closely linked facade images of historic building groups, with the average accuracy reaching 85.84%. (2) Urban-rural differences exist not only in the count of spatial distributions among the CER's historic building groups, but also in a significant visual divergence between functions related to urban life and those involved in the military, industry, and railways. (3) Windows and walls occupy areas with more characteristics, but their decorative elements have a higher intensity of features. The findings could enhance the objective understanding and deeper characteristics of the historical building group system, contributing to integrated conservation and characteristic sustainability.",
          "In this work we test the power of prediction of deep learning for detection of buildings from aerial laser scanner point cloud information. Automatic extraction of built features from remote sensing data is of extreme interest for many applications. In particular latest paradigms of 3D mapping of buildings, such as CityGML and BIM, can benefit from an initial determination of building geometries. In this work we used a LiDAR dataset of urban environment from the ISPRS benchmark on urban object detection. The dataset is labelled with eight classes, two were used for this investigation: roof and facades. The objective is to test how TensorFlow neural network for deep learning can predict these two classes. Results show that for root and facades semantic classes respectively, recall is 84% and 76% and precision is 72% and 63%. The number and distribution of correct points well represent the geometry, thus allowing to use them as support for CityGML and BIM modelling. Further tuning of the hidden layers of the DL model will likely improve results and will be tested in future investigations.",
          "This letter presents a novel method for automated footprint extraction of building facades from mobile LiDAR point clouds. The proposed method first generates the georeferenced feature image of a mobile LiDAR point cloud and then uses image segmentation to extract contour areas which contain facade points of buildings, points of trees, and points of other objects in the georeferenced feature image. After all the points in each contour area are extracted, a classification based on principal component analysis (PCA) method is adopted to identify building objects from point clouds extracted in contour areas. Then, all the points in a building object are segmented into different planes using the random sample consensus algorithm. For each building, points in facade planes are chosen to calculate the direction, the start point, and the end point of the facade footprints using PCA. Finally, footprints of different facades of building are refined, harmonized, and joined. Two data sets of downtown areas and one data set of a residential area captured by Optech's LYNX mobile mapping system were tested to verify the validities of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides a promising and valid solution for automatically extracting building facade footprints from mobile LiDAR point clouds.",
          "This study is part of a project which investigates computational principles which underlie perception and representation of architectural streetscape character. Some of the principles can be associated with fundamental concepts in brain theory and Gestalt psychology. For the experimental analysis streetscapes were represented by sequences of digital images of house facades which were prepared by a team of researchers from architecture. Two methods for non-linear dimensionality reduction, isomap and maximum variance unfolding, were applied to a set of Hough arrays (for tines) of the given images. An analysis of the extracted streetmanifolds revealed groupings of house facades with similar visual character and proportions. Comparative tests were conducted on a simple cylinder shaped example manifold to evaluate the geometric stability of the two dimensionality reduction methods. All experiments addressed variations of the distance metric and the neighbourhood parameter.",
          "The influence of gender is often overlooked in spatial studies of consumption places, and it is challenging to track consumers' perceived preferences due to measurement efficiency and scope issues. Based on machine learning techniques, this paper proposes an approach to map perceived preferences from the local to the city level, and evaluate the physical forms and distribution characteristics of gender-specific consumption places. The application steps are: First, acquire POI (point of interest) coordinates of consumption places to obtain street-view images; then, 30 respondents of each gender are invited to score the sampled images. The area proportions of four prominent visual elements in the building facade are identified by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), after which Random Forest Model is applied to predict the preference scores of all POIs. Finally, the distribution equity of the consumption places of each gender is evaluated by Equilibrium Index. Applying this method in Beijing, we can identify the gender divergence in four aspects of form, function, scale, and administrative district, locate the area with a poor supply of consumption places, and finally provide optimisation suggestions. The method improves the efficiency and scope of measuring consumers' perceived preferences, while identifying and optimising the quality of consumption places.",
          "Facade image parsing is essential to the semantic understanding and 3-D reconstruction of urban scenes. Considering the occlusion and appearance ambiguity in single-view images and the easy acquisition of multiple views, in this letter, we propose a multiview enhanced deep architecture for facade parsing. The highlight of this architecture is a cross-view feature aggregation module that can learn to choose and fuse useful convolutional neural network (CNN) features from nearby views to enhance the representation of a target view. Benefitting from the multiview enhanced representation, the proposed architecture can better deal with the ambiguity and occlusion issues. Moreover, our cross-view feature aggregation module can be straightforwardly integrated into existing single-image parsing frameworks. Extensive comparison experiments and ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method and the validity and transportability of the cross-view feature aggregation module.",

The purpose is to explore the feasibility of using image generation technology to achieve rapid recognition and generation of building facade based on pix2pix. This paper also discusses the application scenarios of this technology. The existing building facade datasets and the self-made Chinese traditional building datasets are used to test and verify that pix2pix under different types of datasets can nicely identify and generate facade images. Then we summarize a set of working methods based on GAN to realize the overall or local reconstruction design of the facade, so as to provide new ideas for the improvement of the efficiency of related industries and the expansion of teaching tools.",
          "We present a passive computer vision method that exploits existing mapping and navigation databases in order to automatically create 3D building models. Our method defines a grammar for representing changes in building geometry that approximately follow the Manhattan-world assumption which states there is a predominance of three mutually orthogonal directions in the scene. By using multiple calibrated aerial images, we extend previous Manhattan-world methods to robustly produce a single, coherent, complete geometric model of a building with partial textures. Our method uses an optimization to discover a 3D building geometry that produces the same set of facade orientation changes observed in the captured images. We have applied our method to several real-world buildings and have analyzed our approach using synthetic buildings.",
          "The semantic parsing of building facade images is a fundamental yet challenging task in urban scene understanding. Existing works sought to tackle this task by using facade grammars or convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The former can hardly generate parsing results coherent with real images while the latter often fails to capture relationships among facade elements. In this letter, we propose a pyramid atrous large kernel (ALK) network (ALKNet) for the semantic segmentation of facade images. The pyramid ALKNet captures long-range dependencies among building elements by using ALK modules in multiscale feature maps. It makes full use of the regular structures of facades to aggregate useful nonlocal context information and thereby is capable of dealing with challenging image regions caused by occlusions, ambiguities, and so on. Experiments on both rectified and unrectified facade data sets show that ALKNet has better performances than those of state-of-the-art methods.",
          "In this paper we present an approach for semantic interpretation of facade images based on a Convolutional Network. Our network processes the input images in a fully convolutional way and generates pixel-wise predictions. We show that there is no need for large datasets to train the network when transfer learning is employed, i.e., a part of an already existing network is used and fine-tuned, and when the available data is augmented by using deformed patches of the images for training. The network is trained end-to-end with patches of the images and each patch is augmented independently. To undo the downsampling for the classification, we add deconvolutional layers to the network. Outputs of different layers of the network are combined to achieve more precise pixel-wise predictions. We demonstrate the potential of our network based on results for the eTRIMS (Korc and Forstner, 2009) dataset reduced to facades.",
          "Though many methods have been proposed, image completion still remains challenge; besides textured patterns completion, it often requires high-level understanding of scenes and objects being completed. More recently, deep convolutional generative adversarial networks have been turned into an efficient tool for image completion. Manually specified transformation methods are having been replaced with training neural nets. Hand-engineered loss calculations for training the generator are replaced by the loss function provided by the discriminator. With existing deep learning-based approaches, image completion results in high quality but may still lack high-level feature details or contain artificial appearance. In our completion architecture, we leverage a fully convolutional generator with two subnetworks as our basic completion approach and divide the problem into two steps: The first subnetwork generates the outline of a completed image in a new domain, and the second subnetwork translates the outline to a visually realistic output with image-to-image translation. The feedforward fully convolutional network can complete images with holes of any size at any location. We compare our method with several existing ones on representative datasets such as CelebA, ImageNet, Places2 and CMP Facade. The evaluations demonstrate that our model significantly improves the completion results.",
          "Facade features represent segmentations of building surfaces and can serve as a building framework. Extracting facade features from three-dimensional (3D) point cloud data (3D PCD) is an efficient method for 3D building modeling. By combining the advantages of 3D PCD and two-dimensional optical images, this study describes the creation of a highly accurate building facade feature extraction method from 3D PCD with a focus on structural information. The new extraction method involves three major steps: image feature extraction, exploration of the mapping method between the image features and 3D PCD, and optimization of the initial 3D PCD facade features considering structural information. Results show that the new method can extract the 3D PCD facade features of buildings more accurately and continuously. The new method is validated using a case study. In addition, the effectiveness of the new method is demonstrated by comparing it with the range image-extraction method and the optical image-extraction method in the absence of structural information. The 3D PCD facade features extracted by the new method can be applied in many fields, such as 3D building modeling and building information modeling.",
          "Recent years have shown a shift from pure geometric 3D city models to data with semantics. This is induced by new applications (e.g. Virtual/Augmented Reality) and also a requirement for concepts like Smart Cities. However, essential urban semantic data like building use categories is often not available. We present a first step in bridging this gap by proposing a pipeline to use crawled urban imagery and link it with ground truth cadastral data as an input for automatic building use classification. We aim to extract this city-relevant semantic information automatically from Street View (SV) imagery. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) proved to be extremely successful for image interpretation, however, require a huge amount of training data. Main contribution of the paper is the automatic provision of such training datasets by linking semantic information as already available from databases provided from national mapping agencies or city administrations to the corresponding facade images extracted from SV. Finally, we present first investigations with a CNN and an alternative classifier as a proof of concept.",
          "Procedural modeling has proven to be a very valuable tool in the field of architecture. In the last few years, research has soared to automatically create procedural models from images. However, current algorithms for this process of inverse procedural modeling rely on the assumption that the building style is known. So far, the determination of the building style has remained a manual task. In this paper, we propose an algorithm which automates this process through classification of architectural styles from facade images. Our classifier first identifies the images containing buildings, then separates individual facades within an image and determines the building style. This information could then be used to initialize the building reconstruction process. We have trained our classifier to distinguish between several distinct architectural styles, namely Flemish Renaissance, Haussmannian and Neoclassical. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on various street-side images.",
          "The fast and automatic facade extraction method is an important step to retrieve actual information about cities. It helps to maintain a public registry, may be used to examine the technical condition of buildings or in process of city planning. We propose an automatic method to detect and retrieve building facades from spherical images. Our method uses deep learning models trained on automatically labelled spherical images collected in the virtual city we have generated. Finally, we compare the proposed solution using three different deep learning models with a classic method. Our experiment revealed that the proposed approach has a similar or better performance than the current methods. Moreover, our solution works with unprepared data, while existing methods require data pre-processing.",
          "Traditional techniques for recording and modelling historical buildings using surveying instruments and CAD are tedious and time-consuming procedures, which do not provide detailed descriptions of complex facades. Recent developments in photogrammetry and laser-scanning techniques present non-contact, flexible and accessible surveying tools for 2D-3D recording. This paper discusses the potential for combining photogrammetry, laser scanning and computer vision for the documentation of heritage sites. By these means the efficiency of data collection can be optimized, and accurate true orthophotos of the studied structure can be generated using precise 3D surface representations derived from laser scanning and overlapping digital images. The final product allows the creation of detailed and complete facade plans, which are both graphically superior and accurate. The paper includes a study of the approach applied to historic buildings in Gharissa, one of the best preserved heritage villages in Jordan.",
          "Realistic representation of building walls from images is an important aspect of scene understanding and has many applications. Often, images of buildings are the only input for texturing 3D models, and these images may be occluded by vegetation. One task of image inpainting is to remove these clutter objects. Since the disturbing objects can also be of a larger scale, modern deep learning techniques should be applied to replace them as realistically and context-aware as possible. To support an inpainting network, it is useful to include a-priori information. An example of a network that considers edge images is the two-stage GAN model denoted as EdgeConnect. This idea is taken up in this work and further developed to a three-stage GAN (3GAN) model for facade images by additionally incorporating semantic label images. By inpainting the label images, not only a clear geometric structure but also class information, like position and shape of windows and their typical color distribution, are provided to the model. This model is compared qualitatively and quantitatively with the conventional version of EdgeConnect and another well-known deep-learning-based approach on inpainting which is based on partial convolutions. This latter approach was outperformed by both GAN-based methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively. While the quantitative evaluation showed that the conventional EdgeConnect method performs minimally best, the proposed method yields a slightly better representation of specific facade elements.",
          "We present a saliency-guided algorithm for detecting the locations of repetitive structures on building facades. First, the global and local saliencies of each point are determined by measuring the global rarity and the local distinctness. The saliency map is utilized to adaptively extract the salient points. Second, the salient points are vertically sliced. A curve can be derived by counting the total number of points in each slice. Then, the curve is converted into a square wave to locate the vertical splitting position. Next, each segment is horizontally sliced, similar to the vertical splitting. The salient points are partitioned into repetitive candidates after the vertical and horizontal splitting. Finally, the repetitive candidates are refined according to the similarity of the neighborhood and the regularity of the arrangement. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can quickly and effectively extract repetitions from facade point clouds.",
          "Building retrofit is an important facet in the drive to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. However, delivering building retrofit at scale is a significant challenge, especially in how to automate the process of building surveying. On-site survey by expert surveyors is the main approach in the industry. This can lead to a high workload if planning retrofit at a large-scale. An advanced vehicle-mounted data capturing system has been built to collect urban environmental multi-spectral data. The data contains substantial information that is essential in identifying building retrofit needs. Although the data capturing system is able to collect data in a highly-efficient manner, the data analysis is still a big data challenge to apply the system into delivering building retrofit plans. In this paper, a street-view building facade image segmentation model is designed as the foundation of the holistic data analysis framework. The model is developed on the deep learning-based semantic segmentation technology and uses an ensemble learning strategy. The object detection technology is fused into the model as an magnifier to improve the model performance on small objects and boundary predictions. The model has achieved state-of-the-art levels of accuracy on a built street-view building facade image dataset.",
          "Array interferometric synthetic aperture radar (Array InSAR) has a 3-D resolution capability and solves the layover problem in interferometric SAR (InSAR) by arranging multiple antennas in the cross-orbit direction. Airborne Array InSAR point clouds are obtained from two scans for complete building information in urban areas, resulting in very low overlapping point cloud. The existing methods are difficult to extract the identical features for the registration of Array InSAR point clouds. To this end, a robust registration approach Array InSAR point clouds in urban areas is proposed in this study. The main contribution of this article is raising the theoretically optimal transformation for achieving point cloud registration, considering the constraint from parallel facades of a certain building. Point density estimation is adopted to retain building facade points for initial registration. The facade pairs of a specific building are then matched and divided into two categories by judging whether one contains the concave-convex features or not, for performing rotation rectification and fine shift fixation, respectively. Experimental results of both simulated and real data validate the feasibility and reliability of our approach. For the simulated data, the results reach an average rotation error of about 0.01 degrees and an average translation error of less than 0.8 m. For the real data, two evaluation criteria are designed for the lack of reference data. The results reach an average of 0.4 degrees of the defined angle difference and less 0.8-m distance difference from the source facades center to the normal extension of the target facades.",
          "The construction industry has made great strides in recent decades by utilizing computer programs, including computer aided design programs. However, compared to the manufacturing sector, labor productivity is low because of the high proportion of knowledge-based tasks and simple repetitive tasks. Therefore, knowledge-based task efficiency should be improved through the visual recognition of information by computers. A computer requires a large amount of training data, such as the ImageNet project, to recognize visual information. This paper proposes facade datasets that are efficiently constructed by quickly collecting facade data through road-view images generated from web portals and automatically labeled using deep learning as part of the construction of image datasets for visual recognition construction by a computer. Therefore, we attempted to automatically label facade images to quickly generate large-scale facade datasets with much less effort than the existing research methods. Simultaneously, we constructed datasets for a part of Dongseong-ro, Daegu Metropolitan City, and analyzed their utility and reliability. It was confirmed that the computer could extract significant facade information from the road-view images by recognizing the visual information of the facade image. In addition, we verified the characteristics of the building construction image datasets. This study suggests the possibility of securing quantitative and qualitative facade design knowledge by extracting facade design information from facades anywhere in the world. Previous studies mainly collected facade images through camera photography to construct databases, but in this study, a significant part of the database construction process was shortened through automation. In the case of facade automatic image labeling studies, it is the facade-based automatic 3D modeling which has been primarily studied, but it is difficult to find a study to extract data for facade design research.",
          "This article presents a machine learning approach to automatic land use categorization based on a convolutional artificial neural network architecture. It is intended to support the detection and classification of building facades in order to associate each building with its respective land use. Replacing the time-consuming manual acquisition of images in the field and subsequent interpretation of the data with computer-aided techniques facilitates the creation of useful maps for urban planning. A specific future objective of this study is to monitor the commercial evolution in the city of Vila Velha, Brazil. The initial step is object detection based on a deep network architecture called Faster R-CNN. The model is trained on a collection of street-level photographs of buildings of desired land uses, from a database of annotated images of building facades. Images are extracted from Google Street View scenes. Furthermore, in order to save manual annotation time, a semi-supervised dual pipeline method is proposed that uses a pre-trained predictor model from the Places365 database to learn unannotated images. Several backbones were connected to the Faster R-CNN architecture for comparisons. The experimental results with the VGG backbone show an improvement over published works, with an average accuracy of 86.49%.",
          "In the era of Big Data, 3D electronic maps and GIS are widely used in geographic information analysis and urban computing. However, the production cost of electronic maps is expensive, especially that of 3D modeling of buildings that are important geographic objects. In this paper, we propose a fast and low-cost method for 3D modeling of buildings by using building images provided by online electronic maps. The method employs edge detection to identify the bottom contours of buildings in 2D building images; it then takes DNN-based object detection and semantic segmentation to spill a single building from 3D building images, and calculates the height of the building facades. We use this approach to model 22,740 3D buildings in the urban area of Nanjing, and take a 5m high-resolution electronic map as the benchmark to evaluate the modeling accuracy. The results show that image-based 3D building modeling is able to provide acceptable-precision 3D geometry information of buildings.",
          "Collecting 3D point cloud data of buildings is important for many applications such as urban mapping, renovation, preservation, and energy simulation. However, laser-scanned point clouds are often difficult to analyze, visualize, and interpret due to incompletely scanned building facades caused by numerous sources of defects such as noise, occlusions, and moving objects. Several point cloud scene completion algorithms have been proposed in the literature, but they have been mostly applied to individual objects or small-scale indoor environments and not on large-scale scans of building facades. This paper introduces a method of performing point cloud scene completion of building facades using orthographic projection and generative adversarial inpainting methods. The point cloud is first converted into the 2D structured representation of depth and color images using an orthographic projection approach. Then, a data-driven 2D inpainting approach is used to predict the complete version of the scene, given the incomplete scene in the image domain. The 2D inpainting process is fully automated and uses a customized generative-adversarial network based on Pix2Pix that is trainable end-to-end. The inpainted 2D image is finally converted back into a 3D point cloud using depth remapping. The proposed method is compared against several baseline methods, including geometric methods such as Poisson reconstruction and hole-filling, as well as learning-based methods such as the point completion network (PCN) and TopNet. Performance evaluation is carried out based on the task of reconstructing real-world building facades from partial laser-scanned point clouds. Experimental results using the performance metrics of voxel precision, voxel recall, position error, and color error showed that the proposed method has the best performance overall.",
          "In this work, we present a framework to detect objects embedded in complex perspective geometry. Our goal is to accurately identify objects such as people standing in balconies or windows on building facades of surrounding buildings. Compared to traditional computer vision work focused on activity analysis from a horizontal view, our framework provides a solution for the application domain of mobile surveillance in urban areas. A novel solution for a monocular camera is formulated by tightly coupling various computational modules including geometric analysis, segmentation, scale estimation, and object detection. In particular, our proposed approach alleviates the effect of the perspective geometry and corresponding distortion in object appearance effectively, and provides accurate scale priors to eliminate unlikely object detection hypotheses. The experimental results on collected video dataset show that the proposed approach is more accurate than traditional detection approaches based on brute-force scanning windows.",
          "Street-level imagery contains a variety of visual information about the facades of Points of Interest (POIs). In addition to general morphological features, signs on the facades of, primarily, business-related POIs could be a valuable source of information about the type and identity of a POI. Recent advancements in computer vision could leverage visual information from street-level imagery, and contribute to the classification of POIs. However, there is currently a gap in existing literature regarding the use of visual labels contained in street-level imagery, where their value as indicators of POI categories is assessed. This paper presents Scene-Text Semantics (ST-Sem), a novel method that leverages visual labels (e.g., texts, logos) from street-level imagery as complementary information for the categorization of business-related POIs. Contrary to existing methods that fuse visual and textual information at a feature-level, we propose a late fusion approach that combines visual and textual cues after resolving issues of incorrect digitization and semantic ambiguity of the retrieved textual components. Experiments on two existing and a newly-created datasets show that ST-Sem can outperform visual-only approaches by 80% and related multimodal approaches by 4%.",
          "The experience of walking through a city is influenced by amenities and the visual qualities of its built environment. This paper uses thousands of pedestrian trajectories obtained from GPS signals to construct a desirability index for streets in Boston. We create the index by comparing the actual paths taken by pedestrians with the shortest path between any origin-destination pairs. The index captures pedestrians' willingness to deviate from their shortest path and provides a measure of the scenic and experience value provided by different parts of the city. We then use computer vision techniques combined with georeferenced data to measure the built environment of streets. We show that desirable streets have better access to public amenities such as parks, sidewalks, and urban furniture. They are also sinuous, visually enclosed, have less complex facades, and have more diverse business establishments. These results further our understanding of the value that the built environment brings to pedestrians, enhancing our capacity to design more lively and functional environments.",
          "Image segmentation is a fundamental task that has benefited from recent advances in machine learning. One type of segmentation, of particular interest to computer vision, is that of urban segmentation. Although recent solutions have leveraged on deep neural networks, approaches usually do not consider regularities appearing in facade structures (e.g., windows are often in groups of similar alignment, size, or spacing patterns) as well as additional urban structures such as building footprints and roofs. Moreover, both satellite and street view images are often noisy and occluded, thus getting the complete structure segmentation from a partial observation is difficult. Our key observations are that facades and other urban structures exhibit regular structures, and additional views are often available. In this paper, we present a novel framework (RFCNet) that consists of three modules to achieve multiple goals. Specifically, we propose Regularization to improve the regularities given an initial segmentation, Fusion that fuses multiple views of the segmentation, and Completion that can infer the complete structure if necessary. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively for multiple facade datasets. Furthermore, by applying our framework to other urban structures (e.g., building footprints and roofs), we demonstrate our approach can be generalized to various pattern types.",
          "The judgment of facade styles is an important part of the sustainable utilization and restorative process of historical architectures. Contemporary Harbin needs the help of modern architectural facade forms in the planning of the famous historic city, especially with the facade renovation of old architectures with non-cultural heritage. This paper discusses the possibility of applying advanced image recognition algorithms to the classification of the modern Harbin architectural facade styles and argues that the keys to the classification and positioning of the styles are the forms, the details, and the decorative patterns of the architectural facades, together with the deformation and the quantitative variation factors of the facade decoration symbols. Based on the conventional classification method, the facade styles of Harbin modern architecture were divided into 12 categories after data analysis. To better capture the overall structure information and the style features of the local components in the architectural images, the group convolution and the dilated convolution were added into the ResNet model, and then, the improved channel attention mechanism was introduced to construct a novel CA-MSResNet model. The CA-MSResNet model could more accurately identify the morphological elements and the style categories of the architectures, and the average accuracy reached 87.5%. These techniques, with their promising results, are expected to be further applied in the future research on the sustainable utilization and renovation of Harbin modern architecture.",
          "In this paper we present a novel street scene semantic recognition framework, which takes advantage of 3D point cloud captured by a high definition LiDAR laser scanner. An important problem in object recognition is the need for sufficient labeled training data to learn robust classifiers. We show how to significantly reduce the need for manually labeled training data by reduction of scene complexity using non-supervised ground and building segmentation. Our system first automatically segments grounds point cloud. Then, using binary range image processing building facades will be detected. Remained point cloud will grouped into voxels which are then transformed to super voxels. Local 3D features extracted from super voxels are classified by trained boosted decision trees and labeled with semantic classes e.g. tree, pedestrian, car. Given labeled 3D points cloud and 2D image with known viewing camera pose, the proposed association module aligned collections of 3D points to the groups of 2D image pixel to parsing 2D cubic images.",
          "In architecture, urban culture inheritance plays a nontrivial role in the urban renovation of a city. The existing design workflow for architects is laborious from the research phase to the final plans, and yet the results are subjective, especially when facing a large-scale urban renovation. Recent works show that generative adversarial networks (GANs) have surprising potential for creating un-presented images following certain rules under various domains, including architecture. However, research on adopting GANs to optimize the conventional design process of historic urban areas renovation is still missing. This study contributes as a decision support tool for urban renovation based on GANs to abstract historic architecture styles and automatically generate stylized facades. One self-made dataset of facade and label information from Harbin Central Street was created, and one data augmentation process was proposed and examined. The generated designs were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, and demonstrated high accuracy, reality, and diversity levels. Two in situ and off-site applications proved the feasibility and adaptability of the proposed workflow. Through all evaluations and application cases, it is justified that the proposed GAN-based design strategy can greatly benefit the conventional historic urban area renovation design process.",
          "Given the present size of modern cities, it is beyond the perceptual capacity of most people to develop a good knowledge about the qualities of the urban space at every street corner. Correspondingly, for planners, it is also difficult to accurately answer questions such as 'where the quality of the physical environment is the most dilapidated in the city that regeneration should be given first consideration' and 'in fast urbanising cities, how is the city appearance changing'. To address this issue, in the present study, we present a computer vision method that contains three machine learning models for the large-scale and automatic evaluation on the qualities of the urban environment by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and wide-coverage street view images. From various physical qualities that have been identified by previous research to be important for the urban visual experience, we choose two key qualities, the construction and maintenance quality of building facade and the continuity of street wall, to be measured in this research. To test the validity of the proposed method, we compare the machine scores with public rating scores collected on-site from 752 passers-by at 56 locations in the city. We show that the machine learning models can produce a medium-to-good estimation of people's real experience, and the modelling results can be applied in many ways by researchers, planners and local residents.",
          "Outdoor advertising influences the visual environment of any modem city. Advertising and information signs on building facades are one of the types of outdoor advertising. As a rule, there are laws and design codes in cities that define permissible look of such signs. At the same time, in metropolises, there is a problem of timely detection of advertising constructions on facades that violate these rules. City-scale monitoring of facade conditions is beyond the capabilities of any city's authorities. To address this issue, we propose a solution which combines street-view maps and machine learning to automate the process of searching for law-breaking advertising objects on building facades. We develop a dataset for a machine learning model and a set of checks for detected advertising objects to check their legality. The resulting approach can provide data for future research and help maintain coherent urban visual environment.",
          "Semantic Inpainting on Segmentation Map (SISM) aims to manipulate segmentation maps by semantics. Recent works show SISM provides semantic-aware auxiliary information for better style or structure manipulations. Providing structural assistance, segmentation maps have been broadly used as an intermediate interface to achieve better image manipulation. Mainstream solutions of image manipulation use Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) globally, locally or jointly. It is also applicable to SISM. However, the discriminator of global GAN is easier fooled, because the majority of its input is the same as the ground-truth, which is hard to fully mitigate the inconsistency between inpainted areas and the context. The inconsistency is more difficult for local GAN to address, due to the lack of context in its input. To mitigate the inconsistency, we propose a novel Multi-Expansion (MEx) loss. It is implemented by the adversarial loss on MEx areas. Each MEx area has the inpainted area as dominance and keeps knowledge of the scene context, so the consistency of the SISM results can be boosted. We propose an approximation of MEx loss, i.e., A-MEx loss, to further enhance the stability and usability. Besides performing well on SISM tasks, MEx loss also performs impressively on natural image inpainting. Extensive experiments on the two tasks demonstrate the advantages of our model over existing methods on four challenging datasets, such as a 2.59% increase in Hamm on SISM in Cityscape and a decrease of 5.00% FID on natural image inpainting in CMP Facade. The code of our work is available at: https://github.com/he159ok/AMExMEx-Loss.",
          "In the context of the global construction of low-carbon cities and residents' pursuit of healthy living, the improvement in the urban walking environment has gradually been emphasized in the field of planning and transportation research. Using Harbin, China, as an example, this paper combines gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs) and impact-asymmetry analysis (IAA) methods to explore the differences in residents' preferences for the pedestrian environment needs in old and new urban areas, analyze the asymmetric relationship between walking environment factors and overall satisfaction, and provide a sound basis for the renewal and reconstruction of the walking environment in old urban areas and the improvement of the walking environment in new urban areas. The factors affecting the pedestrian environment in the old and new urban areas are similar and different, with the aesthetics and safety and the aesthetics and comfort of the pedestrian environment having a greater impact on the old and new urban areas, respectively. According to the results of the IAA, the old city should focus on improving green landscaping, street furniture, the uncivilized behavior of pedestrians, pavement encroachment, barrier-free facilities, and the speed of motor vehicles; the new city should focus on improving the building facade effect, the uncivilized behavior of pedestrians, and green landscaping.",
          "3D modeling remains a notoriously difficult task for novices despite significant research effort to provide intuitive and automated systems. We tackle this problem by combining the strengths of two popular domains: sketch-based modeling and procedural modeling. On the one hand, sketch-based modeling exploits our ability to draw but requires detailed, unambiguous drawings to achieve complex models. On the other hand, procedural modeling automates the creation of precise and detailed geometry but requires the tedious definition and parameterization of procedural models. Our system uses a collection of simple procedural grammars, called snippets, as building blocks to turn sketches into realistic 3D models. We use a machine learning approach to solve the inverse problem of finding the procedural model that best explains a user sketch. We use nonphotorealistic rendering to generate artificial data for training convolutional neural networks capable of quickly recognizing the procedural rule intended by a sketch and estimating its parameters. We integrate our algorithm in a coarse-to-fine urban modeling system that allows users to create rich buildings by successively sketching the building mass, roof, facades, windows, and ornaments. A user study shows that by using our approach non-expert users can generate complex buildings in just a few minutes.",
          "In a great variety of applications, such as real-time robot localization and visual navigation, architectural design, 3D city reconstruction, building recognition in urban environments is required. In this work a comparative study of visual feature extraction methods for building retrieval on urban databases is performed. To this end, a database of 183 building facades taken at two different regions near the center of Athens was created. Five feature extraction methods are used in order to capture visual properties. Features between images are then matched using RANSAC algorithm and a visual transformation is calculated. Comparative retrieval results are provided and discussed.",
          "Facade parsing aims to decompose a building facade image into semantic regions of the facade objects. Considering each architectural element on a facade as a parameterized rectangle, we formulate the facade parsing task as object detection, allowing overlapping and nesting, which will support structural 3D modeling and editing for further applications. In contrast to general object detection, the spatial arrangement regularity and appearance similarity between the facade elements of the same category provide valuable context for accurate element localization. In this paper, we propose to exploit the spatial arrangement regularity and appearance similarity of facade elements in a detection framework. Our element-arrangement context network (EACNet) consists of two unidirectional attention branches, one to capture the column-context and the other to capture row-context to aggregate element-specific features from multiple instances on the facade. We conduct extensive experiments on four public datasets (ECP, CMP, Graz50, and eTRIMS). The proposed EACNet achieves the highest mIoU (82.1% on ECP, 77.35% on Graz50, and 82.3% on eTRIMS) compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Both the quantitative and qualitative evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual unidirectional attention branches to parse facade elements.",
          "In this study, we propose a straight-line-segment feature-extraction method for the building-facade point-cloud data based on slicing to improve the existing method of detecting and extracting the straight-line-segment features from the building-fa ade point-cloud data, which exhibits problems of missed detection and less-thanoptimal accuracy. Further, the point cloud is sliced along the three coordinate axes after adjusting the point-cloud attitude of the building to ensure that its orientation is consistent with the Y-coordinate axis. Then, the feature points on each slice arc extracted, and straight-line-segment clustering is applied to the extracted feature points based on the cylinder growth method. Finally, the straight-line-segment fitting of the feature points is performed using the 1-norm minimum residual algorithm, and the endpoints of the straight line segment arc adjusted and refined. Subsequently, we validate the proposed method by applying it to several sets of experimental data; the experimental results exhibit improved accuracy, precision, and recall. The extraction accuracy of the straight line segment is half the average point spacing in the point cloud. The precision of the proposed method for extracting straight line segments is increased by 2.4% on average than that of the plane segmentation and image detection methods, whereas the recall is increased by 18.1% on average. Thus, our proposed method can accurately and effectively extract straight line segments from the building-facade point-cloud data.",
          "Facade parsing is an essential process before the 3-D modeling of digital or virtual 3-D city models. The existing grammar-based approaches for facade parsing rely on strong prior knowledge but can obtain facade parts with better structure. Pixelwise-segmentation-based approaches achieve facade parsing with much less knowledge but the resulting structure of facade parts is normally incomplete. Both these approaches are restricted by their high reliance on the data set. Therefore, they cannot be applied for facade parsing with complex scenes. To address this issue, we built a large street-level data set by taking Mapillary images as the training data for more general scenes. At the same time, we propose a new pipeline based on convolutional neural network (CNN) that combines pixelwise segmentation and global object detection to achieve better results for facade parsing. Our pipeline can be applied to facade images after rectification and street-level facade images with complex scenes. The result of the ablation study demonstrates that the design of our pipeline is effective. We test our pipeline on the classic ECP2011 data set and our new large street-level data set. Our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results for both the data sets: an accuracy of 98.2% and the mean average precision (mAP) of 98.8% on the ECP2011 data set as well as the mAP of 81.1% for facade parts parsing on our street-level data set.",
          "This paper presents an architecture for image analysis that is based on feature hierarchies. The architecture allows for shift, scale, and topological invariant detection of objects. Features are efficiently represented and combined dynamically during the detection process. The respective feature detectors are trained using a supervised learning scheme. The method discussed here can also solve the problem of segmenting an image into image regions that correspond to detected features. This segmentation can be done through backtracking of feature information in the feature hierarchy. We applied the method for a set of images where building facades are analyzed and show experimental results that demonstrate the capabilities of the system.",
          "In this paper we present a novel street scene semantic recognition framework, which takes advantage of 3D point clouds captured by a high-definition LiDAR laser scanner. An important problem in object recognition is the need for sufficient labeled training data to learn robust classifiers. In this paper we show how to significantly reduce the need for manually labeled training data by reduction of scene complexity using non-supervised ground and building segmentation. Our system first automatically segments grounds point cloud, this is because the ground connects almost all other objects and we will use a connect component based algorithm to oversegment the point clouds. Then, using binary range image processing building facades will be detected. Remained point cloud will grouped into voxels which are then transformed to super voxels. Local 3D features extracted from super voxels are classified by trained boosted decision trees and labeled with semantic classes e.g. tree, pedestrian, car, etc. The proposed method is evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively on a challenging fixed-position Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) Velodyne data set and two Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS), Paris-rue-Madam and NAVTEQ True databases. Robust scene parsing results are reported.",
          "Windows are key components of building facades. Detecting windows, crucial to 3D semantic reconstruction and scene parsing, is a challenging task in computer vision. Early methods try to solve window detection by using hand-crafted features and traditional classifiers. However, these methods are unable to handle the diversity of window instances in real scenes and suffer from heavy computational costs. Recently, convolutional neural networks based object detection algorithms attract much attention due to their good performances. Unfortunately, directly training them for challenging window detection cannot achieve satisfying results. In this paper, we propose an approach for window detection. It involves an improved Faster R-CNN architecture for window detection, featuring in a window region proposal network, an RoI feature fusion and a context enhancement module. Besides, a post optimization process is designed by the regular distribution of windows to refine detection results obtained by the improved deep architecture. Furthermore, we present a newly collected dataset which is the largest one for window detection in real street scenes to date. Experimental results on both existing datasets and the new dataset show that the proposed method has outstanding performance.",
          "Buildings and other man-made objects, for many reasons such as economical or aesthetic, are often characterized by their symmetry. The latter predominates in the design of building footprints and building parts such as facades. Thus the identification and modeling of this valuable information facilitates the reconstruction of these buildings and their parts. This article presents a novel approach for the automatic identification and modelling of symmetries and their hierarchical structures in building footprints, providing an important prior for facade and roof reconstruction. The uncertainty of symmetries is explicitly addressed using supervised machine learning methods, in particular Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Unlike classical statistical methods, for SVMs assumptions on the a priori distribution of the data are not required. Both axial and translational symmetries are detected. The quality of the identified major and minor symmetry axes is assessed by a least squares based adjustment. Context-free formal grammar rules are used to model the hierarchical and repetitive structure of the underlying footprints. We present an algorithm which derives grammar rules based on the previously acquired symmetry information and using lexical analysis describing regular patterns and palindrome-like structures. This offers insights into the latent structures of building footprints and therefore describes the associated facade in a relational and compact way.",
          "Building facade elements are an important foundation for smart cities. As buildings exhibit an array of textures and geometric forms, the process of image acquisition is easily affected, although the robustness of texture in scenes (e.g., dilapidated buildings) is poor, with high point cloud data, and low recognition efficiency; therefore, the accuracy of building element extraction based on a single data source remains limited. In this research, a method for building facade element extraction based on multidimensional virtual semantic feature map ensemble learning and hierarchical clustering is proposed. Point clouds were obtained by multi-view images, and then the multidimensional virtual semantic feature maps, including color, texture, orientation, and curvature semantics, were acquired via reprojection. The multi-semantic feature block pre-segmentation, considering multiple features, was obtained by ensemble learning, and a hierarchical clustering strategy was established for to achieve fine extraction of building facade elements. Experiments were conducted across multiple building types, and the results showed that: 1) The method can use different virtual semantic feature map and clustering strategies to achieve accurate extraction of diverse building facade elements; 2) The method achieved joint learning tasks in both 2D and 3D space; and, 3) The proposed method achieved fine extraction of building elements with pixel accuracy (PA) over 70% in all experiments and mean intersection over union (mIoU) up to 95%, which were better than the image based method. In summary, this method offers a novel, more reliable method for segmenting and extracting building facade elements, which has important theoretical and practical significance.",
          "This paper introduces a fast and efficient segmentation technique for 2D images and 3D point clouds of building facades. Facades of buildings are highly structured and consequently most methods that have been proposed for this problem aim to make use of this strong prior information. Contrary to most prior work, we are describing a system that is almost domain independent and consists of standard segmentation methods. We train a sequence of boosted decision trees using auto-context features. This is learned using stacked generalization. We find that this technique performs better, or comparable with all previous published methods and present empirical results on all available 2D and 3D facade benchmark datasets. The proposed method is simple to implement, easy to extend, and very efficient at test-time inference.",
          "The parsing of building facades is a key component to the problem of 3D street scenes reconstruction, which is long desired in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based method for segmenting a facade into semantic categories. Man-made structures often present the characteristic of symmetry. Based on this observation, we propose a symmetric regularizer for training the neural network. Our proposed method can make use of both the power of deep neural networks and the structure of man-made architectures. We also propose a method to refine the segmentation results using bounding boxes generated by the Region Proposal Network. We test our method by training a FCN-8s network with the novel loss function. Experimental results show that our method has outperformed previous state-of-the-art methods significantly on both the ECP dataset and the eTRIMS dataset. As far as we know, we are the first to employ end-to-end deep convolutional neural network on full image scale in the task of building facades parsing.",
          "An important part of art history can be discovered through the visual information in monument facades. However, the analysis of this visual information, i.e, morphology and architectural elements, requires high expert knowledge. An automatic system for identifying the architectural style or detecting the architectural elements of a monument based on one image will certainly help improving our knowledge in art and history. Building such tool is challenging as some styles share architectural elements, the bad conservation state of some monuments and the noise included in the image itself. The aim of this paper is to introduce MonuMAI (Monument with Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence) framework. In particular, (i) we designed MonuMAI dataset rich with expert knowledge considering the proposed architectural styles taxonomy and key elements relationship, which allows addressing several tasks, e.g., monument style classification and architectural elements detection, (ii) we developed MonuMAI deep learning pipeline based on lightweight MonuNet architecture for monument style classification and MonuMAI Key Elements Detection (MonuMAI-KED) model, and (iii) we built citizen science based MonuMAI mobile app that uses the proposed MonuMAI deep learning pipeline trained on MonuMAI dataset for performing in real life conditions. Our experiments show that both MonuNet architecture and the detection model achieve very good results under real life conditions.",
          "Rapid urbanization and global warming have increased heat stress in urban areas. This in turn makes using indoor space more compelling and leads to more energy consumption. Therefore, paying attention to outdoor spaces design with thermal comfort in mind becomes more important since outdoor spaces can host a variety of activities. This research aims to introduce a machine learning-based framework to predict the effects of different urban configurations (i.e. different greening configurations and types, different facade materials, and different urban geometry) on outdoor thermal comfort through training a pix2pix Convolutional generative adversarial network (cGAN) model. For the training of the machine learning model, a dataset consisting of 208 coupled pictures of input and output has been created. The simulation of this data has been carried out by ENVI-met. The resulting machine learning model had a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 96% on the test dataset with the highest SSIM of 97.08 and lowest of 94.43 which shows the high accuracy of the model and it could have reached an answer in 3 s compared to the 30-min average time for ENVI-met simulation. The resulting model shows great promise for assisting researchers and urban designers in studying existing urban contexts or planning new developments.",
          "Terrestrial Laser Scanners (TLS) are used to get dense point samples of large object's surface. TLS is new and efficient method to digitize large object or scene. The collected point samples come into different formats and coordinates. Different scans are required to scan large object such as heritage site. Point cloud registration is considered as important task to bring different scans into whole 3D model in one coordinate system. Point clouds can be registered by using one of the three ways or combination of them, Target based, feature extraction, point cloud based. For the present study we have gone through Point Cloud Based registration approach. We have collected partially overlapped 3D Point Cloud data of Department of Computer Science & IT (DCSIT) building located in Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, Aurangabad. To get the complete point cloud information of the building we have taken 12 scans, 4 scans for exterior and 8 scans for interior facade data collection. There are various algorithms available in literature, but Iterative Closest Point (ICP) is most dominant algorithms. The various researchers have developed variants of ICP for better registration process. The ICP point cloud registration algorithm is based on the search of pairs of nearest points in a two adjacent scans and calculates the transformation parameters between them, it provides advantage that no artificial target is required for registration process. We studied and implemented three variants Brute Force, KDTree, Partial Matching of ICP algorithm in MATLAB. The result shows that the implemented version of ICP algorithm with its variants gives better result with speed and accuracy of registration as compared with CloudCompare Open Source software.",
          "3D Building facade reconstruction enables the implementation of delicate actions related to restoration, support and presentation of architectural structures. In particular, model complexity can be significantly reduced through the incorporation of computer vision and image processing tools, aiming towards the estimation of structural 3D feature characteristics instead of their actual GPS specification. In this paper we present a strategy for constructing reduced-complexity 3D models, which combines stereo vision images and morphological processing methods. Initially, the building skeleton is extracted and modeled with the use of Hough transformation and Active Contours. Subsequently, the building's facade depth map is derived using the stereo camera layout, for the refinement of inner skeleton details, such as the protrusion of windows or doors. These image-driven features are fused with Georeferenced data in order to complete the full building's skeleton model. The proposed reconstruction framework is tested on the site of Neoria buildings, a historical (Venetian) site in Chania, Crete, Greece.",
          "The Architectural Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry can benefit from accurate building facade segmentation, which can provide valuable insights into building maintenance, urban planning, and security efforts. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors are effective in recognizing building facade components from (three-dimensional) 3D point clouds by regis-tering 3D spatial coordinates and radiometric information, which reveal the spectral property of a scanned surface. Although the radiometric information (i.e., intensity feature) can be used for segmentation, its accuracy may be reduced by factors such as scanning geometry and external factors that affect the object's radiometric information. To address this issue, this study proposes a robust and automated method for segmenting building facade components using LiDAR point cloud data and an empirical-based intensity correction model to ensure proper segmentation. The proposed method employs RandLA-Net, a deep learning model capable of effectively processing large-scale point cloud data, to classify building facade components based on their spatial features combined with corrected intensity features. By incorporating the proposed method into a digital twin, it is possible to perform accurate building facade segmentation and generate valuable insights into the building's physical condition, energy efficiency, and aesthetic value in real-time. The effectiveness of the proposed method was experimentally validated using a school building facade, which demonstrated significant improvements in the recognition of facade components and highlighted the potential of digital twin-enabled building facade segmentation for the AEC industry.",
          "This paper presents a data-driven workflow for the detection of scaffolding components from point clouds. The points belonging to the scaffolding components are identified and separated from the main building structures and two basic elements, namely the toeboard and the tube, are reconstructed. The workflow has four main processing steps. Firstly, the raw point clouds are preprocessed by statistical filtering and voxel girding. In the second step, the planar surfaces of the building surface and scaffoldings are extracted via RANSAC and then grouped by their parallelity and distance to separate the building facade. In the third step, the 3D shape descriptor FPFH and random forest classification algorithm are applied to classify the point data of building facades into classes belonging to different elements. Finally, by the use of linear fitting algorithm and matching using SHOT shape descriptor, the tubes and toeboards are reconstructed with their geometric parameters. It is shown that the points belonging to these objects are identified and then reconstructed with cylinder and cuboid models. The final results show that over 60% of the tubes and nearly 90% of the toeboards are reconstructed in the investigated facade, and more than 40% of the reconstructed objects are well rebuilt.",
          "The accurate classification of architectural styles is of great significance to the study of architectural culture and human historical civilization. Models based on convolutional neural network (CNN) have achieved highly competitive results in the field of architectural style classification owing to its more powerful capability of feature expression. However, most of the CNN models to date only extract the global features of architecture facade or focus on some regions of architecture and fail to extract the spatial features of different components. To improve the accuracy of architectural style classification, we propose an architectural style classification method based on CNN and channel-spatial attention. Firstly, we add a preprocessing operation before CNN feature extraction to select main building candidate region in architectural image and then use CNN feature extractor for deep feature extraction. Secondly, channel-spatial attention module is introduced to generate an attention map, which can not only enhance the texture feature representation of architectural images but also focus on the spatial features of different architectural elements. Finally, the Softmax classifier is used to predict the score of the target class. The experimental results on the Architectural Style Dataset and AHE_Dataset have achieved satisfactory performance.",
          "We propose a novel method for recognition of structured images and demonstrate it on detection of windows in facade images. Given an ability to obtain local low-level data evidence on primitive elements of a structure (like window in a facade image), we determine their most probable number, attribute values (location, size) and neighborhood relation. The embedded structure is weakly modeled by pair-wise attribute constraints, which allow structure and attribute constraints to mutually support each other. We use a very general framework of reversible jump MCMC, which allows simple implementation of a specific structure model and plug-in of almost arbitrary element classifiers. The MC controls the classifier by prescribing it where to look, without wasting too much time on unpromising locations. We have chosen the domain of window recognition in facade images to demonstrate that the result is an efficient algorithm achieving performance of other strongly informed methods for regular structures like grids, while our general model covers loosely regular configurations as well.",
          "Land typology classification is one of the main challenges of Land Registries all around the world. This process has historically been carried out by hand, requiring a large workforce and long processing times. Satellite imagery is shaking up the information retrieval methods for rural areas, where automatic algorithms have also been developed for land categorisation, but never for urban areas. This study provides an algorithm which can potentially speed up the decision-making process, reduce and detect biases; by automatically classifying images of houses facades into land registry categories. Convolutional Neural Networks are combined with a SVM and trained with over 5,000 labelled images. Success rate is above 85% and single image processing time is of the order of milliseconds. Results make it possible to reduce operating costs and to improve the classification performance by taking the human factor out of the equation.",
          "Nowadays, with the development of the urban areas, the automatic reconstruction of the buildings, as an important objects of the city complex structures, became a challenging topic in computer vision and photogrammetric researches. In this paper, the capability of multi-view Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) images is examined to provide a 3D model of complex building facades using an efficient image-based modelling workflow. The main steps of this work include: pose estimation, point cloud generation, and 3D modelling. After improving the initial values of interior and exterior parameters at first step, an efficient image matching technique such as Semi Global Matching (SGM) is applied on UAV images and a dense point cloud is generated. Then, a mesh model of points is calculated using Delaunay 2.5D triangulation and refined to obtain an accurate model of building. Finally, a texture is assigned to mesh in order to create a realistic 3D model. The resulting model has provided enough details of building based on visual assessment.",
          "Energy consumption simulation and renovation of existing buildings require accurate acquisition of building facade features which mostly relies on time-consuming manual calculations based on architectural drawings. In this article, we proposed an automated deep learning-based approach based on the SE module and BiFPN to achieve precise and efficient facade feature extraction. The approach eliminated the image distortion of building facades and then enabled accurate segmentation of windows and accessory structures even under the situation of occlusion and reflection. The improved SOLOv2 algorithm resulted in a high mean average precision of 93% for window segmentation, leading to a more precise window-to-wall ratio estimation with a mean absolute error of 2.9% than the experts' estimation and existing deep learning-based methods. Considering the accurate results of facade parsing, our method can be utilized for city-level building feature extraction, providing theoretical and practical references for urban building energy simulation, urban renewal, and building health examination.",
          "Abandoned houses (AH) are focal points in urban communities by threatening local security, destroying housing markets, and burdening government finance in the U.S. legacy cities. In particular, individual-level AH detection provides essential information for fine-resolution urban studies, government decision-makers, and private sector practitioners. However, three primary conventional data sources (field data, utility data, and remote sensing data) cannot suffice to collect such fine-resolution data in the large spatial area via a cost-effective approach. To this end, Google Street View (GSV) imagery, which emerges as the mainstream open-access data source with global coverage, provides an opportunity to address this issue. Subsequently, a follow-up challenge confronting the detection of AH arises from the fact that it lacks an effective method that can discern authentic visual features from the redundant noise in GSV images. In this study, we aim to develop an effective method to detect individual-level AH from GSV imagery. Specifically, we developed a new hierarchical deep learning method to leverage both global and local visual features of AH in the detection. The method can be further divided into three steps: (1) Scene-based classification that can extract global visual features of AH was implemented through fine-tuning a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model. (2) We developed a patch-based classification method that can extract specific local features of AH. In this method, patches were generated from GSV images based on auto-detected local features, followed by being labeled as three categories: building patches, vegetation patches, and others. Two deep CNN models were employed to identify deteriorated building facade patches and overgrown vegetation patches, respectively. (3) Individual-level AH were detected by integrating scene classification results and patch classification results in a decision-tree model. Experimental results showed that the F-score of AH was 0.84 in a well-prepared dataset collected from five different Rust Belt cities. The proposed hierarchical deep learning approach effectively improved the accuracy comparing with the traditional scene-based method. In addition, the proposed method was applied to generate an AH map in a new site in Detroit, MI. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of GSV imagery in AH detection and showed great potential to detect AH in a large spatial extent.",
          "This paper describes a pipeline for automatically generating level of detail (LOD) models (digital twins), specifically LOD2 and LOD3, from free-standing buildings. Our approach combines structure from motion (SfM) with deep-learning-based segmentation techniques. Given multiple-view images of a building, we compute a three-dimensional (3D) planar abstraction (LOD2 model) of its point cloud using SfM techniques. To obtain LOD3 models, we use deep learning to perform semantic segmentation of the openings in the two-dimensional (2D) images. Unlike existing approaches, we do not rely on complex input, pre-defined 3D shapes or manual intervention. To demonstrate the robustness of our method, we show that it can generate 3D building shapes from a collection of building images with no further input. For evaluating reconstructions, we also propose two novel metrics. The first is a Euclidean-distance-based correlation of the 3D building model with the point cloud. The second involves re-projecting 3D model facades onto source photos to determine dice scores with respect to the ground-truth masks. Finally, we make the code, the image datasets, SfM outputs, and digital twins reported in this work publicly available in github.com/eesd-epfl/LOD3_buildings and doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6651663. With this work we aim to contribute research in applications such as construction management, city planning, and mechanical analysis, among others.",
          "Existing image inpainting algorithms have achieved good results in regular mask inpainting tasks, but there are still many limitations for irregular mask, and the inpainting results lack edge consistency and semantic correctness. To address these problems, we designed a progressive generative adversarial network in this paper. The generative network mainly contains a progressive feature generation module and an adaptive consistent attention module, and the discriminator network uses SN-PatchGAN. The network performs recursive inpainting from the edge to the centre, and the repaired features are used as the conditions for the next feature generation, which makes the constraints of the central content gradually strengthened. In order to obtain distant information from the feature maps as well as to consider the possible problem of inconsistency between feature mappings under different recursions when using attention directly in the progressive inpainting network, we designed an adaptive consistent attention module in this paper, which can adaptively combine scores obtained from different recursions to capture more feature information. The discriminator used in this paper is SN-PatchGAN, which directly calculates the hinge loss of each point on the output graph and can focus on different locations as well as different semantics. Comparing this paper's method on CelebA dataset and CMP Facade dataset with the latest work, the experimental results show that this paper's method performs well in the irregular mask image inpainting task, and the inpainting results have better performance in terms of edge consistency, semantic correctness, and overall image structure.",
          "Building recognition in urban environments aims to identify different buildings in a large-scale image dataset. This identification facilitates the annotation of any visual object to a building's facade and is an essential step in a variety of applications, such as automatic target detection in surveillance, real-time robot localization and visual navigation, architectural design, and 3D city reconstruction. Because of its importance, a significant number of building recognition systems have been proposed in recent years. Nevertheless, there is no systematic survey of building recognition in urban environments yet. To this end, we present a comprehensive review of the dominant building recognition systems by first grouping them into two categories: (i) effectiveness approaches that mainly focus on the improvement of recognition performance and (ii) efficiency methods that attempt to enhance the recognition speed. Effectiveness approaches are further categorized into two different groups: (i) feature representation-based algorithms and (ii) wide baseline matching-based methods. Efficiency methods are divided into: (i) dimensionality reduction-based methods and (ii) clustering-based algorithms. We provide analysis and discussions on each type of method and summarize their, advantages and weaknesses in depth. Furthermore, we outline future research directions and associated challenges in this promising area. This survey can serve as a starting point for new researchers in building recognition to generate new ideas according to their specific requirements. ",
          "Extracting facade maps from 3D point clouds is a fast and economical way to describe a building's surface structure. Existing methods lack efficiency, robustness, and accuracy, and depend on many additional features such as point cloud reflectivity and color. This paper proposes a robust and automatic method to extract building facade maps. First, an improved 3D Hough transform is proposed by adding shift vote and 3D convolution of the accumulator to improve computational efficiency and reduce peak fuzziness and dependence on the step selection. These modifications make the extraction of potential planes fast and accurate. Second, the coplane and vertical plane constraints are introduced to eliminate pseudoplanes and nonbuilding facades. Then, we propose a strategy to refine the potential facade and to achieve the accurate calibration and division of the adjacent facade boundaries by clustering the refined point clouds of the facade. This process solves the problem where adjoining surfaces are merged into the same surface in the traditional method. Finally, the extracted facade point clouds are converted into feature images. Doors, windows, and building edges are accurately extracted via deep learning and digital image processing techniques, which combine to achieve accurate extraction of building facades. The proposed method was tested on the MLS and TLS point cloud datasets, which were collected from different cities with different building styles. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method decreases computational burden, improves efficiency, and achieves the accurate differentiation of adjacent facade boundaries with higher accuracy compared with the traditional method, verifying the robustness of the method. Additionally, the proposed method uses only point cloud geometry information, effectively reducing data requirements and acquisition costs.",
          "Creating a virtual city is demanded for computer games, movies, and urban planning, but it takes a lot of time to create numerous 3D building models. Procedural modeling has become popular in recent years to overcome this issue, but creating a grammar to get a desired output is difficult and time consuming even for expert users. In this paper, we present an interactive tool that allows users to automatically generate such a grammar from a single image of a building. The user selects a photograph and highlights the silhouette of the target building as input to our method. Our pipeline automatically generates the building components, from large-scale building mass to fine-scale windows and doors geometry. Each stage of our pipeline combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and optimization to select and parameterize procedural grammars that reproduce the building elements of the picture. In the first stage, our method jointly estimates camera parameters and building mass shape. Once known, the building mass enables the rectification of the facades, which are given as input to the second stage that recovers the facade layout. This layout allows us to extract individual windows and doors that are subsequently fed to the last stage of the pipeline that selects procedural grammars for windows and doors. Finally, the grammars are combined to generate a complete procedural building as output. We devise a common methodology to make each stage of this pipeline tractable. This methodology consists in simplifying the input image to match the visual appearance of synthetic training data, and in using optimization to refine the parameters estimated by CNNs. We used our method to generate a variety of procedural models of buildings from existing photographs.",
          "Automatic object removal with obstructed facades completion in the urban environment is essential for many applications such as scene restoration, environmental impact assessment, and urban mapping. However, the previous object removal typically requires a user to manually create a mask around unwanted objects and obtain background facade information in advance, which would be labor-intensive when implementing multitasking projects. Moreover, accurately detecting objects to be removed in the cityscape and inpainting the static obstructed building facade to obtain plausible images are the main challenges for this objective. To overcome these difficulties, this study addresses the object removal with the facade inpainting problem from the following two aspects. First, we proposed an image-based cityscape elimination method for automatic object removal and facade inpainting by applying semantic segmentation to detect several classes, including pedestrians, riders, vegetation, and cars, as well as using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for filling detected regions by background textures and patching information from street-level imagery. Second, we proposed a workflow to filter unoccluded building facades from street view images automatically and tailored a dataset for the GAN-based image inpainting model with original and mask images. Furthermore, several full-reference image quality assessment (IQA) metrics are introduced to evaluate the generated image quality. Validation results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed method, and the synthetic image is visually realistic and semantically consistent.",
          "With the development of society and the economy, the unified planning of architectural styles has become a significant problem in the balance between urban expansion and the protection of traditional buildings in villages and towns. This also allows people to re-examine the appearance of and quality of life, experienced by those in traditional village buildings. This research employs a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to develop a generative technique for designing building facades in villages and cities. The provided results can be used to develop schemes and as design references for building facade design, enhancing the design efficiency of building facades. Simultaneously, we utilized this model for the rehabilitation of building facades in villages and towns, as well as in the visual design of rural tourism products, demonstrating its practical usefulness and design-related potential. We took villages and towns in the Wuyishan area of China as an example and carried out model training, image generation, and a comparison of the derivation results of different assumed buildings and product contours. The research shows that: (1) CGAN can be used to produce and supply reference schemes for conventional civil construction facade design in rural and urban areas. (2) In terms of adaptability, CGAN may develop architectural facade design schemes with a reference value for the hypothetical experimental building facades, and it can play a role in other design domains, as well. (3) The construction of this method is not only applicable to villages and towns in the World Heritage es Cities Programme, but can be further promoted and used in the future for cities and villages that have a demand for architectural style consistency.",
          "This paper deals with the task of semantic segmentation, which aims to provide a complete description of an image by inferring a pixelwise labeling. While pixelwise classification is a suitable approach to achieve this goal, state-of-the-art kernel methods are generally not applicable since training and testing phase involve large amounts of data. We address this problem by presenting a method for large-scale inference with Gaussian processes. Standard limitations of Gaussian process classifiers in terms of speed and memory are overcome by pre-clustering the data using decision trees. This leads to a breakdown of the entire problem into several independent classification tasks whose complexity is controlled by the maximum number of training examples allowed in the tree leaves. We additionally propose a technique which allows for computing multi-class probabilities by incorporating uncertainties of the classifier estimates. The approach provides pixelwise semantics for a wide range of applications and different image types such as those from scene understanding, defect localization, and remote sensing. Our experiments are performed with a facade recognition application that shows the significant performance gain achieved by our method compared to previous approaches.",
          "Building usage maps are inputs in various urban applications. Although Street View Images (SVIs) are applied in many studies, their usage in the generation of building usage maps is limited. Further, their application to Indian cities remains void. This research aims to fill the discussed gaps by employing geotagged SVIs through web scraping, Google Street View (GSV), and manual collection. Manually collected data from mobile phone and web-scraped images also cover the dense regions, which are generally not covered in GSV. Hence, it helps the generation of accurate maps. We first applied a pretrained Inception-ResNet-v2 model to detect the building instances from training images of various Indian cities. The extracted building instances were manually labeled as different usage class (residential, commercial, industrial, and others) to develop the classification training set. EfficientNet-B7, a Deep Learning (DL) model leveraged the facade features in the training process to predict the usage class of the building instances. The model achieved an accuracy of 81% on training and 77% on test sets. The predictions were attributed with building footprint using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to prepare building usage maps for various cities in India. Although the model faced challenges in predicting a lot of buildings with similar facade, we still found it to be robust in predicting the usage of buildings across various geography. The study can act as a decision-making tool in various smart applications that require high-resolution building-use data, which can help developing sustainable cities.",
          "Using ground-based, remote hyperspectral images from 0.4-1.0 micron in similar to 850 spectral channels-acquired with the Urban Observatory facility in New York City-we evaluate the use of one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for pixel-level classification and segmentation of built and natural materials in urban environments. We find that a multi-class model trained on hand-labeled pixels containing Sky, Clouds, Vegetation, Water, Building facades, Windows, Roads, Cars, and Metal structures yields an accuracy of 90-97% for three different scenes. We assess the transferability of this model by training on one scene and testing to another with significantly different illumination conditions and/or different content. This results in a significant (similar to 45%) decrease in the model precision and recall as does training on all scenes at once and testing on the individual scenes. These results suggest that while CNNs are powerful tools for pixel-level classification of very high-resolution spectral data of urban environments, retraining between scenes may be necessary. Furthermore, we test the dependence of the model on several instrument- and data-specific parameters including reduced spectral resolution (down to 15 spectral channels) and number of available training instances. The results are strongly class-dependent; however, we find that the classification of natural materials is particularly robust, especially the Vegetation class with a precision and recall >94% for all scenes and model transfers and >90% with only a single training instance.",
          "Building reconstruction using high-resolution satellite-based synthetic SAR tomography (TomoSAR) is of great importance in urban planning and city modeling applications. However, since the imaging mode of SAR is side-by-side, the TomoSAR point cloud of a single orbit cannot achieve a complete observation of buildings. It is difficult for existing methods to extract the same features, as well as to use the overlap rate to achieve the alignment of the homologous TomoSAR point cloud and the cross-source TomoSAR point cloud. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust alignment method for TomoSAR point clouds in urban areas. First, noise points and outlier points are filtered by statistical filtering, and density of projection point (DoPP)-based projection is used to extract TomoSAR building point clouds and obtain the facade points for subsequent calculations based on density clustering. Subsequently, coarse alignment of source and target point clouds was performed using principal component analysis (PCA). Lastly, the rotation and translation coefficients were calculated using the angle of the normal vector of the opposite facade of the building and the distance of the outer end of the facade projection. The experimental results verify the feasibility and robustness of the proposed method. For the homologous TomoSAR point cloud, the experimental results show that the average rotation error of the proposed method was less than 0.1 degrees, and the average translation error was less than 0.25 m. The alignment accuracy of the cross-source TomoSAR point cloud was evaluated for the defined angle and distance, whose values were less than 0.2 degrees and 0.25 m.",
          "Land-use classification based on spaceborne or aerial remote sensing images has been extensively studied over the past decades. Such classification is usually a patch-wise or pixel-wise labeling over the whole image. But for many applications, such as urban population density mapping or urban utility planning, a classification map based on individual buildings is much more informative. However, such semantic classification still poses some fundamental challenges, for example, how to retrieve fine boundaries of individual buildings. In this paper, we proposed a general framework for classifying the functionality of individual buildings. The proposed method is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which classify facade structures from street view images, such as Google Street View, in addition to remote sensing images which usually only show roof structures. Geographic information was utilized to mask out individual buildings, and to associate the corresponding street view images. We created a benchmark dataset which was used for training and evaluating CNNs. In addition, the method was applied to generate building classification maps on both region and city scales of several cities in Canada and the US.",
          "The objective of this work is a robust and highly efficient method for reconstruction and classification of facade parts in 3D point clouds. The presented top-down method is based on knowledge derived from a database of ground truth parameters. The usage of prior information is the key feature of our concept. It enables a robust and quick computation that even copes with a high percentage of outliers. Model knowledge is encoded in probability density functions. Furthermore, we combine random sampling with a novel scoring function that rates the size of predictions. Decision trees were applied to identify the most evident features that are assessed by the scoring function. Finally, cluster analysis is employed to estimate those borders of the respective object that cannot be identified precisely by the parametric model. Since the reconstruction of geometric models from a 3D point cloud is close to its classification, both problems are linked up by the presented concept. Our method works on non-oriented point clouds and is free of user interaction. The concept is delineated and demonstrated by the reconstruction of windows and stairs.",
          "Windows, as key components of building facades, have received increasing attention in facade parsing. Convolutional neural networks have shown promising results in window extraction. Most existing methods segment a facade into semantic categories and subsequently employ regularization based on the structure of manmade architectures. These methods merely concern the optimization of individual windows, without considering the spatial areas or relationships of windows. This paper presents a novel windows instance segmentation method based on Mask R-CNN architecture. The method features a spatial attention region proposal network and a relation module-enhanced head network. First, an attention module is introduced in the region proposal network to generate a spatial attention map, then the attention map is multiplied with the objectness scores of the classification branch. Second, for the head network, relation modules are added to model the spatial relationships between proposals. Appearance and geometric features are combined for instance recognition. Furthermore, we constructed a new window instance segmentation dataset with 1200 annotated images. With our dataset, the average precisions of our method on detection and segmentation increased from 53.1% and 53.7% to 56.4% and 56.7% compared with Mask R-CNN. A comparison with state-of-the-art methods also proves the predominance of our proposed method.",
          "Building facade detection is an important problem in computer vision, with applications in mobile robotics and semantic scene understanding. In particular, mobile platform localization and guidance in urban environments can be enabled with an accurate segmentation of the various building facades in a scene. Toward that end, we present a system for segmenting and labeling an input image that for each pixel, seeks to answer the question Is this pixel part of a building facade, and if so, which one? The proposed method determines a set of candidate planes by sampling and clustering points from the image with Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), using local normal estimates derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to inform the planar model. The corresponding disparity map and a discriminative classification provide prior information for a two-layer Markov Random Field model. This MRF problem is solved via Graph Cuts to obtain a labeling of building facade pixels at the mid-level, and a segmentation of those pixels into particular planes at the high-level. The results indicate a strong improvement in the accuracy of the binary building detection problem over the discriminative classifier alone, and the planar surface estimates provide a good approximation to the ground truth planes.",
          "In recent years, advances in computer hardware, graphics rendering algorithms and computer vision have enabled the utilization of 3D building reconstructions in the fields of archeological structure restoration and urban planning. This paper deals with the reconstruction of realistic 3D models of buildings facades, in the urban environment for cultural heritage. The proposed approach is an extension of our previous work in this research topic, which introduced a methodology for accurate 3D realistic facade reconstruction by defining and exploiting a relation between stereoscopic image and tacheometry data. In this work, we re-purpose well known deep neural network architectures in the fields of image segmentation and single image depth prediction, for the tasks of facade structural element detection, depth point-cloud generation and protrusion estimation, with the goal of alleviating drawbacks in our previous design, resulting in a more light-weight, robust, flexible and cost-effective design.",
          "Buildings account for 40% of the energy consumption and 13% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the U.S. To improve building energy efficiency, cities around the U.S. issued energy policies, such as the energy performance disclosure requirement in New York City, to encourage building owners to make informed retrofitting decisions. However, complying with these policies is expensive and time-consuming for government agencies and building owners, especially for old buildings where detailed building information is not readily available. In this work, we propose an automatic, non-intrusive, and scalable framework to capture energy-essential building variables through reasoning building facade images -FacadeReasoner. Specifically, we first build a comprehensive building information dataset and identify the most impactful (i.e., principal) variables in relation to building energy performance and GHG emissions using the state-of-the-art feature attribution model. Next, we propose a method to automatically collect an urban scale building image dataset with more than 10,000 facade images and extract principal-building-variables from these images using deep transfer learning. Results show that FacadeReasoner has the capability to predict principal building variables, namely building type (accuracy 0.77), year built (accuracy 0.62), building height (R2 0.80), and rough estimates of building area (R2 0.46) from facade images. This study is unique as it marks the first attempt to enable an automated end-to-end framework for urban scale principal-building-variables extraction, providing an efficient and economical alternative for large building portfolio owners and managers (e.g., municipalities) to comprehend urban scale energy-related building information for informed decision-making, directly contributing to Net-Zero 2050.",
          "There is a huge gap between the conceptual design and the practical implementation of the conservation planning of traditional architecture and settlement in China. The major cause is the diversity of individual comprehension. In this study, a generative design method was developed to regenerate the facades. The proposed method first adapted novel data acquisition and processing techniques to gather information and build the database. Cognition investigation and morphology analysis were then implemented to quantify and evaluate the features of historical characteristics. The knowledge discovery tools were further used to abstract the rules of the traditional facade. With the above three phases, the proposed method was able to generate the referable facades quantitatively and establishing generally accepted conservation plans and guidelines.",
          "Rephotography is the process of recapturing the photograph of a location from the same perspective in which it was captured earlier. A rephotographed image is the best presentation to visualize and study the social changes of a location over time. Traditionally, only expert artists and photographers are capable of generating the rephotograph of any specific location. Manual editing or human eye judgment that is considered for generating rephotographs normally requires a lot of precision, effort and is not always accurate. In the era of computer science and deep learning, computer vision techniques make it easier and faster to perform precise operations to an image. Until now many research methodologies have been proposed for rephotography but none of them is fully automatic. Some of these techniques require manual input by the user or need multiple images of the same location with 3D point cloud data while others are only suggestions to the user to perform rephotography. In historical records/archives most of the time we can find only one 2D image of a certain location. Computational rephotography is a challenge in the case of using only one image of a location captured at different timestamps because it is difficult to find the accurate perspective of a single 2D historical image. Moreover, in the case of building rephotography, it is required to maintain the alignments and regular shape. The features of a building may change over time and in most of the cases, it is not possible to use a features detection algorithm to detect the key features. In this research paper, we propose a methodology to rephotograph house images by combining deep learning and traditional computer vision techniques. The purpose of this research is to rephotograph an image of the past based on a single image. This research will be helpful not only for computer scientists but also for history and cultural heritage research scholars to study the social changes of a location during a specific time period, and it will allow users to go back in time to see how a specific place looked in the past. We have achieved good, fully automatic rephotographed results based on facade segmentation using only a single image.",
          "To solve the problems of blur, artifacts, and semantic inaccuracy of existing deep learning-based image inpainting algorithm when the large-area irregular defect area images are repaired, combining the U-NET architecture and the idea of a generative adversarial network, a generative image inpainting network based on the attention transfer cross layer mechanism is proposed. The network is divided into two parts: generator and discriminator; the generator proposes a attention transfer network cross layer based on the U-NET architecture; after the input image is encoded, the attention transfer network cross layer is used to reconstruct the encoding feature map of each layer. The decoding is performed by fusing the skip connection with the corresponding potential feature in the multi-scale decoder, solving the information loss between the codec network layers. Moreover, each decoding layer of the multi-scale decoder is prompted to generate consistent content, and finally the repaired image is obtained. After the decoding is completed, the decoding feature map of each layer is converted into a multi-scale RGB image, and the reconstruction L1 loss is applied on each scale; by minimizing the adversarial loss, the discriminator can determine the authenticity of the repaired image; the perceptual loss and style loss are introduced to judge the output image, so as to restrict the generator to generate more realistic and reasonable content. A qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis is performed on the Celeba, Facade, and Places2 with the current mainstream image inpainting algorithms. The results show that the repair results in this paper are better than others in terms of mean L1 loss, PSNR, and SSIM, and more in line with human visual characteristics. The attention transfer network cross layer proposed in this paper can effectively reconstruct the more detailed coding feature map, and it can play an active guiding role in the coding process by using skip connection; the image inpainting network can generate content that is highly consistent with the structure and semantics of the real image when repairing large-area irregular defect areas, which is more in line with the human visual experience.",
          "Feature extraction on facades from unstructured point clouds is a challenging work, especially in the presence of noise. Point cloud segmentation is one of the most important steps in this context. In this paper, a new approach for automatic processing of facade laser scanner data is introduced. Scanner orientation is partially known through the inclination sensors of the laser scanner used. Knowing these values allows us to reduce the point cloud data into a profile distribution function. After orientation, this distribution is a series of peaks and valleys suitable for segmentation. Each segmented layer is afterwards processed to find the facade contours. The results obtained prove that the approach may be successfully employed in building segmentation and extraction of planar features. Moreover, the accuracy of contours is very dependent on the resolution of the scan data. ",
          "Surface normal estimation is an essential component of several computer and robot vision pipelines. While this problem has been extensively studied, most approaches are geared towards indoor scenes and often rely on multiple modalities (depth, multiple views) for accurate estimation of normal maps. Outdoor scenes pose a greater challenge as they exhibit significant lighting variation, often contain occluders, and structures like building facades are often ridden with numerous windows and protrusions. Conventional supervised learning schemes excel in indoor scenes, but do not exhibit competitive performance when trained and deployed in outdoor environments. Furthermore, they involve complex network architectures and require many more trainable parameters. To tackle these challenges, we present an adversarial learning scheme that regularizes the output normal maps from a neural network to appear more realistic, by using a small number of precisely annotated examples. Our method presents a lightweight and simpler architecture, while improving performance by at least 1.5x across most metrics. We evaluate our approaches against the state-of-the-art on normal map estimation, on a synthetic and a real outdoor dataset, and observe significant performance enhancements.",
          "3D reconstruction from single view is a very difficult problem in computer vision and computer graphics. Few works have been done in this area. In this paper, we proposed a method to discover structural regularity in single facade images on the procedural modeling of buildings by using SIFT algorithm. Firstly, symmetry information is detected from the image using SIFT algorithm for image analysis. Next, the symmetry information will be removed from the facade image. Finally, get the SIFT feature of widows and doors. Experiments show that our method can successfully discover regular structures with a higher recognition rate than existing method especially amidst shadowing and the changing illumination environment.",
          "Distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) harvesting is an effective way to collect solar energy in existing metropoli-tan cities. To facilitate the installation of PV modules at solar abundant locations, an accurate estimation of solar PV spatial potential is indispensable. Solar energy could be reflected on high-albedo building surfaces inside the urban canyon. However, using conventional ways to construct albedo datasets for different building surfaces is extremely labor-intense. In this work, we proposed to use semantic segmentation to identify facade materials from street view images. Due to the distinguishable features between materials in terms of the subtle texture and patterns rather than just their shapes and colors, identification requires more details from images, which makes multi-scale inference structure a promising solution. Compared with existing methods combining scales features at pixel-level, we proposed a novel Multi-Scale Contextual Attention Network (MSCA), using a Multi-Scale Object-Contextual Representation (OCR) block to exploit and combine contextual information from different scales in high dimensional layers. The experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing models, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIOU) of 70.23%. The results indicate that the MSCA can effectively obtain the materials information from street views and can be a reliable solution to providing urban albedo information for solar estimation.",
          "Due to high point density, accuracy and cost-effectiveness, Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) do have the great advantage of providing the details of building facade as required for the production of realistic 3D city models. Thus, a significant amount of research efforts has been directed towards reconstructing building facade models using TLS data. Most of reconstruction strategies are based on geometric feature extraction, which is categorized into two groups: point-based and segmentation-based boundary extraction. However, little attention was paid on further recognizing and separating those extracted geometric features, result of which is helpful for 3D building modeling at LOD3. This paper presents an approach to recognize 3D facade features automatically from TSL data based on heuristic knowledge of geometrical and topological configuration of facade objects. All the facade knowledge is stored in a hierarchical tree, which guides the classification process. Finally, a confusion matrix is created to evaluate the classification performance.",
          "Urban environments are regions in which spectral variability and spatial variability are extremely high, with a huge range of shapes and sizes, and they also demand high resolution images for applications involving their study. Due to the fact that these environments can grow even more over time, applications related to their monitoring tend to turn to autonomous intelligent systems, which together with remote sensing data could help or even predict daily life situations. The task of mapping cities by autonomous operators was usually carried out by aerial optical images due to its scale and resolution; however new scientific questions have arisen, and this has led research into a new era of highly-detailed data extraction. For many years, using artificial neural models to solve complex problems such as automatic image classification was commonplace, owing much of their popularity to their ability to adapt to complex situations without needing human intervention. In spite of that, their popularity declined in the mid-2000s, mostly due to the complex and time-consuming nature of their methods and workflows. However, newer neural network architectures have brought back the interest in their application for autonomous classifiers, especially for image classification purposes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been a trend for pixel-wise image segmentation, showing flexibility when detecting and classifying any kind of object, even in situations where humans failed to perceive differences, such as in city scenarios. In this paper, we aim to explore and experiment with state-of-the-art technologies to semantically label 3D urban models over complex scenarios. To achieve these goals, we split the problem into two main processing lines: first, how to correctly label the facade features in the 2D domain, where a supervised CNN is used to segment ground-based facade images into six feature classes, roof, window, wall, door, balcony and shop; second, a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) workflow is used to extract the geometry of the facade, wherein the segmented images in the previous stage are then used to label the generated mesh by a reverse ray-tracing technique. This paper demonstrates that the proposed methodology is robust in complex scenarios. The facade feature inferences have reached up to 93% accuracy over most of the datasets used. Although it still presents some deficiencies in unknown architectural styles and needs some improvements to be made regarding 3D-labeling, we present a consistent and simple methodology to handle the problem.",
          "Building facades elements detection plays a key point role in facade defects detection and street scene recon-struction tasks for sustainable city development. Although the artificial intelligence technology has made a breakthrough in image segmentation, it is nontrivial to directly apply standard deep learning approaches for building facade element detection. The main reason is that the existing semantic segmentation networks have a bad performance in predicting highly regularized shapes. This research develops a hieratical deep learning framework with a symmetric loss function to automatically detect building facade elements from images. The new framework contains two types of attention modules, namely, the spatial attention module, and the channel attention module. A new loss function is designed to integrate prior engineering knowledge, which can be used to force the detection of facade elements (e.g., windows, doors, concrete walls, and sunshades) to have a highly proportionate shape. The effectiveness of the developed approach is demonstrated in two public datasets. Experimental results indicate that the developed deep learning framework with a new loss function outperforms state-of-the-art models significantly, where the achieved a Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) on the Ecole Centrale Paris(ECP) dataset (81.9%) brings an improvement of 11.3% over Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and 4.0% over Deepfacade, respectively, and the achieved a Mean IoU on the ArtDeco dataset (85.6%) yields an improvement of 11.4% over FCN and 5.8% over Deepfacade, respectively. Moreover, the developed approach is more practical and effective to detect regularized facade elements, where the detection of the wall components has an IoU of 93.6% on the ECP dataset and 88.6% on the ArtDeco dataset, respectively. Overall, the contribution from the technical aspect is to develop a hieratical deep learning framework consisting of attention modules together with the newly designed loss function and the prior engineering knowledge. The contribution from the practical aspect is to realize the automatic and accurate detection for various building facade elements in complex environments, which can be potentially helpful for the infrastructure monitoring and maintenance operation.",
          "In this paper, we use shape grammars (SGs) for facade parsing, which amounts to segmenting 2D building facades into balconies, walls, windows, and doors in an architecturally meaningful manner. The main thrust of our work is the introduction of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to deal with the computational complexity of the problem. RL provides us with techniques such as Q-learning and state aggregation which we exploit to efficiently solve facade parsing. We initially phrase the 1D parsing problem in terms of a Markov Decision Process, paving the way for the application of RL-based tools. We then develop novel techniques for the 2D shape parsing problem that take into account the specificities of the facade parsing problem. Specifically, we use state aggregation to enforce the symmetry of facade floors and demonstrate how to use RL to exploit bottom-up, image-based guidance during optimization. We provide systematic results on the Paris building dataset and obtain state-of-the-art results in a fraction of the time required by previous methods. We validate our method under diverse imaging conditions and make our software and results available online.",
          "Advances in three-dimensional (3D) acquisition systems have introduced this technology to more fields of study, such as archaeology or architecture. In the architectural field, scanning a building is one of the first possible steps from which a 3D model can be obtained and can be later used for visualisation and/or feature analysis, thanks to computer-based pattern recognition tools. The automation of these tools allows for temporal savings and has become a strong aid for professionals, so that more and more methods are developed with this objective. In this article, a method for 3D mesh segmentation focused on the representation of historic buildings is proposed. This type of buildings is characterised by having singularities and features in facades, such as doors or windows. The main objective is to recognise these features, understanding them as those parts of the model that differ from the main structure of the building. The idea is to use a recognition algorithm for planar faces that allows users to create a graph showing the connectivity between them, therefore allowing the reflection of the shape of the 3D model. At a later step, this graph is matched against some pre-defined graphs that represent the patterns to look for. Each coincidence between both graphs indicate the position of one of the characteristics sought. The developed method has proved to be effective for feature detection and suitable for inclusion in architectural surveying applications.",
          "This study proposes a method to recognize facades from large-scale urban scenes based on multi-level image features utilizing a recently developed oblique aerial photogrammetry technique. The method involves the use of multi-level image features, a bottom-up feature extraction procedure to produce regions of interest through monoscopic analysis, and then a coarse-to-fine feature matching strategy to characterise and match the regions in a stereoscopic model. Feature extraction from typical urban Manhattan scenes is based on line segments. Windows are re-organised based on the spatial constraints of line segments and the homogeneous structure of the spectrum. Facades as regions of interest are successfully constructed with a remarkable single edge and evidence from windows to get rid of occlusion. Feature matching is hierarchically performed beginning from distinctive facades and regularly distributed windows to the sub-pixel point primitives. The proposed strategy can effectively solve ambiguity and multi-solution problems in the complex urban scene matching process, particularly repetitive and poor-texture facades in oblique view.",
          "Although the Korean government has provided high-quality architectural building information for a long period of time, its focus on administrative details over three-dimensional (3D) architectural mapping and data collection has hindered progress. This study presents a basic method for extracting exterior building information for the purpose of 3D mapping using deep learning and digital image processing. The method identifies and classifies objects by using the fast regional convolutional neural network model. The results show an accuracy of 93% in the detection of facade and 91% window detection; this could be further improved by more clearly defining the boundaries of windows and reducing data noise. The additional metadata provided by the proposed method could, in the future, be included in building information modeling databases to facilitate structural analyses or reconstruction efforts.",
          "The automatic interpretation of 3D point clouds for building reconstruction is a challenging task. The interpretation process requires highly structured models representing semantics. Formal grammars can describe structures as well as the parameters of buildings and their parts. We propose a novel approach for the automatic learning of weighted attributed context-free grammar rules for 3D building reconstruction, supporting the laborious manual design of rules. We separate structure from parameter learning. Specific Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used to generate a weighted context-free grammar and predict structured outputs such as parse trees. The grammar is extended by parameters and constraints, which are learned based on a statistical relational learning method using Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). MLNs enforce the topological and geometric constraints. MLNs address uncertainty explicitly and provide probabilistic inference. They are able to deal with partial observations caused by occlusions. Uncertain projective geometry is used to deal with the uncertainty of the observations. Learning is based on a large building database covering different building styles and facade structures. In particular, a treebank that has been derived from the database is employed for structure learning.",
          "A major application area for Augmented Reality (AR) is advertisement. To achieve easy advertisement integration and management for stakeholders, a quantitative semantic understanding of the world, that adheres to human perception is necessary. Current deep learning-based segmentation algorithms such as Mask R-CNN provide a mask of the real world (e.g. building facades) in a greedy manner, which, although quantitatively accurate, does not adhere to the needs of the AR advertisers for appropriate ad placement, such as ad size, mask continuity, etc. In this paper, we propose three intuitive metrics for evaluating building facade segmentation specifically for advertisement integration, namely, average discontinuity, normalized continuous area, and resolution ratio. Each of these metrics is inspired from the way advertisers may want to view segmentation results within an AR world editor, or the way users may want to experience AR advertisements. Experimental results on a test segmentation shows the importance of such intuitive metrics, where we show how an accurate placement area for a sample 2D advertisement can be easily isolated from a segmented facade using our metrics.",
          "In the past few years, street-level geoviewers has become a. very popular web-application. In this paper, we focus on a, first urban concept which has been identified as useful for indexing then retrieving a building or a. location in a city: the windows. The work can be divided into three successive processes: first, object detection, then object characterization, finally similarity function design (kernel design). Contours seem intuitively relevant to hold architecture information from building facades. We first provide a robust window detector for our unconstrained data, present some results and compare our method with the reference one. Then; we represent objects by fragments of contours and a relational graph on these contour fragments. We design a kernel similarity function for structured sets of contours which will take into account the variations of contour orientation inside the structure set as well as spatial proximity. One difficulty to evaluate the relevance of our approach is that there is no reference database available. We made, thus, our own dataset. The results are quite encouraging regarding what; was expected and what provide methods the literature.",
          "As-built building information model (BIM) is an urgent need of the architecture, engineering, construction and facilities management (AEC/FM) community. However, its creation procedure is still labor-intensive and far from maturity. Taking advantage of prevalence of digital cameras and the development of advanced computer vision technology, the paper proposes to reconstruct a building facade and recognize its surface materials from images taken from various points of view. These can serve as initial steps towards automatic generation of as-built BIM. Specifically, 3D point clouds are generated from multiple images using structure from motion method and then segmented into planar components, which are further recognized as different structural components through knowledge based reasoning. Windows are detected through a multilayered complementary strategy by combining detection results from every semantic layer. A novel machine learning based 3D material recognition strategy is presented. Binary classifiers are trained through support vector machines. Material type at a given 3D location is predicted by all its corresponding 2D feature points. Experimental results from three existing buildings validate the proposed system.",
          "Semantic segmentation of building facade point clouds has diverse applications. The development of semantic segmentation methods is inextricably linked to datasets. The available building facade datasets suffer from a lack of abundant semantic categories and data completeness. To compensate for these shortcomings, we propose a new building facade dataset characterized by various categories and relatively complete 3-D building facades. In addition, most existing methods focus on fully supervised learning, which relies on manually labeling large-scale point cloud data and results in high time and labor costs. In this article, we propose an effective weakly supervised building facade segmentation approach, called spatial adaptive fusion consistency contrastive constraint (SAF-C3), to solve the above problem. We first design a multirandom point cloud augmentor as an auxiliary supervision branch to enhance the learning ability of the original network branch. Then, we present a spatial adaptive fusion (SAF) module to extract discriminative features for building facade point clouds. Finally, we propose a spatial consistency contrastive constraint to explore the contrastive property in feature space and to ensure the predictive consistency among the augmentation and original branches. The proposed method achieves a significant performance improvement against the state-of-the-art methods on two building facade point cloud datasets through extensive experiments. In particular, the performance of SAF-C3 with 1% labels significantly surpasses the baseline network with 100% labels.",
          "Architectural styles and their evolution are central to architecture history. However, traditional approaches to understand styles and their evolution require domain expertise, fieldwork and extensive manual processes. Recent research in deep learning and computer vision has highlighted the great potential in analyzing urban environments from images. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework for understanding architectural styles and age epochs by deciphering building facades based on street-level imagery. The frame-work is composed of two stages: Deep 'Learning' the architecture and Deep 'Interpreting' the architecture age epochs and styles. In Deep 'Learning', a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model is designed to automatically learn about the age characteristics of building facades from street view images. In Deep 'Inter-preting' stage, three components are proposed to understand the different perspectives regarding building ages and styles. In the experiment, a building age epoch dataset is compiled for the city of Amsterdam and Stockholm to understand the evolution of architectural element styles and the relationship between building ages and styles spatially and temporally. This research illustrates how publicly available data and deep learning could be used to trace the evolution of architectural styles in the spatial-temporal domain.",
          "Nowadays, multi-camera aerial platforms combining nadir and oblique cameras are experiencing a revival and several companies have proposed new image acquisition systems. Due to their various advantages, oblique imagery have found their place in numerous companies and civil applications. However, the automatic processing of such image blocks still remains a topic of research. Camera configuration indeed poses a challenge on the traditional photogrammetric pipeline used in commercial software but, on the other hand, gives the opportunity to exploit the additional information provided by the oblique views and allows a more reliable feature extraction. In particular, the information that can be provided in correspondence of building facades can open new possibilities for the building detection and footprint extraction. In this paper, a methodology for the automated extraction of building footprints from oblique imagery is presented. The extraction is performed using dense point clouds generated using an image matching algorithm.

However, the quality and controllability of generated images, and the interpretability of model are still potential to be improved. In this paper, by implementing StyleGAN2 model, plausible building facade images could be generated without conditional input. In addition, by applying GANSpace to analysis the latent space, high-level properties could be controlled for both generated images and novel images outside of training set. At last, the generating and controlling process could be visualized with image embedding and PCA projection method, which could achieve unsupervised classification of generated images, and help to understand the correlation between the images and their latent vectors.",
          "Detecting building facade elements is a crucial problem in computer vision for image interpretation. In Building Information Modeling (BIM) studies, the detection of building facade elements has an important role. BIM is a tool that allows maintaining a digital representation of all aspects of building information; therefore, it will enable the storage of almost any data related to a given structure, regarding its geometric and non-geometric aspects. Facade segmentation was first studied in the 1970s using hand-crafted expertise. Later, detection and segmentation studies emerged based on shapes of objects and parametric rules. With the developing technology, deep learning approaches in object detection studies have intensified. It is obvious that the desired analyses can be performed faster with deep learning approaches. However, deep learning methods require large training data. Algorithms that consider different situations and are suitable for real-world scenarios continue to be developed. The need in this direction continues in the literature. In this study, door and window detection was carried out with deep learning on an original data set. The algorithms used are YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, and Faster R-CNN. Precision, recall and mean average precision (mAP) are used as evaluation metrics. As a result of the study, precision, recall, and mAP values with YOLOv5 were obtained as 0.85, 0.72, and 0.79, respectively. With Faster R-CNN with the lowest performance, precision, recall, and mAP were obtained as 0.54, 0.63, and 0.54, respectively.",
          "The purpose of the study presented here is to enrich low resolution (LODI) 3D city models with semantic information about the architectural style of buildings The focus is on identitying Wilhelminian style buildings - terraced houses with three to four floors, high storeys, richly decorated facades and an architectural style typical for the turn of the 20th century We use this example for the evaluation of the potential of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for data mining in 3D city models Identification of Wilhelminian style buildings with low level data is demanding since most distinguishing characteristics are on higher levels of de tail However, Wilhelminian style buildings tend to form specific ensembles of buildings with similar shape thus context information is significant After careful pre-processing feature extraction, and feature weighting, a Support Vector Machine with a radial basis function as kernel was trained In contract to other classifiers which minimize the em pineal Support Vector Machines are based on structural risk minimization This approach turned out to be especially useful for a task where the respective classes are highly inhomogeneous and a high percentage of the training data is mislabeled In order to reduce the effect of the latter an outlier detection was applied as part of the pre-processing Above, a clustering algorithm was used to cope with hidden structures in the training data Despite difficult boundary conditions the SVM classifier was able to detect Wilhelminian style houses with high accuracy This demonstrates the high potential of Support Vector Machines for data mining in 3D City Models However intelligent pre-processing and kernel parameter optimization are necessary",
          "In recent years, artificial intelligence technology has widely influenced the design field, introducing new ideas to efficiently and systematically solve urban renewal design problems. The purpose of this study is to create a stylized generation technology for building facade decoration in historic districts, which will aid in the design and control of district style and form. The goal is to use the technical advantages of the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) in image generation and style transfer to create a method for independently designing a specific facade decoration style by interpreting image data of historical district facades. The research in this paper is based on the historical district of Putian in Fujian Province and facilitates an experiment of image data acquisition, image processing and screening, model training, image generation, and style matching of the target area. The research found the following: (1) CGAN technology can better identify and generate the decorative style of historical districts. It can realize the overall or partial scheme design of the facade. (2) In terms of adaptability, this method can provide a better scheme reference for historical district reconstruction, facade renovation, and renovation design projects. Especially for districts with obvious decorative styles, the visualization effect is better. In addition, it also has certain reference significance for the determination and design of the facade decoration style of a specific historical building. (3) Lastly, this method can better learn the internal laws of the complex district style and form to generate a new design with a clear decoration style attribute. It can be extended to other fields of historical heritage protection to enhance practitioners' stylized control of the heritage environment and improve the efficiency and capability of professional design.",
          "Recently, performance improvement in facade parsing from 3D point clouds has been brought about by designing more complex network structures, which cost huge computing resources and do not take full advantage of prior knowledge of facade structure. Instead, from the perspective of data distribution, we construct a new hierarchical mesh multi-view data domain based on the characteristics of facade objects to achieve fusion of deep-learning models and prior knowledge, thereby significantly improving segmentation accuracy. We comprehensively evaluate the current mainstream method on the RueMonge 2014 data set and demonstrate the superiority of our method. The mean intersection-over-union index on the facade-parsing task reached 76.41%, which is 2.75% higher than the current best result. In addition, through comparative experiments, the reasons for the performance improvement of the proposed method are further analyzed.",
          "In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework, namely AFGL-Net to achieve building facade parsing, i.e., obtaining the semantics of small components of building facade, such as windows and doors. To this end, we present an autoencoder embedding position and direction encoding for local feature encoding. The autoencoder enhances the local feature aggregation and augments the representation of skeleton features of windows and doors. We also integrate the Transformer into AFGL-Net to infer the geometric shapes and structural arrangements of facade components and capture the global contextual features. These global features can help recognize inapparent windows/doors from the facade points corrupted with noise, outliers, occlusions, and irregularities. The attention-based feature fusion mechanism is finally employed to obtain more informative features by simultaneously considering local geometric details and the global contexts. The proposed AFGL-Net is comprehensively evaluated on Dublin and RueMonge2014 benchmarks, achieving 67.02% and 59.80% mIoU, respectively. We also demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AFGL-Net by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods and various ablation studies.",
          "Land-use maps are important references for urban planning and urban studies. Given the heterogeneity of urban land-use types, it is difficult to differentiate different land-use types based on overhead remotely sensed data. Google Street View (GSV) images, which capture the facades of building blocks along streets, could be better used to judge the land-use types of different building blocks based on their facade appearances. Recently developed scene classification algorithms in computer vision community make it possible to categorize different photos semantically based on various image feature descriptors and machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a method to derive detailed land-use information at building block level based on scene classification algorithms and GSV images. Three image feature descriptors (i.e., scale-invariant feature transform-Fisher, histogram of oriented gradients, GIST) were used to represent GSV images of different buildings. Existing land-use maps were used to create training datasets to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for categorizing GSV images. The trained SVM classifiers were then applied to case study areas in New York City, Boston, and Houston, to predict the land-use information at building block level. Accuracy assessment results show that the proposed method is suitable for differentiating residential buildings and nonresidential buildings with an accuracy of 85% or so. Since the GSV images are publicly accessible, this proposed method would provide a new way for building block level land-use mapping in future.",
          "With the emergence of Generative Adversarial Networks, great progress has been made in image inpainting. However, most existing methods can produce plausible results, but fail to generate finer textures and structures. This is mainly due to the fact that (1) the generation of finer content in the masked region of an image is not constrained enough during network training, and (2) many different alternative pixels are exist to fill in the masked regions, making it very difficult for the inpainting network to generate reasonable sharp edges. To address these issues, we propose a Scale Enhanced GAN (SE-GAN) model which combines the constraints of large- and small-scale receptive fields of our tailor-made discriminators to achieve fine-grained constraint on image details, a novel edge loss to further ensure the sharpness of the generated image. Experiments on multiple datasets including faces(CelebA-HQ), textures(DTD), buildings(Facade) and natural images(ImageNet, Places2) show that our approach can generate higher quality inpainting results with more details than previous methods.",
          "The quality of the urban environment is crucial for societal well-being. Yet, measuring and tracking the quality of urban environment, their evolution, and spatial disparities is difficult due to the amount of on-the-ground data needed to capture these patterns. The growing availability of street view images presents new prospects in identifying urban features. However, the reliability and consistency of these methods across different locations and time remains largely unexplored. We aim to develop a comprehensive index of urban quality and change at the street segment level using Google Street View (GSV) imagery. We focus on eight object classes that indicate urban decay or contribute to an unsightly urban space, such as potholes, graffiti, garbage, tents, barred or broken windows, discolored or dilapidated facades, weeds, and utility markings. We train an object detection model on a dataset of images from different cities and assess the performance of these urban indices. We evaluate the effectiveness of this method in various urban contexts over time and discuss its potential for urban planning and public policy. We demonstrate the use of these indices in three applications: the Tenderloin in San Francisco, the Doctores and Historic Center neighborhoods in Mexico City, and South Bend, Indiana.",
          "Maintaining a public register by extracting urban objects from photos taken in the city is one of the most important tasks for municipal services. It is of great importance in the field of protection and shaping of the cultural landscape, protection of monuments, and registration of the urban tissue development. The current state of the art shows that deep learning models (DL models) can cope with the problem of extracting urban objects with the same or better performance than non-DL models, and can process video and photos automatically. This paper compares the three main DL models for facade instance detection and facade segmentation: Mask R-CNN, YOLACT, and Mask-Scoring R-CNN. The training and validation datasets used for transfer learning were created on the basis of spherical photos taken in an artificially generated virtual city. The test dataset, on the other hand, included spherical facade photos taken in a real city. The comparative analysis of the DL models was performed using parametric and nonparametric statistical tests for pairwise and multiple comparisons.",
          "Object removal and inpainting approaches typically require a user to manually create a mask around occluding objects. While creating masks for a small number of images is possible, it rapidly becomes untenable for longer image sequences. Instead, we accomplish this step automatically using an object detection framework to explicitly recognize and remove several classes of occlusions. We propose using this technique to improve 3D urban reconstruction from street level imagery, in which building facades are frequently occluded by vegetation or vehicles. By assuming facades in the background are planar, 3D scene estimation provides important context to the inpainting process by restricting input sample patches to regions that are coplanar to the occlusion, leading to more realistic final textures. Moreover, because non-static and reflective occlusion classes tend to be difficult to reconstruct, explicitly recognizing and removing them improves the resulting 3D scene.",
          "LiDAR is considered as an effective technology for digitizing the real scene at a very high-resolution and in a short time. However, the resolution of the LiDAR is not sufficient to identify and evaluate the facade surface features like edges and cracks. Generally, photographs provide a better interpretation of the linear characteristics. The complementary benefits of each allow exploring valuable spatial information with different surface detail levels. The paper introduces a flexible image-based approach for linear feature extraction from LiDAR point cloud. Initially, the algorithm converts the point clouds into a structured depth image to reduce the complexity and computation time. Using transformation matrix and camera calibration parameters, the visible point clouds are perceptively projected into color image space using co-linearity equations. The result depth channel is sampled with the interpolation process and added to the color channels to compute (RGBD) layers. The edges and linear features of the surface are initially extracted using the optical 2D imagery and subsequently, each pixel of the linear features can be projected directly into 3D space. Due to the various acquisition positions of the laser and color images, the issue of occlusion is resolved using the visibility algorithm. Applying the methodology, experimental results from the Treasury Monument of Jordan's ancient Petra City, indicate that the developed approach provides adequate contour points for better interpretation and quantification of weathering processes and dangerous cracking. 3D Modeling these features can also reduce data size, facilitating surface inspection and analysis with simpler models.",
          "With strong inference of hierarchical and repetitive structures, semantic information has been widely used in dealing with urban scenes. In this paper, we present a super-pixel-based facade parsing framework which combines the top-down shape grammar splitting with bottom-up information aggregation: machine learning forecasts prior classes, super-pixels improve compactness, and boundary estimation divides the splitting into two procedures raw and fine, providing a reasonable initial guess for the latter to achieve better random-walk optimization results. We also put forward the correlation judging between floors for the purpose of compromising freedom degree reduction with style variety and flexibility, which is also introduced as alignment constraint term to extend the probability energy. Experiments show that our method converges fast and achieves the state-of-the-art results for different styles. Further study on understanding and reconstruction is in progress of exploiting these results.",
          "Building facade detection is an important problem in computer vision, with applications in mobile robotics and semantic scene understanding. In particular, mobile platform localization and guidance in urban environments can be enabled with accurate models of the various building facades in a scene. Toward that end, we present a system for detection, segmentation, and parameter estimation of building facades in stereo imagery. The proposed method incorporates multilevel appearance and disparity features in a binary discriminative model, and generates a set of candidate planes by sampling and clustering points from the image with Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), using local normal estimates derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to inform the planar models. These two models are incorporated into a two-layer Markov Random Field (MRF): an appearance- and disparity-based discriminative classifier at the mid-level, and a geometric model to segment the building pixels into facades at the high-level. By using object-specific stereo features, our discriminative classifier is able to achieve substantially higher accuracy than standard boosting or modeling with only appearance-based features. Furthermore, the results of our MRF classification indicate a strong improvement in accuracy for the binary building detection problem and the labeled planar surface models provide a good approximation to the ground truth planes.",
          "We present a system to extract architectural assets from large-scale collections of panoramic imagery. We automatically rectify and crop parts of the panoramic image that contain dominant planes, and then use object detection to extract assets such as facades and windows. We also provide various tools to identify attributes of the assets to determine the asset quality and index the assets for search. In addition, we propose a User Interface (UI) to visualize and query assets. Finally, we present applications for urban modeling and texture synthesis.",
          "The Bukchon area in Seoul boasts a high density of Hanok, the traditional Korean architecture representing the region. Because the Hanok facade plays a vital role in the streetscape formation, we must record it in terms of social, cultural, historical, artistic, and scenic values. However, recording the facade of an existing Hanok building through drawing or image information is time consuming and labor intensive, and therefore costly. Further, its digital conversion is inherently difficult. This study proposes the use of deep learning to identify the form elements that comprise the Hanok facade. Three-dimensional modeling was performed on 405 well-preserved Hanok facades in the region, and 2808 items of image data were created under similar conditions and at differing angles. Labeling was performed on the shape elements of the Hanok facade, and a methodology was established to identify the facade elements using MASK R-CNN. The type of roof, windows, the lower part of the outer wall, and the design were identified with high accuracy.",
          "The urban built environment of contemporary cities confronts a constant risk of deterioration due to natural or artificial reasons. Especially political aggression and war conflicts have significant destructive effects on architectural and cultural heritage buildings. The post-war urbanscapes demonstrate the striking effects of the armed conflicts during the hot war encounters. However, the residues of the urbanscapes become the actual indicators of damage and loss. Since today we can make future predictions using a variety of machine learning algorithms, it is possible to represent hybrid projections of urban heterotopias. In this context, this research proposes to explore dystopian post-war projections for modern cities based on their architectural styles and demonstrate the utopian scenarios of rehabilitation possibilities for the damaged urban built environment of post-war cities by using generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithms. Two primary datasets containing the post-war and pre-war building facades have been given as the input data for the CycleGAN and pix2pix GAN models. Thus, two different image-to-image GAN models have been compared regarding their ability to produce legible building facade projections in architectural features. Besides, the machine learning process results have been discussed in terms of cities' utopian and dystopian future predictions, demonstrating the war conflicts' immense effects on the built environment. Moreover, the immediate consequence of the destructive aggression on tangible and intangible architectural heritage would become visible to inhabitants and policymakers when the AI-generated rehabilitation potentials have been exposed.",
          "The aim of this study is to investigate how children behave in the landscape of three Chinese residential quarters. Based on information collected through investigation using Principal Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis, the residential landscapes are classified into ten types, each of which can be generally described according to four spatial factors-exposure, proximity to water, accessibility, and relative building facade. The results show that: 1) playing is the most typical behaviour of children; 2) space with some degree of exposure has a more obvious effect on the distribution of children's behaviour, and most children prefer to play along the waterside; 3) children without independent action ability tend to play in a semi-open space with a safe and stable environment, while those with independent action ability choose their play space more freely; 4) integrated open space that can be easily accessed, has a waterfront landscape and is near a building facade, may significantly stimulate children's behaviour.",
          "Point clouds with ever-increasing volume are regular data in 3D city modelling, in which building reconstruction is a significant part. The photogrammetric point cloud, generated from UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) imagery, is a novel type of data in building reconstruction. Its positive characteristics, alongside its challenging qualities, provoke discussions on this theme of research. In this paper, patch-wise detection of the points of window frames on facades and roofs are undertaken using this kind of data. A density-based multi-scale filter is devised in the feature space of normal vectors to globally handle the matter of high volume of data and to detect edges. Color information is employed for the downsized data to remove the inner clutter of the building. Perceptual organization directs the approach via grouping and the Gestalt principles, to segment the filtered point cloud and to later detect window patches. The evaluation of the approach displays a completeness of 95% and 92%, respectively, as well as a correctness of 95% and 96%, respectively, for the detection of rectangular and partially curved window frames in two big heterogeneous cluttered datasets. Moreover, most intrusions and protrusions cannot mislead the window detection approach. Several doors with glass parts and a number of parallel parts of the scaffolding are mistaken as windows when using the large-scale object detection approach due to their similar patterns with window frames. Sensitivity analysis of the input parameters demonstrates that the filter functionality depends on the radius of density calculation in the feature space. Furthermore, successfully employing the Gestalt principles in the detection of window frames is influenced by the width determination of window partitioning.",
          "Repeated patterns (such as windows, balconies, and doors) are prominent and significant features in urban scenes. Therefore, detection of these repeated patterns becomes very important for city scene analysis. This paper attacks the problem of repeated pattern detection in a precise, efficient and automatic way, by combining traditional feature extraction with a Kronecker product based low-rank model. We introduced novel algorithms that extract repeated patterns from rectified images with solid theoretical support. Our method is tailored for 2D images of building facades and tested on a large set of facade images.",
          "Within the fields of urban reconstruction and city modeling, shape grammars have emerged as a powerful tool for both synthesizing novel designs and reconstructing buildings. Traditionally, a human expert was required to write grammars for specific building styles, which limited the scope of method applicability. We present an approach to automatically learn two-dimensional attributed stochastic context-free grammars (2D-ASCFGs) from a set of labeled building facades. To this end, we use Bayesian Model Merging, a technique originally developed in the field of natural language processing, which we extend to the domain of two-dimensional languages. Given a set of labeled positive examples, we induce a grammar which can be sampled to create novel instances of the same building style. In addition, we demonstrate that our learned grammar can be used for parsing existing facade imagery. Experiments conducted on the dataset of Haussmannian buildings in Paris show that our parsing with learned grammars not only outperforms bottom-up classifiers but is also on par with approaches that use a manually designed style grammar.",
          "Existing deep models for facade parsing often fail in classifying pixels in heavily occluded regions of facade images due to the difficulty in feature representation of these pixels. In this paper, we solve facade parsing with occlusions by progressive feature learning. To this end, we locate the regions contaminated by occlusions via Bayesian uncertainty evaluation on categorizing each pixel in these regions. Then, guided by the uncertainty, we propose an occlusion-immune facade parsing architecture in which we progressively re-express the features of pixels in each contaminated region from easy to hard. Specifically, the outside pixels, which have reliable context from visible areas, are re-expressed at early stages; the inner pixels are processed at late stages when their surroundings have been decontaminated at the earlier stages. In addition, at each stage, instead of using regular square convolution kernels, we design a context enhancement module (CEM) with directional strip kernels, which can aggregate structural context to re-express facade pixels. Extensive experiments on popular facade datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.",
          "In the remote sensing community, land-cover classification is usually performed on the top-view images. However, besides the top-view features (including elevation), facade captured by the oblique images is useful but severely underutilized in the land-cover classification. The facade information of an object, is by nature more variable, thus can be extremely useful when the extracted features are used for land-cover classification. Hence, in this paper, we try to explore the use of facade from the oblique images to enhance the accuracy of land-cover classification. Firstly, we locate the facades by finding the elevation changes and the corresponding above-ground objects. Then, the facade images are cropped from oblique images and the color and Haar-like features are extracted as facade features. Finally, following the object-based land-cover classification, super-pixels are generated and used as the basic unit for the feature extraction and classification. Experiments are performed on five representative site using five-head oblique aerial images and their derived orthophoto and digital surface model (DSM). The results show that with the facade information, the classification performances have been steadily improved, especially for the buildings which has around 10% improvement.",
          "Parsing building facades into procedural grammars plays an important role for 3D building model generation tasks, which have been long desired in computer vision. Deep learning is a promising approach to facade parsing, however, a straightforward solution by directly applying standard deep learning approaches cannot always yield the optimal results. This is primarily due to two reasons: 1) it is nontrivial to train existing semantic segmentation networks for facade parsing, e.g., Fully-Convolutional Neural Networks (FCN) which are usually weak at predicting fine-grained shapes (J. Long et al., 2015); and 2) building facades are man-made architectures with highly regularized shape priors, and the prior knowledge plays an important role in facade parsing, for which how to integrate the prior knowledge into deep neural networks remains an open problem. In this paper, we present a novel symmetric loss function that can be used in deep neural networks for end-to-end training. This novel loss is based on the assumption that most of windows and doors have a highly symmetric rectangle shape, and it penalizes all window predictions that are non-rectangles. This prior knowledge is smoothly integrated into the end-to-end training process. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our method has outperformed previous state-of-art methods significantly on five popular facade parsing datasets. Qualitative results have shown that our method effectively aids deep convolutional neural networks to predict more accurate, visually pleasing, and symmetric shapes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate symmetry constraint into end-to-end training in deep neural networks for facade parsing."

          "Modern architecture promotes a high demand for transparent building envelopes and especially glass facades. Commonly, facades are designed to fulfill a multitude of objectives such as superior aesthetic appearance, a higher degree of weathering reliability, quick installation, high transparency as well as economic and ecologic efficiency. For such glazing applications, often an assessment of acoustic properties and especially sound insulation abilities are required. Because of the complexity of such an experimental or computational investigation given the framing systems and glass unit compositions, a reliable and fairly accurate estimation of sound insulation properties of such systems becomes time-consuming and demanding. This paper provides a Machine Learning (ML) based estimation tool of acoustic properties (weighted sound insulation value RW, STC and OITC) of different glazing set-ups. A sufficiently rich database was used to train several machine learning algorithms. The acoustic properties are determined by comparing the third-octave or octave band spectrum of the sound reduction index with a reference curve (typical curve for solid construction elements) specified in the standard DIN EN ISO 717-1. Sound insulation values can currently only be determined by complex and expensive experimental investigations or numerical simulations for certain glass set-ups. Hence, there is no efficient tool for convenient and reliable estimation of the sound insulation performance of glazing systems available at the moment. To this end, the engineering team led by the authors conducted extensive studies on various glazings consisting of different glass assemblies with varying glass, cavity and interlayer thicknesses and different types of interlayer and gas fillings. Based on our research outcomes, a comprehensive web-based prediction program, the so-called AI Tool, has been developed recently. This program can provide a quick analysis and accurate prediction of arbitrary glazing set-ups, interlayers and glazing infills. A series of laboratory tests were conducted to validate the predictions by the AI Tool. The goal of this program is to provide designers, engineers, and architects an effective and economically efficient tool to facilitate the design w.r.t. acoustical properties.",
          "People spend approximately 90% of their lives indoors, and thus arguably, the indoor space design can significantly influence occupant well-being. Adequate views to the outside are one of the most cited indoor qualities related to occupant well-being. However, due to urbanization and densification trends, designers may have difficulties in providing vistas and views to the outside with an assortment of content, which can support the needs of their occupants. To better understand occupant view satisfaction and provide reliable design feedback to architects, existing view satisfaction data must be expanded to capture a wider variety of view scenarios and occupants. Most related research remains challenging in architectural practice due to a lack of easy-to-use early design analysis tools. However, early assessment of view can be advantageous as design decisions in early design, such as building orientation, plan layout, and facade design, can improve the view quality. This paper, hence, presents results from a 181 participant view satisfaction survey with 590 window views. The survey data is used to train a tree-regression model to predict view satisfaction. The prediction performance was compared to an existing view assessment framework through case studies. The result showed that the new prediction (RMSE = 0.65) is more accurate to the surveyed result than the framework (RMSE = 3.78). Further, the prediction performance was generally high (R-2 >= 0.64) for most responses, verifying the reliability. To facilitate view analysis in early design, this paper describes integrating the satisfaction prediction model and a ray-casting tool to compute view parameters in the CAD environment.",
          "The application of Double Skin Facades (DSFs) in hot climates is limited and their potential benefits are still under investigation. Moreover, daylight and thermal performances of the double facade are rarely studied together. In this paper a set of parameters are optimized for the design of a folded porous double facade for an existing office building in Cairo, with an aim of reducing cooling loads while maintaining daylight needs. The design and optimization processes take place using parametric design software, specifically Grasshopper Plugin for Rhino 3D modeller. These software tools were chosen due to the possibility of using evolutionary algorithms for multi-objective optimization, and environmental simulation plugins that provide real-time feedback during the early design phase. The existing building acts as a reference case to which the proposed facade is compared to evaluate its performance in South-East and North-West orientations. It is also compared to a conventional double facade. The paper discusses the effect of the design parameters on the thermal and daylight performances of the facade highlighting their preferred numerical range. Limitations of the software used are addressed, requiring verification of results using CFD simulations in future work.",
          "Daylight is an important factor that significantly contributes to patients' healing, with a reduction in the length of stay in the hospital. It can strongly affect energy consumption negatively or positively through lighting control strategies. Therefore, the case of healthcare buildings is very particular and sensitive, especially under extreme climate conditions as in hot and arid regions. The present study aims to determine a balance between daylight use and energy consumption through a parametric-based optimization of the external shading system in a typical hospital room in Biskra. This paper demonstrates how the implementation of parametric design with evolutionary algorithms is considered a reliable strategy to reach optimum solutions in building performance problems. The daylight performance is investigated based on multi-objective optimization to minimize the Energy Use Intensity EUI, while maximizing Spatial Daylight Autonomy sDA and Useful Daylight Illuminance UDI. A simulation model was developed via Grasshopper, which was employed with the use of Ladybug, Honeybee, and Octopus plug-ins. The results revealed that the adaptive facade system can improve indoor daylight levels and energy performance simultaneously compared to the conventional shading system. The presented framework may be used as a reference model, which can enhance opportunities to solve complex design problems in the early design stages and suggest recommendations for sustainable building design.",
          "Windows are one of the non-structural components of buildings that are most vulnerable to wind damage. It is important to obtain rapid and accurate predictions of wind-induced window damage in urban areas. A novel automated method for simulating the wind damage to building windows at the city scale is proposed in this study based on oblique photography, deep learning, and computational fluid dynamics technologies. First, a method for extracting building facade pixels from oblique aerial images is proposed to provide the data basis for subsequent window recognition. Second, the Pix2Pix deep learning network is utilized to recognize windows on building facades. Finally, the window damage in building clusters is evaluated automatically based on the window failure model and time-varying wind pressure data obtained through computational fluid dynamics simulations. A real-world community in Shenzhen, China, is used as a case study to showcase the workflow and demonstrate the reliability and feasibility of the proposed method. The proposed automated method overcomes the limitation that existing methods are difficult to apply to real building clusters. The novel method and corresponding case study presented here can provide a reference for urban areas to mitigate the impacts of wind disasters.",
          "Probabilistic methods can be used to account for uncertainties in hygrothermal analysis of building envelopes. This paper presents methods for robust mould reliability analysis and identification of critical parameters. Mould indices are calculated by probabilistic hygrothermal analysis, followed by the application of the Finnish mould growth model. To increase the robustness of the mould growth analysis, a random forests metamodel is first trained on the dataset and then used to expand the number of simulations. Finally, the reliability is calculated based on the probability of exceeding a given maximum mould index limit state. Critical parameters are identified through a sensitivity analysis based on linear and non-linear dependencies between inputs and maximum mould index. The methods are demonstrated by analysing three external wall assemblies. In conclusion, the mould reliability analysis method helps to assess the robustness of the hygrothermal analysis and mould assessment by investigating the influence of hygrothermal variables' uncertainties on the maximum mould index. By combining a metamodel with probabilistic analysis, it is possible to significantly reduce the amount of time required to evaluate a large number of scenarios.",
          "Building databases are important assets when estimating and planning for national energy savings from energy retrofitting. However, databases often lack information on building characteristics needed to determine the feasibility of specific energy conservation measures. In this paper, machine learning methods are used to enrich the Swedish database of Energy Performance Certificates with building characteristics relevant for a chosen set of energy retrofitting packages. The study is limited to the Swedish multifamily building stock constructed between 1945 and 1975, as these buildings are facing refurbishment needs that advantageously can be combined with energy retrofitting. In total, 514 ocular observations were conducted in Google Street View of two building characteristics that were needed to determine the feasibility of the chosen energy retrofitting packages: (i) building type and (ii) suitability for additional facade insulation. Results showed that these building characteristics could be predicted with an accuracy of 88.9% and 72.5% respectively. It could be concluded that machine learning methods show promising potential to enrich building databases with building characteristics relevant for energy retrofitting, which in turn can improve estimations of national energy savings potential.",
          "Successful daylighting design is a complex task which requires the designer to consider numerous design elements and their effects on multiple performance criteria. Facades, in particular, include many variables which may dramatically impact daylighting performance. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are optimization methods which are suitable for searching large solution spaces, such as those presented by design problems. This article presents a GA-based tool which facilitates the exploration of facade designs generated based on illuminance and/or glare objectives. The method allows the user to input an original 3d massing model and performance goals. The overall building form remains the same while facade elements may change. Ten parameters are considered, including materials and geometry of apertures and shading devices. A simple building data model is used to automatically generate a 3d model of each solution. Results from single- and multi-objective case studies are presented to demonstrate a successful goal-driven design exploration process.",
          "The selection of high-performance building facade systems is essential to promote building energy efficiency. However, this selection is highly dependent on early-stage design decisions, which are extremely challenging considering numerous design parameters with early-stage uncertainties. This paper aims to evaluate the appli-cability of deep learning networks in estimating the energy savings of different facade alternatives in the early-stage design of buildings. The energy performance of two competing facade systems (i.e., Ultra-High-Performance Fiber-Reinforced-Concrete and conventional panels) was estimated for different scenarios through building en-ergy simulations using EnergyPlusrm. Three deep learning networks were trained using the collected data from the simulation of fourteen buildings in fourteen different locations to estimate the heating, cooling, and total site energy savings. The accuracy of trained deep networks was compared with the accuracy of three common data-driven prediction models including, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, and Generalized Linear Regression. The results showed that the deep learning network trained to predict building total site energy savings had the highest accuracy among other models with a mean absolute error of 1.59 and a root mean square error of 3.48, followed by Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, and last Generalized Linear Regression. Similarly, deep networks trained to predict building cooling and heating energy savings had the lowest mean average error of 0.20 and 1.17, respectively, compared to other predictive models. It is expected the decision support system developed based on this methodology helps architects and designers to quantify the energy savings of different facade systems in early stages of design decisions.",
          "This paper presents a high-level overview of a methodology for analysing window shade use in existing buildings. Time-lapse photography is paired with a robust image recognition algorithm to facilitate assessment of shade use and identify any possible trends. The methodology applied on a high-rise building consisting of multiple open plan offices. The analysis showed that the mean shade occlusion and the shade movement rate depend on facade orientation, with the near-south facade having the highest values and the near-north facade having the lowest ones. An average shade use rate of 0.5/day was observed, with the 72% of the shades never adjusted, throughout the period of observation.",
          "The energy-efficient operation of microgrids -a localized grouping of consuming loads (domestic appliances, EVs, etc.) with distributed energy sources such as solar photovoltaic panels- suggests the deployment of Energy Management Systems (EMSs) that enable the actuation of controllable microgrid loads coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. Such tools are capable of optimizing the aggregated performance of the microgrid in an automated manner, based on an extensive network of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Modular adaptable/dynamic building envelope (ADBE) solutions have been proven an effective solution-exploiting free facade areas instead of roof areas-for extending the thermal inertia and energy harvesting capacity in existing buildings of different nature (residential, commercial, industrial, etc.). This study presents the PLUG-N-HARVEST holistic workflow towards the delivery of an automatically controllable microgrid integrating active ADBE technologies (e.g., PVs, HVACs). The digital platform comprises cloud AI services and functionalities for energy-efficient management, data healing/cleansing, flexibility forecasting, and the security-by-design IoT to efficiently optimize the overall performance in near-zero energy buildings and microgrids. The current study presents the effective design and necessary digital integration steps towards the PLUG-N-HARVEST ICT platform alongside real-life verification test results, validating the performance of the platform.",
          "The association between a building facade involving a matrix of programmable windows, for a prototype house, and the adjustment of the natural light at the house interior is treated algorithmically. The facade operates as a dynamic filter between exterior and interior: it filters solar radiation and heat by allowing the modification of the chromatism and light transmittance of each individual window. Varying the number and the distribution of the active windows on the facade permits the regulation of the incoming sun light and affects the visual presence of the house. A generative grammar producing the language of the optimum facade patterns, is presented. The novelty is that the grammar instead of encoding stylistic conventions, captures performative constraints and encodes them visually, to produce efficient and elegant patterns on the facade.",
          "The design of moisture-durable building enclosures is complicated by the number of materials, exposure conditions, and performance requirements. Hygrothermal simulations are used to assess moisture durability, but these require in-depth knowledge to be properly implemented. Machine learning (ML) offers the opportunity to simplify the design process by eliminating the need to carry out hygrothermal simulations. ML was used to assess the moisture durability of a building enclosure design and simplify the design process. This work used ML to predict the mold index and maximum moisture content of layers in typical residential wall constructions. Results show that ML, within the constraints of the construction, including exposure conditions, does an excellent job in predicting performance compared to hygrothermal simulations with a coefficient of determination, R-2, over 0.90. Furthermore, the results indicate that the material properties of the vapor barrier and continuous insulation layer are strongly correlated to performance.",
          "Enclosed airspaces (EAs) are a common component of different energy efficient technologies in building envelopes which have intrinsic adaptive behavior under various climatic conditions. The need for comprehensive accurate numerical models without restrictions for different applications still exists. Thus, for the first time, machine learning and regression-based techniques (Ordinary least squares Linear Regression (OLR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), r-Nearest Neighbors (rNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)) were applied to develop precise models derived from the most credible experimental data with stochastic logic of testing and training in several runs. It was found that application of KRR, SVR, and ANN leads to the most desirable outcomes with highest R-2 (0.97-0.99), and lowest errors, however OLR does not provide satisfactory results (R-2 <0.6). Moreover, major deviations are observed for calculations by OLR, kNN, and rNN in horizontal EAs (thicknesses = 40mm) with downward heat flow direction.",
          "An adaptive control and system identification framework is presented. This framework is applied for closed-loop system identification and adaptive heating demand-response control for residential buildings. The building envelope, considered for control purposes within the context of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy, is based on the simplified Resistive-Capacitive analogy. These models characterized with parametric and state uncertainty, are adapted by incorporating, on-line, learning-based Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) for the joint state-parameter based estimation problem. Learning-based Moving Horizon Estimation, in this context, incorporates a reinforcement learning (RL) strategy. The latter entails a Q-factor parametrized value function approximation of the MHE arrival cost which is adapted (learned) on-line using a temporal difference algorithm based on the MPC control policy.",
          "The selection of an energy-efficient building facade system, as one of the most important early-stage design decisions, plays a crucial role in reducing building energy use by controlling heat transmission between outdoor and indoor environments. This paper aims to evaluate the feasibility and applicability of gradient boosting machines in estimating the energy savings of different facade alternatives in the early-stage design of building facades. The energy performance of two competing facade systems was estimated for different scenarios using building energy simulations (i.e. EnergyPlus (TM)). Three gradient boosting machines were developed based on the data collected from the simulation of thirteen building types in fifteen different locations (i.e. 195 scenarios). The prediction performance of gradient boosting models was compared with the building energy simulation results of two new building models that were not used in the database development phase to validate the models. Moreover, the prediction power of the trained gradient boosting models was compared with three common prediction models (i.e. Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, and Generalized Linear Regression) based on several performance metrics. The results showed the superiority of gradient boosting machines over other models in estimating total site energy savings, heating energy savings, and buildings' cooling energy savings.",
          "This study aims to develop a machine learning and deep learning-based model for thermal performance prediction of PCM integrated roof building. Performance prediction is carried out using the newly proposed MKR index. Five machine learning and one deep learning technique are explored in order to predict the thermal performance of PCM integrated roof considering variations in thermophysical properties of PCM. Total 500 data points are generated using numerical simulations considering variations in thermophysical properties of PCM. The five machine learning models used in this study are Random forest regression, Extra trees regression, Gradient boosting regression, Extreme Gradient boosting regression, and Catboost regression. The results indicate that Gradient boosting regression is the best-performing model compared to other machine learning models. An artificial neural network is used as a deep learning approach for predicting the MKR index. The ANN-based model performed best among all five machine learning models and proved its efficacy in training, testing, and sensitivity analysis with the independent dataset.",
          "One of the biggest challenges is towards ensuring large-scale integration of photovoltaic systems into buildings. This work is aimed at presenting a building integrated photovoltaic system power prediction concerning the building's various orientations based on the machine learning data science tools. The proposed prediction methodology comprises a data quality stage, machine learning algorithm, weather clustering assessment, and an accuracy assessment. The results showed that the application of linear regression coefficients to the forecast outputs of the developed photovoltaic power generation neural network improved the PV power generation's forecast output. The final model resulted from accurate forecasts, exhibiting a root mean square error of 4.42% in NN, 16.86% in QSVM, and 8.76% in TREE. The results are presented with the building facade and roof application such as flat roof, south facade, east facade, and west facade.",
          "Data-driven models have become increasingly prominent in the building, architecture, and construction industries. One area ideally suited to exploit this powerful new technology is building performance simulation. Physics-based models have traditionally been used to estimate the energy flow, air movement, and heat balance of buildings. However, physics-based models require many assumptions, significant computational power, and a considerable amount of time to output predictions. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) with prefabricated or simulated data are likely to be a more feasible option for environmental analysis conducted by designers during the early design phase. Because ANNs require fewer inputs and shorter computation times and offer superior performance and potential for data augmentation, they have received increased attention for predicting the surface solar radiation on buildings. Furthermore, ANNs can provide innovative and quick design solutions, enabling designers to receive instantaneous feedback on the effects of a proposed change to a building's design. This research introduces deep learning methods as a means of simulating the annual radiation intensities and exposure level of buildings without the need for physics-based engines. We propose the CoolVox model to demonstrate the feasibility of using 3D convolutional neural networks to predict the surface radiation on building facades. The CoolVox model accurately predicted the radiation intensities of building facades under different boundary conditions and performed better than ARINet (with average mean square errors of 0.01 and 0.036, respectively) in predicting the radiation intensity both with (validation error = 0.0165) and without (validation error = 0.0066) the presence of boundary buildings.",
          "The authors present the first on-site investigation of artificial intelligence (AI)-integrated three-dimensionally movable kinetic facade (KF). Despite continued architectural interest on the KF to improve indoor visual comfort, its in-situ operational strategy has been little addressed. To examine our primary hypothesis that the adaptive KF controlled by AI models improves indoor daylight probability (DGP) in real time, we developed an electromagnetic hexagonal KF mechanism, and three machine-learning (ML) regressors (eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest (RFR), Decision Tree) were implemented on a Raspberry Pi board to control the KF (width = 1.73 m, height = 1.1 m). 20,000 data from Radiance were used for model construction, and illuminance sensors were installed for on-site validation in a private office mockup. The facade shape was optimally morphed every 90s, using differential evolution. In the verification, XGB showed the greatest accuracy (R2 = 91.2%) with decent prediction time efficiency (mu = 0.58 s), but the RFR accuracy (R2 = 79.8%) slightly outperformed XGB in the field.",
          "Modeling the photovoltaic (PV) energy output with high accuracy is essential for predicting and analyzing the performance of a PV system. In the particular cases of building-integrated and building-attached photovoltaic systems (BIPV and BAPV, respectively) the time-varying partial shading conditions are a relevant added difficulty for modeling the PV power conversion. The availability of laser imaging detection and ranging (LIDAR) data to create very-high-resolution elevation digital models can be effectively used for computing the shading at high resolution. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) has been used to model the power generation of different BIPV arrays on a 5 min basis using the meteorological and solar irradiance on-site conditions, as well as the shading patterns estimated from a digital surface model as inputs. The ANN model has been validated using three years of 5-min-basis monitored data showing very high accuracy (6-16% of relative error depending on the facade). The proposed methodology combines the shading computation from a digital surface model with powerful machine learning algorithms for modeling vertical PV arrays under partial shading conditions. The results presented here prove also the capability of the machine learning techniques towards the creation of a digital twin for the specific case of BIPV systems that complements the conventional monitoring strategies and can be used in the diagnosis of performance anomalies.",
          "The aim of this study is to compare vibration exposure to noise exposure from railway traffic in terms of equal annoyance, i.e., to determine when a certain noise level is equally annoying as a corresponding vibration velocity. Based on questionnaire data from the Train Vibration and Noise Effects (TVANE) research project from residential areas exposed to railway noise and vibration, the dose response relationship for annoyance was estimated. By comparing the relationships between exposure and annoyance for areas both with and without significant vibration exposure, the noise levels and vibration velocities that had an equal probability of causing annoyance was determined using logistic regression. The comparison gives a continuous mapping between vibration velocity in the ground and a corresponding noise level at the facade that are equally annoying. For equivalent noise level at the facade compared to maximum weighted vibration velocity in the ground the probability of annoyance is approximately 20% for 59 dB or 0.48 mm/s, and about 40% for 63 dB or 0.98 mm/s.",
          "Adaptive Facades (AFs) have proven to be effective as a building envelope that can enhance energy efficiency and thermal comfort. However, evaluating the performance of these AFs using the current building performance simulation (BPS) tools is complex, time-consuming, and computationally intensive. These limitations can be overcome by using a machine learning (ML) model as a method to assess the AF system efficiently during the early design stage. This study presents an alternative approach using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that can predict the hourly cooling loads of AF in significantly less time compared to BPS. To construct the model, a generative parametric simulation of office tower spaces with an AF shading system were simulated in terms of energy consumption using Honeybee add-on in Grasshopper which are linked to EnergyPlus for training the ANN model. The prediction results showed a highly accurate model that can estimate cooling loads within seconds.",
          "Urban built environments have grown dramatically worldwide in the past few decades due to rapid economic and population growths. The potential utilization of renewable resources is highly desirable for a healthy urban environment. Hence, urban wind energy exploration has captured increasing attention from urban planners, architects, engineers, and researchers for the sustainable growth of urban environments and the well-being of urban dwellers. Advances in technologies in the design and installation of wind energy systems in buildings are paving the way to enhance wind energy generation in urban environments. This article presents a perspective of wind energy exploration based on building and urban aerodynamics.

          "This paper focuses on using evolutionary algorithms during conceptual stages of design process for multi-criteria optimisation of building envelopes. An experiment is carried out in optimising a panelled building envelope. The design scenario for the experiment is based on the scenario described in Shea et al. (2006) for the building envelope of the Media Centre Building in Paris. However, in their research, the optimisation process only allowed panel configuration to be optimised. In this paper, the task is to approach the optimisation of the envelope of the same building, assuming it to be in the early phases of the design process. The space of possible solutions is therefore assumed to be much wider, and as a result both external building form and internal layout of functional activities are allowed to vary. The performance intent of the experiment remains the same as that of Shea et al. (2006), which was to maximise daylight and minimise afternoon direct sun hours in the building at certain specific locations.",
          "To predict the response of masonry buildings to various types of loads, engineers use finite element models, specifically solid-element and macro-element models. For predicting masonry responses to seismic events in particular, equivalent frame models-a subcategory of macro-element models-are a common choice because of their low computational cost. However, an existing bottleneck in modeling pipelines is generating the geometry of the model, which is currently a slow and laborious process that is done manually using computer-aided design tools. In this paper, we address this by automating the modelling process using recent advancements in computer vision and machine learning. We present an image-based end-to-end pipeline that automatically generates finite element meshes for solid-element and equivalent-frame models of the outer walls of free-standing historical masonry buildings. As the input, our framework requires RGB images of the buildings that are processed using structure-from-motion algorithms, which create 3D geometries, and convolutional neural networks, which segment the openings and their corners. These layers are then combined to generate level of detail models. We tested our pipeline on structures with irregular surface geometries and opening layouts. While generating the solid element mesh from the level of detail model is straightforward, generating equivalent frame models required algorithms for segmenting the facade and the meshing. Experts in the field analyzed the generated equivalent frame models and determined them to be useful for numerical modeling. These finite element geometries will be invaluable for future predictions of the seismic response of damaged and undamaged buildings. The codes and dataset are publicly available for future studies and benchmarking ( and ).",
          "Electrochromic (EC) glazing reduces the cooling load via solar radiation shielding. However, excessive solar radiation shielding increases the heating load. In other words, the energy-saving effect of EC glazing is dependent on the energy performance of the building. This study compares the heating and cooling loads reduction effects of static and EC glazing under various conditions to evaluate the regional applicability of EC glazing in Japan. Furthermore, to maximize the effect, we employ a machine learning (ML)-based operation and evaluate its efficiency. A parametric study is conducted based on a standard office model in Japan using the DesignBuilder software. The result shows that the heating and cooling loads reduces by 17.1% compared with low-E glazing in warm climates (Miyazaki, Zone 7). However, in cold climates (Obihiro, Zone 2), the energy increase is 25.4% and the trend of the effect changes near Zone 4. Therefore, on days when the heating load is expected to occur in Zones 3-5, we incorporate solar heat before working hours. The results show that reduction in heating and cooling loads of 2-3% can be expected and that the operation schedule can be set accurately via ML.",
          "An accurate estimation of the extreme wind pressure acting on glazed panels is essential for the wind-resistant design of buildings. The traditional time-length-velocity (TVL) approach is severely dependent on the determination of the TVL factors and the selection of single-point measurement tap. To overcome the difficulties, this study aims to generate a generalized model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to reconstruct the super-resolution pressure distributions from low-resolution pressure measurements at different wind directions. The constraint represented by the pressure gradient are embedded in the loss function of the CNN to enable the model to generate real pressure distribution characteristics. By spatially averaging the super-resolution distri-butions, the peak space-averaged pressure on the glazed panels could be finally predicted. On the basis of a rectangle-section high-rise building, the regions near the top corner and near the middle-height under different wind directions are focused on. Results show that the pressure peaks computed from the super-resolution distributions can provide more accurate and robust representations for the true area-averaged peaks, compared with the traditional TVL method. The generalization ability of the pressure gradient guided SRCNN is systematically investigated among different pressure modes and flow patterns influenced by the incident angles.",
          "With an ever-increasing population, there is a sharp increase in the demand for residential areas. This has resulted in high-rise residential towers with building facades having balconies that not only serve utilitarian and aesthetic purposes but also provide air circulation and ventilation. Hence balconies become an important passive component to control the heat gain by the building. This paper investigates the effect of the geometry of the balcony and the material used for construction on the heat gain by the internal space, optimizing the cooling load. This study gauges the effect of various designs of building facades in terms of balcony geometry and material using Energy Plus and MATLAB-based neural network modeling. We use a surrogate model to predict simulation results and run various material properties to find the optimum material properties and the geometry of the balcony. We assume the balcony area to be fixed and find an optimum design using surrogate modeling. The results of this research can significantly reduce the energy consumption of high-rise buildings by keeping them cool.",
          "Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV), based on tandem PV cells, is considered a new alternative for combining solar energy with buildings. Accurately predicting the BIPV-harvested annual output energy (Eout,annual) is crucial for evaluating the BIPV performance. Machine learning (ML) is a potential candidate for solving such a problem without the time-consuming process of experimental investigations. This contribution proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the Eout,annual of 4-terminal perovskite/silicon (psk/Si) PV cells under realistic environmental conditions. The input variables of the proposed model consist of the input solar irradiance (Pin), incident light's angle (Ain), the PV module's temperature (Tmod), the psk absorber's thickness (Thpsk), and the psk absorber's bandgap (Bpsk). The input data were received from the simulated results. This work also evaluates the degree of importance of each input variable and optimizes the architecture of the ANN using the surrogate algorithm before predictions. The optimized ANN-3 (three hidden layers) model shows superior performance indicators, including a mean squared error of MSE = 0.02283, correlation coefficient R = 0.99999, and Willmott's index of agreement Iw = 0.99999. Consequently, the predicted highest Eout,annual at Bpsk of 1.71 eV is 297.73, 115.01, 193.98, and 97.6 kWh/m2 for the rooftop, east, south, and west facades, respectively.",
          "In recent years, advanced control strategies based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) proved to be effective in optimizing the management of integrated energy systems in buildings, reducing energy costs and improving indoor comfort conditions when compared to traditional reactive controllers. However, the scalability and implementation of DRL controllers are still limited since they require a considerable amount of time before converging to a near-optimal solution. This issue is currently addressed in literature through the offline pre -training of the DRL agent. However this solution results in two main critical issues: (1) the need to develop a building surrogate model to perform the training task, and (2) the need to perform a fine-tuning process over several training episodes to obtain a near-optimal control policy.In this context, this paper introduces an Online Transfer Learning (OTL) strategy that exploits two knowledge-sharing techniques, weight-initialization and imitation learning, to transfer a DRL control policy from a source office building to various target buildings in a simulation environment coupling EnergyPlus and Python.A DRL controller based on discrete Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) is trained on the source building to manage the operation of a cooling system consisting of a chiller and a thermal storage. Several target buildings are defined to benchmark the performance of the OTL strategy with that of a Rule-Based Controller (RBC) and two DRL-based control strategies, deployed in offline and online fashion. The strategy adopted for OTL emulates the real world implementation with a simulation process by implementing the transferred DRL agent for a single episode in the target buildings. Target buildings have the same geometrical features and are served by the same energy system as the source building, but differ in terms of weather conditions, electricity price schedules, occupancy patterns, and building envelope efficiency levels. The results show that the OTL strategy can reduce the cumulated sum of temperature violations on average by 50% and 80% respectively when compared to RBC and online DRL while enhancing the energy system operation with electricity cost savings ranging between 20% and 40%. The OTL agent performs slightly worse than the offline DRL controller but it does not require any modeling effort and can be implemented directly on target buildings emulating a real-world implementation.",
          "Strong wind during extreme weather conditions (e.g., strong winds during typhoons) is one of the natural factors that cause the collapse of frame-type scaffolds used in facade work. This study developed an alert system for use in determining whether the scaffold structure could withstand the stress of the wind force. Conceptually, the scaffolds collapsed by the warning system developed in the study contains three modules. The first module involves the establishment of wind velocity prediction models. This study employed various deep learning and machine learning techniques, namely deep neural networks, long short-term memory neural networks, support vector regressions, random forest, and k-nearest neighbors. Then, the second module contains the analysis of wind force on the scaffolds. The third module involves the development of the scaffold collapse evaluation approach. The study area was Taichung City, Taiwan. This study collected meteorological data from the ground stations from 2012 to 2019. Results revealed that the system successfully predicted the possible collapse time for scaffolds within 1 to 6 h, and effectively issued a warning time. Overall, the warning system can provide practical warning information related to the destruction of scaffolds to construction teams in need of the information to reduce the damage risk.",
          "The use of active thermal energy storage can provide energy savings, cost reduction and CO2 mitigation by reducing energy demand for heating and cooling, allowing the use of peak load shifting strategies and enhancing the introduction of renewable energies in the sector. The high investment cost of these systems makes mandatory an appropriate control in order to maximize the energy benefits during its operation. Within this context artificial intelligence techniques have been successfully used to control active thermal energy storage units. This paper uses an experimentally validated numerical tool to study the effect of different control strategies on the performance of one TES system applied to the building sector, a ventilated facade with PCM which uses free cooling. Three different strategies were designed to control the ventilated facade based on cost savings, energy reduction and CO2 mitigation, under different climatic conditions. Results show robust benefits in the three tested control strategies, achieving average savings in comparison to a manual operation of the system of 4.3%, 7.8%, and 16.7%. Moreover, the paper shows that when the control strategy is focused on optimizing cost, the other two benefits claimed by TES systems (energy and CO2 mitigation) are significantly reduced.",
          "The ever-increasing attention towards implementation of environmentally sustainable buildings necessitates the predictions of energy consumption and indoor environmental quality (IEQ) during early design stages. Prefabrication of buildings changes the construction process and components which affects building performance. Better understanding the effects of envelope components on energy performance and IEQ will inform design decisions leading to the creation of more sustainable buildings. In this article multi-objective optimisations of building envelope were carried out by coupling TRNSYS (Transient System Simulation Tool) and jEPlus + EA (EnergyPlus simulation manager for parametrics + Evolutionary Algorithms). The objective functions to be minimised were thermal discomfort hours (TDH), daylight unsatisfied hours (DUH) and life cycle costs (LCC) while maintaining acceptable sound transmission levels and indoor air quality. The decision variables were envelope components of a prefabricated house. Applications for six different climate zones corresponding to eight locations in Australia were investigated. The optimal solution sets were unique for each climate zone. The optimal solutions achieved 27-31% savings in LCC compared to the baseline. The reductions for TDH varied from 6% to 55% among the locations. As a result of trade-offs, the selected compromised solutions in each climate could achieve better reductions for either TDH, LCC or both.",
          "Algal colonization on building facades causes paint defects, structural damages, and adverse effects on the health of occupants. Building managers need to be better informed about the status of the facade to develop effective maintenance programs. This study proposes a soft computing approach for predicting the appearance of algae on building facade with mortar cladding. The proposed approach is established by ensembles of Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system, named as ANFIS-ESM, with random subspace (RSE), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), random linear oracle (RLO), and stacking (STE) strategies. An experimental dataset which consists of 510 historical records and 12 conditioning factors has been collected for this research. Pre-training and post-training analyses on the importance of factors have also been performed by means of mutual information, ReliefF, and Fourier amplitude sensitivity test. Importantly, experimental results point out that STE strategy has attained the most accurate outcome with a classification accuracy rate (CAR) of 87.76% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91. Moreover, the proposed ensemble framework has outperformed other benchmark models including the support vector machine, the random forest, and the rotation forest. Therefore, ANFIS-ESM is a promising tool to assist building managers in establishing maintenance programs.",
          "Computational models capable of generating accurate site metrics for building performance analysis are often limited, complex and time-consuming. To address this gap, a new procedure has been developed with a five-step optimization process relevant to examining urban forms with buildings density constraints, window-to-wall ratio, incident solar radiation and energy production potential in facades. Factors analyzed include floor space intensity (FSI), building height (H), spatial daylight autonomy (sDA), annual sun exposure (ASE) and the effect of facade tilt angles on efficiency targets in cold climates. A myriad of parametric functions has been incorporated in the process through Grasshopper, DIVA, ArchSIM, and evolutionary algorithms in Galapagos. The study revealed effective results of energy production across prominent facade design options. Increasing FSI was found to decrease sDA, for a fixed H. In contrast, increasing H for a fixed FSI decreased sDA with an insignificant magnitude of 4%. The ratio of increase in glazing to increase in sDA was in the order of 1:1.47. Overall, the findings showed novelty in optimizing each facade panel to achieve best performance demonstrated by different urban densities with low/mid/high-rise building conditions. Energy production reached 13 kWh/m(2) with integrated photovoltaics, as a renewable source. High-rise buildings showed the best conceivable energy improvement as opposed to other height conditions. The improvement percentage was observed to be directly proportional to the height difference between the studied building and the surrounding context.",
          "By coupling parametric modelling, building performance (like energy efficiency) simulation, and algorithmic optimization, performance-based generative architectural design (PGAD) can automatically generate lots of high-performance architectural design solutions. Although it is 'performance-based', the final selection of a real design project still needs to consider the aesthetics of design choices. However, due to the overwhelming number of design choices generated by PGAD, it is difficult for designers to choose the most favourable one from them. Therefore, the current study tries to integrate the technology of sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) into the selecting stage of PGAD. Rather than navigating alternatives one from another and getting lost, designers can directly find the most aesthetically preferred one by inputting his/her hand-drawn design. A design project of fenestrating a multiple-floor office building is used to demonstrate this method and test three SBIR algorithms: Angular radial partitioning (ARP), Angular radial orientation partitioning (AROP), and Sketch-A-Net model (SAN). Test results show that AROP performs the best among these three algorithms. Its retrievals are most similar to inquiry images drawn by architects. Meanwhile, performances of AROP with different template combinations are also rated. After that, AROP with the best template is also tested with incompletely drawn inquiry images. In the end, investigation results are validated by another building facade design case. The current study automates the PGAD process stepwise, making it more applicable to real design projects.",
          "Occupant control of venetian blinds or fabric roller shades can have a significant impact on facade solar transmission, with cascading implications for daylight availability, energy reduction and Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ). However, field data describing how occupants operate interior shading devices is extremely limited leading to theoretical assumptions for the position and frequency of operation of shades or the discounting of shading devices entirely in simulation. This paper presents results of a 6-month field study conducted in open-plan daylit offices in a LEED Silver office building located in San Francisco, CA. In total, 78 workspaces were observed over multi-week periods to develop a data set describing the physical environmental conditions associated with shade operations and to collect observations of individual shade configurations. The paper compares observed behavior to existing behavioral models used in simulation and presents single-variable logistic regression models developed from this field data. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of observed shade control behavior for existing approaches to predicting annual daylight availability and solar loads during design and for compliance with energy codes and green building standards.",
          "The increase in global population, which negatively affects energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and arable land, necessitates designing sustainable habitation alternatives. Self-sufficient high-rise buildings, which integrate (electricity) generation and efficient usage of resources with dense habitation, can be a sustainable solution for future urbanisation. This paper focuses on transforming Europoint Towers in Rotterdam into self-sufficient buildings considering energy consumption and food production (lettuce crops) using artificial intelligence. Design parameters consist of the number of farming floors, shape, and the properties of the proposed facade skin that includes shading devices. Nine thousand samples are collected from various floor levels to predict self-sufficiency criteria using artificial neural networks (ANN). Optimisation problems with 117 decision variables are formulated using 45 ANN models that have very high prediction accuracies. 13 optimisation algorithms are used for an in-detail investigation of self-sufficiency at the building scale, and potential sufficiency at the neighbourhood scale. Results indicate that 100% and 43.7% self-sufficiencies could be reached for lettuce crops and electricity, respectively, for three buildings with 1800 residents. At the neighbourhood scale, lettuce production could be sufficient for 27,000 people with a decrease of self-sufficiency in terms of energy use of up to 11.6%. Consequently, this paper discusses the potentials and the improvements for self-sufficient high-rise buildings.",
          "The heating energy consumption in rural residential buildings is increasing in recent years. The 181 influencing factors which influence heating energy consumption mainly includes five parts: family basic information, rural residential building features, building envelope information, indoor air quality in winter and building heating energy consumption. Multiple linear regression analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the significant factors which affect rural building heating energy. Suitable and validated multiple regression model can use less variables to describe, explain and predict the heat energy consumption of rural residential buildings. Comparing different multiple linear regression models, one interactive exponential model which has goodness of fit, less predictive relative error and less influencing factors is optimal. This exponential model can be applied to predict heating energy consumption and annual heating energy consumption of per degree-days heating area of rural buildings. Logistic regression analysis can predict heating energy consumption from high, medium or low probability prediction classification and can evaluate the heating energy consumption level. Two regression analysis methods present a reliable, valid, and economical instrument for in-depth rural building energy saving research.",
          "Purpose: Numerous simulation software has been used to evaluate energy performance with 12% of the research focusing on long-term energy consumption prediction. This paper aims to utilize machine learning to predict the energy performance of building envelope wall materials over extended periods. Methodology: In our work, machine learning model learns from a large set of building envelopes simulated using the Integrated Environmental Solutions Virtual Environment as follows: Findings: Machine Learning models can also be used to predict the impact of building design and construction characteristics on energy consumption, showing that factors such as wall thickness, orientation, and thermal mass indicated lower relative standard error (<0.001); however, not all of them were statistically significant (p > 0.05). While the overall model indicates statistical significance (p = 2e-16), the multivariate linear regression model produces R2 value of 0.42, indicating a weak relationship between predictor variables and target attributes. Originality: The utilisation of Random forest algorithm for the wall envelop energy consumption Research implecation: different to other techniques, our proposed approach addressed the issue related to building envelop for new constructions to assist professional from construction industry.",
          "Thermally anisotropic building envelope (TABE) is a novel active building envelope that can save energy use to maintain thermal comfort in buildings by redirecting heat and coolness from building envelopes to thermal loops. Finite element models (FEMs) can be used to compute the heat fluxes through TABEs, but the high computational cost of finite element simulations has prevented parametric studies and design optimizations. This paper proposes a domain knowledge-informed, finite element-based machine learning framework to reduce the computation cost for the energy management of buildings installed with TABE that uses a ground thermal loop. First, the training heat flux data set was generated by FEM simulations with different thermal loop schedules. Then, both shallow learning models (i.e., multivariate linear regression and eXtreme Gradient Boost, or XGBoost) and a deep learning model (i.e., deep neural network, or DNN) were trained to predict the heat fluxes. Domain knowledge was used for data preprocessing and feature selection. Finally, the suitability of the selected machine learning model was tested under different thermal loop schedules. The case study results showed that: (1) XGBoost can be as accurate as DNN (coefficient of determination equal to 0.81) with much less training time; (2) the annual energy cost savings for different thermal loop schedules obtained by the XGBoost-predicted and FEMcalculated heat fluxes are consistent, having a difference of only 4%; and (3) XGBoost can reduce the computation time for the annual energy analysis of the case study building with a given thermal loop schedule from around 12 h by using FEM to less than 1 min.",
          "Application of Machine Learning (ML) in the field of architecture is a worthwhile topic to discuss in the context of digital architecture. Authors propose to extend this discussion, presenting an integrated ML pipeline built with the state-of-the-art data science tools. To investigate the affordances of such pipelines, an ML model being able to predict the environmental metrics of a generalized facade system is created. This approach is valid for arbitrary facades, as long as the proposed design could be discretized in the form analogous to the data generated for the ML model training. The presented experiment evaluates the precision of the sunlight hours and radiation values predictions, aiming at the application in the early design phases. Conducted investigation builds up on the knowledge embedded in the Grasshopper and Ladybug toolsets. Potential application of Convolutional Neural Networks and categorical datasets for classifications tasks to increase the precision of the ML models have been identified. Possibility to extend the approach beyond the workspace of Rhino and Grasshopper is suggested. Further research outlook, investigating the data pattern recognition capabilities in relation to the three-dimensional forms discretized as multidimensional arrays, is stated.",
          "The building envelope considerably influences building energy consumption. To enhance the energy efficiency of buildings, this paper proposes an approach to predict building energy consumption based on the design of the building envelope. The design parameters of the building envelope include the comprehensive heat transfer coefficient and solar radiation absorption coefficient of exterior walls, comprehensive heat transfer coefficient and solar radiation absorption coefficient of the roof, comprehensive heat transfer coefficient of outer windows, and window-wall ratio. The approach is applied to optimize the design parameters of the building envelope structure of a university teaching building in northern China. First, a building information model of a teaching building is established in Revit and imported into DesignBuilder energy consumption analysis software. Subsequently, a data set of the abovementioned 6 parameters is obtained by performing orthogonal testing and energy consumption simulations. On this basis, an RF model is used to predict building energy consumption and rank the importance of each parameter, and the Pearson function is used to evaluate the corresponding correlations. The results show that the most important parameters with the highest correlations to building energy consumption are the comprehensive heat transfer coefficients of the exterior walls and outer windows and the window-wall ratio. Finally, the RF prediction results are compared to the prediction results of a BP artificial neural network (BP-ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The findings indicate that the RF model exhibits notable advantages in building energy consumption prediction and is the optimal prediction model among the compared models. ",
          "Aligning the European Union goals for climate neutrality by 2050 and the ambition for carbon equivalent emissions reduction to almost half by 2030 demands the exploration of alternative decarbonisation pathways. Energy consumption across all sectors is identified as a crucial contributor to this challenge, with a number of legislative and regulatory frameworks and commitments to be introduced every year. In response to these trends, the concept of exploiting a building's thermal mass through the integration of phase change materials (PCMs) enhances the ability of building elements to reserve and deliver large amounts of energy during phase transitions. However, the incorporation of PCMs into building elements requires the thorough understanding of their thermal behaviour. This study evaluates and predicts the thermophysical properties of mineral particles carrying PCMs and coated with a cementitious layer able to be utilised as fillers in construction applications. By employing deep learning and predictive modelling techniques, the numerical data-driven model developed in this paper enhances accuracy and efficiency in property estimation and prediction, facilitating material selection, system design, and optimisation. A model in a MATLAB simulation environment is presented, evaluating and predicting the thermophysical properties of semi-organic particles able to enhance building envelope thermal mass as a hybrid energy storage solution. These findings show the time needed for a building block to undergo cooling, demonstrating a clear upgrade in the thermal discharge of the walls. Substituting traditional EP with PCM-enhanced EP leads to a minimum reduction of 1 & DEG;C per hour in the discharge rate, thereby extending the comfort duration of indoor spaces without necessitating additional space heating. These models offer the potential for assessing diverse material compositions and usage scenarios, offering valuable insights to aid decisions in optimizing building energy efficiency.",
          "The Singapore government emphasises the importance of sustainable development of the country and set an ambitious target for the adoption of solar power in 2014. Though solar energy is the most promising renewable energy source for Singapore, there is insufficient space for large scale PV panels deployment and hence PV systems have to be integrated into the building environment. Urban morphology determines the effectiveness of PV panels in the urban environment and hence it is important to design the new developments carefully. However, there is a lack of tool and knowledge to estimate the solar energy potential of a new planning zone, so this study developed morphological based PV output and energy consumption predictive models to identify the urban form for effective PV systems deployment by multilinear regression. Three equations are built for predicting the building cooling energy consumption, PV generation on rooftop and facade and the R-2 of these three equations are 0.33, 0.44 and 0.48 respectively. The regression equations show that the urban setting for maximizing PV generation and minimizing cooling energy consumption is different. Furthermore, the low R-2 values of the three equations reflects that building the predictive models by linear regression may not be the most suitable option and other machine learning algorithms should be explored.",
          "Multi-functional kinetic facades have great potential to adapt to the environment, reduce building energy consumption, regulate shading and natural ventilation, and improve human thermal and visual comfort. However, due to their complex nature, kinetic facades systems are often associated with highly onerous time-consuming design and fabrication processes, which significantly limit their diffusion and market uptake. This research aims to propose an integrated, systematic framework that supports kinetic facades' performance design and decision making since projects' early design stages. The proposed method makes use of Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEA) which have proven successful in providing optimum solutions for complex problems. The efficacy of the framework is then validated based on a case study analysis to improve daylighting performance in an office building context. The results indicate that the integration of the proposed framework can provide a variety of data to support performance evaluation and to identify the most efficient kinetic facades solutions; moreover, this method provided a variety of optimal solutions using Pareto front and the Ranking Method; each being advantageous in a specific set of criteria as evidenced by improved useful daylight illuminance by up to 30%, daylight autonomy by up to 20% while keeping the under-lit and over-lit values as low as under 10%. Finally, future research can focus on the integration of soft computing methods to create a smart and intelligent performance evaluation framework for kinetic facades.",
          "The selection of an optimal building facade system is a challenging process that can be facilitated by using decision-analysis methods. However, current commonly-used decision-analysis tools in civil engineering cannot deal with the interactions among multiple design criteria. The Choquet integral is the only well-known method capable of accounting for such interactions. However, the process of assigning the fuzzy measures (importance weights) for this method is complex, particularly when there is a large number of criteria be considered. This paper proposes two supervised methods to estimate these fuzzy measures. The first method estimates the relative importance weights by using a statistical approach based on Principal Component Analysis, while the second method is elicited from a machine learning algorithm using Neural Networks. These two methods are used in an illustrative example to find the fuzzy measures related to facade design with respect to four criteria; and their merits and limitations are discussed.",
          "The objective of this study was to develop a prediction model for predicting the mould growth risk in wood-frame walls. A machine learning algorithm, the Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression was used for developing the model. Hygmthermal simulations were performed for a wood-frame wall with brick cladding using hourly historical and projected future climate data for cities located in different climate zones across Canada. The mould index calculated at the exterior layer of OSB was used as the response variable in the PLS model and the most relevant climate parameters were used as inputs including: temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind-driven rain, and solar radiation normal to the facade. The model was trained using a training set comprising two climate periods and different wall orientations for three cities. It was then used to predict the mould index for other years and wall orientations without performing the simulations. The coefficient of determination (R-2), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was used to evaluate the model's accuracy. Also, ranking and mould risk category analysis were carried out to assess the model's ability to rank the years according to their moisture severity. Results showed that with proper selection of training dataset, the model can be effectively used to predict the hygrothermal performance of brick-clad wood-frame wall assemblies in the selected cities and over both historical and future climates.",
          "Individual comfort is one necessary dimension from which to evaluate the indoor visual and thermal environment. However, the study of real-time, noncontact measurements of personal thermal comfort and the corresponding control system is not comprehensive. This paper aims to propose a workflow to design an adaptive facade that considers occupants' glare and thermal discomfort. From 280 valid questionnaires, the correlation between 13 defined postures and glare and thermal discomfort was determined. A CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is introduced to build a model to identify user behaviours. By taking the key point coordinates parsed by the OpenPose algorithm as input, the CNN-based model can recognize the 13 defined postures and a Sitting  type. An adaptive facade control system is proposed based on the captured occupant postures and spatial position. Validation results from volunteers showed that the CNN-based model could recognize user postures and respond immediately. After training for 40 epochs using 1260 videos as the training set, a model with 0.121 cross-entropy loss on the validation set was selected, and its accuracy reached 91.67% in the test. The adaptive facade units and the HVAC system are dynamically adjusted based on the extracted discomfort states. The set opening factor changes in steps of 0.1, and the set temperature of the HVAC system changes in steps of 1 degrees C at 15 min intervals. This allows the potential to build a personalized visual and thermal environment, which helps to improve the visual and thermal comfort of occupants.",
          "This study examined the personal characteristics and preferences of individuals that encourage interactions with smart media displays (media facades). Specifically, it aimed to determine which key aspects of a smart display media facade enhance intuitive interactions. A range of smart display technologies and their effects on interaction decisions were considered. Data were drawn from a survey of 200 randomly sampled residents and/or visitors to a smart building, One Central Park, in Sydney, Australia. A binomial logistic regression analysis was undertaken to establish links between a range of design, perceptions and socio-demographic variables and individuals' decisions to interact with a smart media display. The results showed that the aesthetics of an installation, the quality of an installation's content and the safety of the operation-friendly environment significantly affected respondents' decisions to interact with the media display. Interestingly, respondents born overseas were more likely to interact with a smart display than those born in Australia. Respondents who expressed a preference for photograph-based interactions were also more likely to interact with the display. Somewhat surprisingly, age, residency and levels of familiarity with digital technology did not significantly affect respondents' decisions to interact with the display.",
          "Electric lighting energy expenses has gained importance in the last decades representing a large part of the global energy expense worldwide. The increase of the proportion of glazed building facades is an incomplete solution raising other problems regarding thermal and visual comfort, while rebound effects in terms of lighting usage lowered the energetic benefits of LED technology. Another strategy to address the issue of energy is the well-known strategy of the re-introduction of task lights. The current study presents a system arbitrating the contribution of daylight with general and task electric lighting from the prediction of key performance indicators (work plane illuminance and daylight glare probability) by a machine learning model. It aims at reducing energy consumption while minimizing the impact on occupants' comfort and productivity. This system was validated by the mean of a controlled user experiment with 60 participants. Altogether, our data revealed that RADIANCE simulations model accurately predicts on-site monitoring (R2 = .96) and that the machine learning model accurately predicts RADIANCE simulations for both work plane illuminance (R2 = .99) and daylight glare probability (R2 = .99) allowing to operate the automated system. Data from the user experiment shows that our system successfully saves 35 Wh on average compared to manual operation of the room by users, by making prior use of daylight and task lighting. This represents more than halving the energy demand. Importantly, the automation impacted neither users' comfort or task performance. System acceptance constructs such as system reliability or trust in the system were found to be linked with an attribution of the locus of control to powerful others. This result suggests that the key towards high user acceptance might lie in purposefully addressing this dimension. Altogether, the presented results support the potential for energy saving through the development of user-centred lighting automation.",
          "Building energy-saving retrofitting has become an essential way for the building sector to cope with cli-mate change. Furthermore, climate change affects building retrofit strategies. The current building stock is massive, which means there is a large demand for building retrofitting. Additionally, climatic conditions are changing, posing a significant challenge to the current time-consuming and labor-intensive decision-making process. To solve these problems, a dynamic intelligent building decision-making model was established in this study. The static and dynamic features of building retrofit decision-making were identified, four machine learning algorithms were considered, and a case base containing records for 301 retrofitted buildings was established for knowledge mining. The findings demonstrate that the XGBoost algorithm performs well in terms of building retrofit strategy prediction, with 77% accuracy for the prediction of building envelope retrofits and 76% accuracy for the prediction of HVAC system retrofits. In addition, the trends of building retrofit strategy decision-making considering dynamic climate conditions were observed. The demand for building envelope retrofitting and heating retrofitting has declined, while the demand for cooling retrofitting has increased. Some buildings are extremely sensitive to climate change, and some redundant retrofitting strategies should be avoided. The proposed intelligent decision-making model can provide valuable information for future building retrofit strategy decision-making.",
          "One of the primary aims of performance-oriented design is to develop spaces that achieve acceptable levels of human comfort. Wind-induced airflow plays a significant role in improving occupants' comfort in a building. This paper explores the extent to which simulation and evaluation of natural airflow can potentially be a contributing parameter in the conception of performance-aware designs. The authors employed Fast Fluid Dynamics simulation to study the natural ventilation performance of a pavilion and a genetic algorithm to optimize the shape of the pavilion's facades' openings. A performance analysis was conducted whereby an array of automated feedback loops carried out by a genetic algorithm produce a number of acceptable solutions. Hence the facade openings of these solutions are considered to be adequate to provide natural ventilation in the indoor environment. The study demonstrates the ability of the optimization model to yield design instances that fulfill a number of environmental criteria related to airflow and human comfort. In this light, the authors suggest that the aforementioned method can be used as an experimentation platform to influence and guide the designer during the initial stages of the design process towards a more performance-driven solution.",
          "Novel wood-plastic composites (WPC) have been on the market as facade panels for years, but they are rarely used. This study surveyed both building planners and laypersons about their attitude towards WPC facades and their willingness to apply them in commercial or private projects. By means of 24 items on product attributes, significant and measurable effects were identified by logistic regression analysis and categorised according to the theory of planned behaviour. Significantly different attitude characteristics were found for most of the items tested. It was shown that experts are strongly influenced by corporate-normative factors and base their decisions on fewer criteria, mainly from the field of product certification. Laypersons, on the other hand, are oriented on far more aspects regarding product and manufacturer. Experience with WPC was not an issue for both groups. The results guide manufacturers towards a more target group-specific product development.",
          "Visual design is associated with the use of some basic design elements and principles. Those are applied by the designers in the various disciplines for aesthetic purposes, relying on an intuitive and subjective process. Thus, numerical analysis of design visuals and disclosure of the aesthetic value embedded in them are considered as hard. However, it has become possible with emerging artificial intelligence technologies. This research aims at a neural network model, which recognizes and classifies the design principles over different domains. The domains include artwork produced since the late 20th century; professional photos; and facade pictures of contemporary buildings. The data collection and curation processes, including the production of computationally-based synthetic dataset, is genuine. The proposed model learns from the knowledge of myriads of original designs, by capturing the underlying shared patterns. It is expected to consolidate design processes by providing an aesthetic evaluation of the visual compositions with objectivity.",
          "An overview of commonly used methodologies based on the artificial intelligence approach is provided with a special emphasis on neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms. A description of selected applications to building energy systems of AI approaches is outlined. In particular, methods using the artificial intelligence approach for the following applications are discussed: Prediction energy use for one building or a set of buildings (served by one utility), Modeling of building envelope heat transfer, Controlling central plants in buildings, and Fault detection and diagnostics for building energy systems.",
          "Transmission losses through the building envelope account for a large proportion of building energy balance. One of the most important parameters for determining transmission losses is thermal transmittance. Although thermal transmittance does not take into account dynamic parameters, it is traditionally the most commonly used estimation of transmission losses due to its simplicity and efficiency. It is challenging to estimate the thermal transmittance of an existing building element because thermal properties are commonly unknown or not all the layers that make up the element can be found due to technical-drawing information loss. In such cases, experimental methods are essential, the most common of which is the heat-flux method (HFM). One of the main drawbacks of the HFM is the long measurement duration. This research presents the application of deep learning on HFM results by applying long-short term memory units on temperature difference and measured heat flux. This deep-learning regression problem predicts heat flux after the applied model is properly trained on temperature-difference input, which is backpropagated by measured heat flux. The paper shows the performance of the developed procedure on real-size walls under the simulated environmental conditions, while the possibility of practical application is shown in pilot in-situ measurements.",
          "Rainstorm damage caused by the malfunction of urban drainage systems and water intrusion due to defects in the building envelope can be considerable. Little research on this topic focused on the collection of damage data, the understanding of damage mechanisms and the deepening of data analysis methods. In this paper, the relative contribution of different failure mechanisms to the occurrence of rainstorm damage is investigated, as well as the extent to which these mechanisms relate to weather variables. For a case study in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, a property level home insurance database of around 3100 water-related damage claims was analysed. The records include comprehensive transcripts of communication between insurer, insured and damage assessment experts, which allowed claims to be classified according to their actual damage cause. The results show that roof and wall leakage is the most frequent failure mechanism causing precipitation-related claims, followed by blocked roof gutters, melting snow and sewer flooding. Claims related to sewer flooding were less present in the data, but are associated with significantly larger claim sizes than claims in the majority class, i. e. roof and wall leakages. Rare events logistic regression analysis revealed that maximum rainfall intensity and rainfall volume are significant predictors for the occurrence probability of precipitation-related claims. Moreover, it was found that claims associated with rainfall intensities smaller than 7-8mm in a 60-min window are mainly related to failure processes in the private domain, such as roof and wall leakages. For rainfall events that exceed the 7-8mmh(-1) threshold, the failure of systems in the public domain, such as sewer systems, start to contribute considerably to the overall occurrence probability of claims. The communication transcripts, however, lacked information to be conclusive about to which extent sewer-related claims were caused by overloading of sewer systems or failure of system components.",
          "Several substantial market barriers obstruct the widespread adoption of sustainable buildings. Esthetic features are amongst the main driving forces behind the marketability of buildings, thus improvement of sustainable buildings in terms of visual esthetics would enhance their marketability and thus their market intake. Nonetheless, esthetic improvement of the buildings is a challenging task because it lacks in scales and methods to measure and evaluate buildings' facade esthetic. In this regard, this study aims to develop machine learning-based models to predict the esthetic appreciation of buildings related to their facade features. For this purpose, an artificial neural network and decision tree models are developed and validated with the results of a conducted comprehensive survey (n = 807). In addition, the impact of different window features (i.e., position, number, area, width, height, symmetry, and proportion) on housings esthetic and marketability is investigated. Results show a high level of accuracy for both models in the prediction of esthetic appreciation of buildings. ",
          "This Dataset provides a method of optimizing robot arm, facade pick and place locations in the construction site during facade assembly activity using generative design. A set of generative algorithms are provided in the form of graphical algorithm editors. The dataset is divided into three sets, each set controlling an essential subtask of facade assembly in the construction site. the dataset is called (iFOBOT) and consist of the following sub datasets: generative tool for facade population on building envelop (iFOBOT-D), Generative algorithm aided robot spatial location optimizer (iFOBOT-B), and Quantity take-off generative (iFOBOT-L). A sample project associated with its script and outcome results are included in this dataset to guide readers how to use this tool. This dataset only focuses on robot arm and facade module placement in construction sites. This dataset can generate optimized location of robot arm workstation in jobsite while also reducing robot collision with its body and surrounding objects, 2) reducing reachability rate, 3) reducing robot time travel during operation which in result minimize risk in facade assembly and increase productivity. This dataset is in parametric format which makes it reusable with all its history data using the reproducing guide provided here. More details of how to reuse this dataset and developed tool in construction site is covered in Robot-based Facade Spatial Assembly Optimization paper [1] ",
          "Recent advances toward sustainable cities have promoted the concept of near-zero energy consumption. A Positive Energy Building (PEB) model has been developed by the European Union as part of Horizon 2020 to contribute to a cleaner neighborhood environment. To achieve PEB goals, a variety of factors must be optimized, including occupant comfort, building efficiency, economic benefits, and clean energy provision. Building modeling simulation combined with data-driven tools such as machine learning and artificial intelligence can be used to predict energy production and optimize passive and active systems. Based on these findings, this study evaluates studies from the past decade that include data-driven approaches, which accelerate different aspects of PEB, including supply and demand. These aspects include renewable energy supply prediction with the local context, optimizing comfort control with IoT, and reducing demand by optimizing building envelope design, materials selection, and active systems. While there are a few surveys regarding renewable energy management and energy efficiency in buildings, none simultaneously classified the algorithms in a PEB framework. Hence, this work inherently creates a technical framework for future researchers and building engineers to apply the appropriate data-driven approach for achieving net positive energy performance in residential, educational, and commercial buildings. Finally, comparing different applications suggests future research problems that can be addressed by integrating optimization algorithms and machine learning approaches, as well as data gaps that can be resolved to improve prediction accuracy.",
          "The durability of constructions is essential to the quality of life in urban spaces. Recently there has been a growing concern of the construction stakeholders with the durability of the materials used and construction sustainability. In this study, using a multinomial logistic regression technique, a probabilistic analysis of the degradation condition of rendered facades, as a function of age and type of mortar, is performed. The probability of the rendered facades reaching the end of their service life, i.e. the moment after which they no longer comply with the minimum performance requirements, is also evaluated. To that purpose, a sample of 100 case studies located in Lisbon, whose degradation state is determined by in situ visual inspections, is used.",
          "Microbial disfigurement of coated wooden surfaces is considered a major maintenance concern and will shorten the aesthetic service life of wooden facades. The effect of the physical surface structure of a paint film when applied on wood may have an impact on the susceptibility to mould growth. Six model paints were formulated to give the following physical surface structures: glossy, matt, soft, hard, hydrophobic, and a film with air inclusion. The model paints and a standard paint, with and without fungicide, were applied on panels of Norway spruce (Picea abies L Karst.) and exposed outdoors for nearly three years according to a modified version of EN 927-3. A logistic regression model was fit to the data, and the degree of mould growth varied with exposure time and type of paint. Hard model paint was significantly more susceptible than the other model paints and had a performance close to the standard paint without fungicide. Soft model paint provided the best performance, with the least mould growth. Temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation did not significantly contribute to the model. ",
          "This paper demonstrates the validation and prediction of the wall temperature of a building exposed to a composite climate. Two artificial intelligence models, such as multiple linear regression and artificial neural networks, have been used to predict. The wall temperature has been predicted mainly based on the parameters like ambient temperature, wind speed and relative humidity in all four directions of the buildings. Three statistical analyses were used to validate the model's outcome: R-Squared, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). In terms of train and control data, the two models yield comparable findings. The artificial neural network model has more adaptability since it was able to adjust to unexpected changes in the input data, according to a comparison of the applied mathematics of each model. The regression model was used for this investigation because it gives constant estimate values for the factors, though the neural model isn't numerically characterized. The review infers that the neural model must be utilized as an additional way to predict the wall temperature. This study can plan and adapt buildings for future work, considering the most critical climatic conditions. It also assists architects and engineers in determining the appropriate insulation for the building envelope, which improves its thermal performance.",
          "Transition towards a carbon-neutral district energy community calls for carbon elimination and offsetting strategies, and phase change materials (PCMs) with substantial potential latent energy density can contribute significantly to carbon neutrality through both carbon-positive (like PCM-based thermal control in solar PVs) and carbon-negative strategies (like waste-to-energy recovery). However, roadmap for PCMs' application in carbon -neutral transition is ambiguous in the current academia, and a state-of-the-art overview on latent thermal storage is necessary. In this study, a comprehensive review was conducted on cutting-edge technologies for carbon -neutral transition with latent thermal storages. Both carbon-positive and carbon-negative strategies in the operational stage are reviewed. Carbon-positive solution mainly focuses on energy-efficient buildings, through a series of passive, active, and smart control strategies with artificial intelligence. Passive strategies, to enhance thermal inertia and thermal storage of building envelopes, mainly include free cooling, solar chimney, solar facade, and Trombe walls. Active strategies mainly include mechanical ventilations, active water pipe-embedded radiative cooling, and geothermal system integration. The ultimate target is to minimise building energy de-mands, with improved utilisation efficiency on natural heating (e.g., concentrated solar thermal energy, geothermal heating, and solar-driven ventilative heating) and cooling resources (e.g., ventilative cooling, geothermal cooling, and sky radiative cooling). As one of the most critical solutions to offset the released carbon emission, carbon-negative strategies with PCMs mainly include cleaner power production and waste heat re-covery. Main functions of PCMs include energy efficiency enhancement on cleaner power production, steady steam production, steady heat flux via the latent storage capacity, and pre-heat purpose on waste heat recovery. A thermal energy interaction network with transportation is formulated with PCMs' recovering heat from in-ternal combustion engines and spatiotemporal energy sharing, to provide frontier research guidelines. Future studies are recommended to spotlight standard testing procedure and database, benchmarks for suitable PCMs selection, seasonal cascaded energy storage, nanofluid-based heat transfer enhancement in PCMs, anti-corrosion, compatibility, thermochemical stability, and economic feasibility of PCMs. This study provides a clear roadmap on developing PCMs for transition towards a carbon-neutral district energy community, together with applica-tions, prospects, and challenges, paving the path for combined efforts from chemical materials synthesis and applications.",
          "Increasing the energy efficiency of the existing building stock can be accomplished by adding thermal insulation to the building envelope. In case of historic buildings with massive walls, internal insulation is often the only feasible post-insulation technique. Drawback of internal insulation is the modified hygrothermal response of the wall, which can result in moisture damage. Hence, it is crucial to assess the risk of damage accurately beforehand. Given the many uncertainties involved, a probabilistic assessment is advisable. This, however, would require thousands of simulations, which easily becomes computationally inhibitive. To overcome this time-efficiency issue, this paper proposes the use of neural networks to replace the original hygrothermal model. The neural network is trained on a small data set obtained from the hygrothermal model and can subsequently be used to predict the hygrothermal behaviour of building components with different boundary conditions and geometry. The transient nature of the hygrothermal behaviour requires a neural network type which can handle long-range time-dependencies. In the past, recurrent neural networks were often used for this type of data. Recently however, results indicate that convolutional neural networks can outperform recurrent neural networks on such tasks. This paper compares the prediction accuracy and training time of both neural network types for the prediction of the hygrothermal behaviour of building components.",
          "Architectural design of a facade, both at the aesthetic point of view and from the point of view of internal daylighting performance of the building, can be considered as a complex task. In this study, we implement a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to formally exploration the process of reconstruction of the education building's facade. The purpose of this research is to create a facade configuration by considering the size and location of elements and their materials when creating a suitable internal daylight distribution. The total construction cost of the building's exterior and the daylight performance of the building's interior are considered as objectives. The problem formulation includes two conflicting objectives, which are to increase daylighting aspect on each floor and reduce the total construction cost of the facade. To detect the approximation of Pareto fronts, including non-dominated solutions, we used a fast and elitist multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). Computational and architectural results show that NSGA-II is efficient enough to demonstrate eligible facade design alternatives.",
          "The capsule tower typology was a well-known visionary architectural idea during the 1960-70s. However, the few materialized projects were criticised mostly due to their use of standard-size capsules and their lack of adaptability to user needs. A new methodology for capsule tower design is proposed by means of the use of a genetic algorithm. in order to emphasise the generative approach of the original projects; it adds area and light optimisation to secure size variation and light comfort. The results show a set of variations in terms of floor layouts, capsule volumes, front facade areas and interstitial spaces amongst modules, which go beyond the uniformity of the earlier strategies. These early findings suggest that this generative approach has the potential of re-examine old design projects by increasing their feasibility and adaptability; this approach also suggests the possibility of combining this concept with additional algorithmic implementations to study other ideas.",
          "Recent Artificial Intelligence studies have achieved substantial improvements in practical tasks by using extensive amounts of data. We assume that a substantial part of the data to guide artificial design technologies resides in existing design examples. Developing ways to use this data may enable improvements in intelligent design tools, with the hope that these may provide more effective design workflows and more productive design practices. Such improvements may result in more in-depth evaluations of potentials and alternatives for design situations; hence better planning for the spatial environment. Various approaches have been developed to use representations of architectural examples for artificially tackling architectural design tasks. This study presents a review of the historical development of these approaches, with an overall aim to investigate where and how design examples have been used for practical computational design applications. The review encompasses traditional and recent Shape Grammar and Procedural Modeling studies, Case-Based Design, Similarity-Based Evaluation and Design, and recent studies on the architectural uses of Machine Vision, Semantic Modeling, Machine Learning, and Classification. The emphasis of the review is on the studies that aim at designing or generating new design examples, particularly for building layouts, facades, envelopes, and massing. For a comparative evaluation of the current capabilities of the examined lineages of studies, we propose a minimum set of design capabilities, and assess each study through this framework. This reveals the overall patterns of already covered requirements. The review shows that initial hand-operated SGs gave way to automatic generation, which in turn developed into automated SG extraction, through increasing levels of computational capabilities. Case Based Design has been neglected; however, it can be reinvigorated through novel Al techniques. On the other hand, Similarity-Based Evaluation may complement and balance the orientation towards technical performance. Machine Learning and Computer Vision appear as potential intermediaries for connecting these threads. There are example-based studies towards almost all aspects of artificial design; yet, these have not been tackled adequately or definitively. In particular, dynamic process control is still only a future potential. On the other hand, the examined research lineages have the potential to assume complementary roles for more capable and multifaceted design systems. As an overall result, example-based research perspectives raise important possibilities for intelligent design systems.",
          "Daylight is important for the well-being of humans. Therefore, many office buildings use large windows and glass facades to let more daylight into office spaces. However, this increases the chance of glare in office spaces, which results in visual discomfort. Shading systems in buildings can prevent glare but are not effectively adapted to changing sky conditions and sun position, thus losing valuable daylight. Moreover, many shading systems are also aesthetically unappealing. Electrochromic (EC) glass in this regard might be a better alternative, due to its light transmission properties that can be altered when a voltage is applied. EC glass facilitates zoning and also supports control of each zone separately. This allows the right amount of daylight at any time of the day. However, an effective control strategy is still required to efficiently control EC glass. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising control strategy that can learn from rewards and penalties and use this feedback to adapt to user inputs. We trained a Deep Q learning (DQN) agent on a set of weather data and visual comfort data, where the agent tries to adapt to the occupant's feedback while observing the sun position and radiation at given intervals. The trained DQN agent can avoid bright daylight and glare scenarios in 97% of the cases and increases the amount of useful daylight up to 90%, thus significantly reducing the need for artificial lighting.",
          "A deep energy retrofit of building envelopes is a vital strategy to reduce final energy use in existing buildings towards their net-zero emissions performance. Building energy modeling is a reliable technique that provides a pathway to analyze and optimize various energy-efficient building envelope measures. However, conventional optimization analyses are time-consuming and computationally expensive, especially for complex buildings and many optimization parameters. Therefore, this paper proposed a novel optimization algorithm, MEVO (metamodel-based evolutionary optimizer), developed to efficiently identify optimal retrofit solutions for building envelopes while minimizing the need for extensive simulations. The key innovation of MEVO lies in its integration of evolutionary techniques with design-of-computer experiments, machine learning, and metaheuristic optimization. This approach continuously refined a machine learning model through metaheuristic optimization, crossover, and mutation operations. Comparative assessments were conducted against four alternative metaheuristic algorithms and Bayesian optimization, demonstrating MEVO's effectiveness in reliably finding the best solution within a reduced computation time. A hypothesis test revealed that the proposed algorithm is significantly better than Bayesian optimization in finding the best cost values. Regarding computation time, the proposed algorithm is 4-7 times faster than the particle swarm optimization algorithm and has a similar computational speed as Bayesian Optimization.",
          "Damp walls of buildings are a serious problem due to the social and economic consequences. Moisture causes accelerated wear of facades, paint coatings, weakening of the wall structure, and high maintenance and renovation costs. The growth of fungi and bacteria worsens the indoor microclimate [1]. Effective identification of moisture inside the walls enables effective preventive actions. The paper presents an algorithmic concept that increases the quality of tomographic images showing the distribution of moisture inside the walls. The method solves the problem of monitoring the dampness of historical buildings and walls susceptible to moisture. The research focuses on solving the inverse problem of converting electrical measurements into spatial images. The study used a proprietary electrical impedance tomography system with specially designed electrodes. The measurement vector is converted to images in two stages. In the first stage, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was used, which generates raw reconstructions. The task of the second LSTM network is to convert the raw images obtained in the first stage into enhanced images. The application of the presented method is not limited to one type of narrow-sphere tomography. The two-stage approach can be easily adapted to, e.g., medical and industrial or process tomography. Therefore, it is a generic, universal method with great implementation potential, which is its great advantage.",
          "Approximately 40% of total energy demand in the European Union is consumed by the residential buildings sector, thus also significantly contributing to carbon dioxide emissions. Circa 28% of this energy demand is attributed to space heating and cooling, primarily influenced by the building's envelope and need to ensure indoor thermal comfort. Given this significant energy consumption, there is an urgent imperative to explore energy-saving strategies and develop tools to assess the effects of various design alternatives, with a focus on wall and roof characteristics. While existing white and black-box predictive models lack generalisation capabilities, the goal of this study is to develop and train a domain-informed grey-box Deep Learning model called Temp-AI -Estimator to predict the indoor temperature of buildings and containers (acting as surrogates for residential or office buildings as well as intermodal containers) based on measurements of external meteorological conditions (e.g. exterior temperature, humidity, etc.), as well as physical properties due to building construction set-ups in questions (ThermoProtect (thin coating), ThermoActive (thick coating) and thermal insulation). The major difficulty lies in making the model generalise beyond the three geographical locations included in the dataset (Berlin, Abu Dhabi, Texel). Experiments with LSTMs and Transformers as baseline models showed overfitting on the particular conditions at the sites in the training set, while failing to generalise to a new out-of-sample location. We propose to pass the model the numerical derivatives of the time-sequences, as these are less location-specific. The estimation of the necessary initial/final conditions is delegated to a very small network to minimise the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, we included a physically motivated module for modelling the latency and difference in amplitudes between exterior conditions and interior temperatures, informed by numerical approximation schemes of the differential equation of thermal conduction. Our experiments show that our domain-informed network achieves an increase in accuracy of almost 40% in addition to yielding results that can easily be inspected by human experts due to interpretability and explainability.",
          "Nearly 75% of EU buildings are not energy-efficient enough to meet the international climate goals, which triggers the need to develop sustainable construction techniques with high degree of resilience against climate change. In this context, a promising construction technique is represented by ventilated facades (VFs). This paper aims to propose three different VFs and the authors define a novel machine learning-based approach to evaluate and predict their energy performance under different boundary conditions, without the need for expensive on-site experimentations. The approach is based on the use of machine learning algorithms for the evaluation of different VF configurations and allows for the prediction of the temperatures in the cavities and of the heat fluxes. The authors trained different regression algorithms and obtained low prediction errors, in particular for temperatures. The authors used such models to simulate the thermo-physical behavior of the VFs and determined the most energy-efficient design variant. The authors found that regression trees allow for an accurate simulation of the thermal behavior of VFs. The authors also studied feature weights to determine the most relevant thermo-physical parameters. Finally, the authors determined the best design variant and the optimal air velocity in the cavity. This study is unique in four main aspects: the thermo-dynamic analysis is performed under different thermal masses, positions of the cavity and geometries; the VFs are mated with a controlled ventilation system, used to parameterize the thermodynamic behavior under stepwise variations of the air inflow; temperatures and heat fluxes are predicted through machine learning models; the best configuration is determined through simulations, with no onerous in situ experimentations needed.",
          "This paper reviews the state-of-the-art smart building research by a bibliometric analysis, a content analysis, and a qualitative review. The bibliometric analysis of 364 academic papers shows that smart building is a burgeoning, interdisciplinary field with a relatively high international collaboration level. Keyword's clustering identified two major themes: (1) IoT, WSN, and cloud computing for automation control and (2) the balance between energy efficiency and human comfort based on continuous monitoring and machine learning. The content analysis statistically detected a transition from the cyber-physical system (CPS) to the human-cyberphysical system (HCPS) in smart building research. We therefore proposed an HCPS framework with three dimensions-cyber-physical scale, human needs, and human roles-to summarize current research and discover potential gaps. Under this framework, five HCPS future research directions for occupants-centered smart buildings were proposed: adaptive building envelope, integrated building management system, enhanced building energy management, adaptive thermal comfort, and microgrid adoption.",
          "Road traffic noise in urban areas is a major source of annoyance. A quiet facade has been hypothesized to beneficially affect annoyance. However, only a limited number of studies investigated this hypothesis, and further quantification is needed. This study investigates the effect of a relatively quiet facade on the annoyance response. Logistic regression was performed in a large population based study (GLOBE, N similar to 18 000), to study the association between road traffic noise exposure at the most exposed dwelling facade (L-den) and annoyance in: (1) The subgroup with a relatively quiet facade (large difference in road traffic noise level between most and least exposed fac, ade (Q > 10 dB); (2) the subgroup without a relatively quiet facade (Q < 10 dB). Questionnaire data were linked to individual exposure assessment based on detailed spatial data (GIS) and standard modeling techniques. Annoyance was less likely (ORQ>10 < ORQ<10) in the subgroup with relatively quiet fac, ade compared to the subgroup without relatively quiet facade. The difference in response between groups seemed to increase with increasing Q and L-den. Results indicate that residents may benefit from a quiet fac, ade to the dwelling. ",
          "This study aims to define the types of composition patterns of contemporary Polish multi-family building facades. The authors define the compositional patterns to determine their frequency. Analyses carried out on the basis of photos and visualizations of 113 examples of architecture from Poland identified groups of common features of facades. Statistical analyses of these features resulted in six types of compositions. Clear differences were noticed in relation to features, such as the repeatability of compositional elements and the method of building a vertical compositional axis. Variations were observed in the frequency and extent of application of specific types of compositions. The results of this study can be a starting point for the development of generative algorithms supporting the process of designing facades. Specifying the types will allow for further exploration of the theme, both in terms of the use of specific compositional measures and in terms of their perception.",
          "In order to obtain information about building daylighting performance earlier in the design stage, recent studies have begun to develop daylight prediction models using machine learning methods. Most studies have adopted design variation parameters as the input parameters for model training, but this method greatly limits the scope of application of the daylight model. By extending application to different design possibilities, this research proposes a novel daylight model, which includes a pre-processing procedure to convert the design model into Intermediary features as input parameters representing daylight penetration performance. By changing geometry of one kind of parametric facade and performing daylighting simulation, we were able to generate the data for training, including Intermediary features and sDA/ASE values. The daylight model was then trained using an artificial neural network. Finally, the proposed daylight model was tested by predicting the daylight performance of other kinds of facades. The results indicated that the value of DA and ASE hours per grid were well predicted and that the daylight distribution was reproduced even with different kinds of facades. The deviations of sDA and ASE from simulation results ranged from 1.7 to 6.1% and 0.3-2.1 h respectively. The reproducibility, the predictive capability, and most importantly the extension of model applicability were all demonstrated for the proposed model. Furthermore, comparing to the daylighting simulation, the method using the proposed daylight model is estimated to save 9/10 daylighting evaluation time. This is critical for implementing the evaluation in the early design stage.",
          "The Digital Transformation offers completely new possibilities for architects and facade designers. Through the application of Artificial Intelligence many design decisions can be made automatically. Since most design tasks are ultimately unique and therefore not operational, fully automatic facade design will not always lead to a satisfactory result. For these reasons, the authors propose a targeted combination of rational (rule-based) and intuitive (poetic) design strategies. The design task is divided into operational subtasks that are processed automatically on the computer and non-operational subtasks that are solved by computers and humans together. A creative and agile design team evaluates different variants proposed by the computer. Promising developments will be pursued and further developed. Then the generative mechanism is adapted and the design is optimized. The concept is refined until a sustainable, user-oriented design is available. However, for the foreseeable future, the solution of non-operational problems will only be possible through human intelligence. The fear that good architecture can be generated at the push of a button and that computers will replace architects and engineers is therefore unfounded.",
          "In 2015, Taiwan's government announced the Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act, the goal of which was a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050, compared with 2005. The residential and commercial sectors produce approximately one third of all carbon emissions in Taiwan, and the number of construction renovation projects is much larger than that of new construction projects. In this paper, we considered the life-cycle CO2 (LCCO2) of a building envelope renovation project in Tainan and focused on local construction methods for typical row houses. The LCCO2 of 744 cases with various climate zones, orientations, and insulation and glazing types was calculated via EnergyPlus, SimaPro, and a local database (LCBA database), and the results were then used to develop a machine learning model. Our findings showed that the machine learning model was capable of predicting annual energy consumption and LCCO2. With regard to annual energy consumption, the RMSE was 227.09 kW center dot h (per year) and the R-2 was 0.992. For LCCO2, the RMSE was 2792.47 kgCO(2)eq and the R-2 was 0.989, which indicates a high-confidence process for decision making in the early stages of building design and renovation.",
          "Algal colonization on facade structure is a common phenomenon which significantly deteriorates the service quality of buildings and may even affect the health of residents. Thus, predicting the colonization progress of algae can be helpful to establish appropriate schedules and methods of building maintenance. This research investigates a machine learning solution for estimating algal colonization growth on mortar surfaces that relies on an artificial neural network (ANN). A data set of 539 experimental data samples has been collected to construct the proposed approaches. The cross-validation process reveals that the ANN has achieved an outstanding prediction performance with the correlation of determination (R2)=0.91 and the root-mean square error (RMSE)=5.69.",
          "Detailed monitoring of loads can provide sufficient information about buildings and help in improving the operation of energy systems. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) has become popular owing to its low cost and lack of disturbance in the occupied space. In this study, NILM methods based on artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) are proposed and compared to obtain the sub-loads of cooling loads. The cooling loads are disaggregated into four sub-loads: occupant load, equipment load, fresh air load, and building envelope load. Results showed both NILM methods could achieve load disaggregation accurately, but the RF-based NILM method performs better than that based on ANN. Moreover, the RF-based NILM method has mean relative errors (MREs) between 2.5% and 13.0%, while the ANN-based NILM method has MREs between 3.1% and 12.9%. Among the four sub-loads, the equipment load could be disaggregated with the highest accuracy. The detailed sub-loads obtained using the proposed NILM methods can guide building renovation and optimization design of building energy systems.",
          "Recent studies showed that deep learning techniques and image processing can identify the distinguishing design principles in architectural facades. However, predicting the strength of a principle is still a challenging task, as it requires a huge amount of annotated design variations. The difficulties in both searching such big numbers of data - and its labelling by experts - slow down the research. This paper proposes a computation approach for obtaining this type of data faster. With the help of parametric modelling and evolutionary algorithms, we could manipulate the design elements, and thereby generate different solutions. An integrated fuzzy logic decision mechanism could enable to carry human knowledge in the judging and labelling of alternatives automatically. The final synthetic data developed from real building images could be used for machine learning applications to enhance our understanding of artistic expression.",
          "Thermal losses through weak building envelope is responsible for global current energy crises. Application of artificial intelligence and drone setups in green buildings can help in providing the sustainable solution the world is striving for years. The contemporary research incorporates a novel concept of measuring the wearing thermal resistances in the building envelope with the aid of a drone system. The above procedure conducts a throughout building analysis by considering three prime environmental parameters such as wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH) and dry bulb temperature (DBT) with the aid of drone heat mapping procedure. The novelty of the study can be interpreted by the fact that prior researches have never explored the building envelope through a combination of drone and climatic conditions as variables in building areas difficult to access, thereby providing an easier, risk free, cost effective and efficient reading. Validation of the formula is authenticated by employing artificial intelligence-based software's which are applied for data prediction and optimization. Artificial models are established to validate the variables for each output from the specified number of climatic inputs. The pareto-optimal conditions attained after analysis are 44.90% RH, 12.61 degrees C DBT and 5.20 km/h WS. The variables and thermal resistance were validated with response surface methodology method, thereby presenting lowest error rate and comprehensive R-2 value, which are 0.547 and 0.97, respectively. Henceforth, employing drone-based technology in estimating building envelope discrepancies with the novel formula, yields consistent and effective assessment for development of green building, simultaneously reducing time and cost of the experimentation.",
          "Different simulation engines are currently required to perform daylight and energy evaluations of complex fenestration systems: Radiance has been validated to evaluate complex geometries but EnergyPlus cannot deal with them, making infeasible the thermal evaluations. The Shading Coefficient method adds an extra step to overcome that limitation: it runs irradiance simulations to create shading schedules that are shared between the simulation engines. This work supports the premise that Solar Energy Density (SED) can be used as a benchmark to evaluate the dual performance of perforated screens (PS). Therefore, only irradiance calculations will be required in evaluations - instead of running three different simulations. Orthogonal Arrays and Principal Component Analysis were the statistical techniques used to select the PS sample and weight the simulation results. The resultant SED thresholds concurrently fostered the accomplishment of daylighting and energy goals, at five different orientations: they maximised the daylit area and minimised the overlit area and total energy use. This work also presents an application example of the single-metric approach to test its effectiveness to perform single-objective optimization of PS design by using Evolutionary Algorithms. The SED approach has the advantage of reducing considerably the simulation time needed to perform the parametric optimization of PS.",
          "Employees' satisfaction and productivity is one of the main interests of employers. Psychological comfort can cause dissatisfaction with their work. Thus, it is important to understand what factors contribute to employees' satisfaction in workplaces. The purpose of this paper is to identify the weight of contribution of each design parameter on increasing psychological satisfaction. The study included 579 employees in five offices in The Netherlands through an online survey. The typologies of offices vary in terms of office layouts, orientations and facade. Additionally, a parameter of desk location was included as this factor may be associated with user satisfaction. Kruskal-Wallis H test, categorical regression, and logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the impact of these design parameters on psychological user satisfaction. The results revealed the impact of design parameters on the psychological satisfaction. The parameters of office layouts and desk locations were the significant predictor factors for the probability of satisfaction variables (e.g. privacy, concentration, communication, social contact and territoriality). The parameters for optimal satisfaction were found in cellular office, north-west oriented workstation and 4 m away from a window. Psychological comfort is an inevitable aspect in user satisfaction studies. This paper, therefore, measures and predicts the relationship between design factors and employees' satisfaction through case studies in The Netherlands. The findings help designers, architects, planners and facility managers to develop user-focussed office design principles supporting employees' work performance.",
          "Harvesting solar energy on rooftops can be a promising solution for providing affordable energy. This requires accurately estimating spatio-temporal solar photovoltaic (PV) potential on urban surfaces. However, it is still a challenge to obtain a fast and accurate estimation of rooftop solar PV potential over large urban built-up areas. Thus, this study proposes a parametric-based method to estimate annual rooftop solar irradiation at a fine spatial resolution. Specifically, seven parameters (Digital Surface Model, Sky View Factor, shadow from buildings, shadow from terrain, building volume to facade ratio, slope, and aspect) are determined that having great importance in modeling rooftop solar irradiation. Three machine learning methods (Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boost Regression Tree (GBRT), and AdaBoost) trained by the selected parameters are cross-compared based on R2, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and computation time. As a case study in Hong Kong, China, the RF outperformed GBRT and AdaBoost, with R2 = 0.77 and MAE = 22.83 kWh/m2/year. The time for training and prediction of rooftop solar irradiation is within 13 h, achieving a 99.32% reduction in time compared to the physical-based hemispherical viewshed algorithm. These results suggest that the proposed method can provide an accurate and fast estimation of rooftop solar irradiation for large datasets.",
          "Integrated life-cycle assessment (LCA) tools have emerged as decision-making support for BIM practitioners during the design stage of sustainable projects. However, differences between methodologies applied for determining the environmental impact of buildings produce significant variations in the results obtained, making them difficult to be compared. In this study, a methodology is defined for generating environmental benchmarks for building typologies through a combination of BIM-based LCA tools and machine learning techniques. When applied to an 11-story residential building typology with 92 dwellings by varying the constructive solutions of facades, partitions, roof and thermal insulation materials, results fall within a range from 360 to 430 kgCO(2)eq/m(2). The Random Forest (RF) algorithm is successfully applied for identifying the most decisive variables in the analysis (partitions and facades), and shows signs of being useful for predicting the environmental impact of future constructions and to be applied to the analysis of greater scale urban zones.",
          "Due to the thermal inertia of building envelope and random uncertainty of occupant behaviors, real-time and accurate forecasting for building cooling and heating loads is not easy to implement. It requires not only favorable modeling methods, but also attention to the intrinsic cause analysis of loads. However, most previous studies have focused more on the improvement of forecasting algorithms, lacking the comprehensive analysis and scientific research from the load formation mechanism. To address this, a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-driven forecasting method integrating building thermal load characteristics, is proposed. This modeling approach takes into account both strong reflection ability of resistance-capacitance (RC) for the thermo-physical characteristics of building envelope and the superior handling capability of dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) for occupant uncertainties. Therewith, the independent building enve-lope model and occupant behavior model are established. Coupling the predicted values of these two sub-models, the building total load forecasting model is established using fuzzy radial basis function (RBF) neural network. A case study of an office building in Tianjin is utilized to validate the proposed method, revealing excellent predictive performance for both the sub-models and the total load model. The proposed method can effectively predict thermal load both from the for-mation mechanism of internal and external disturbances. It was found that the AI-driven model incorporating building thermal load characteristics, achieves significantly higher precision compared to the general data-driven model, with a reduction of 14.74% in coefficient of variation of root mean squared error in summer and 59.78% in winter.",
          "Wet foundations and walls of buildings significantly increase the energy consumption of buildings, and the drying of walls is one of the priority activities as part of thermal modernization, along with the insulation of the facades. This article discusses the research findings of detecting moisture decomposition within building walls utilizing electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and deep learning techniques. In particular, the focus was on algorithmic models whose task is transforming voltage measurements into spatial EIT images. Two homogeneous deep learning networks were used: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory). In addition, a new heterogeneous (hybrid) network was built with LSTM and CNN layers. Based on the reference reconstructions' simulation data, three separate neural network algorithmic models: CNN, LSTM, and the hybrid model (CNN+LSTM), were trained. Then, based on popular measures such as mean square error or correlation coefficient, the quality of the models was assessed with the reference images. The obtained research results showed that hybrid deep neural networks have great potential for solving the tomographic inverse problem. Furthermore, it has been proven that the proper joining of CNN and LSTM layers can improve the effect of EIT reconstructions.",
          "Parametric design and digital fabrication are becoming ubiquitous tools to contemporary architecture and imply a different design process. With this new perception of the contemporary production we have designed a facade sun shade using fractal geometry as a generative system. Fractals are complex shapes generated with simple rules, so it is relatively easy to change the final geometry when we work with parameters. The design process made possible the creation of different options for the brise-soleil using parametric definitions. Some solutions were physically modeled using rapid prototyping, which we consider an essential tool in the contemporary design process. The whole process conducted to the conclusion that architects need to incorporate a new set of skills when working with digital fabrication. Keywords: fractal, design process, generative system, digital fabrication.",
          "Building-Integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) have emerged as a promising sustainable energy solution, relying on accurate energy production predictions and effective decarbonization strategies for efficient deployment. This paper presents a novel approach that combines photogrammetry and deep learning techniques to address the problem of BIPV decarbonization. The method is called BIM-AITIZATION referring to the integration of BIM data, AI techniques, and automation principles. It integrates photogrammetric data into practical BIM parameters. In addition, it enhances the precision and reliability of PV energy prediction by using artificial intelligence strategies. The primary aim of this approach is to offer advanced, data-driven energy forecasts and BIPV decarbonization while fully automating the underlying process. To achieve this, the first step is to capture point cloud data of the building through photogrammetric acquisition. This data undergoes preprocessing to identify and remove unwanted points, followed by plan segmentation to extract the plan facade. After that, a meteorological dataset is assembled, incorporating various attributes that influence energy production, including solar irradiance parameters as well as BIM parameters. Finally, machine and deep learning techniques are used for accurate photovoltaic energy predictions and the automation of the entire process. Extensive experiments are conducted, including multiple tests aimed at assessing the performance of diverse machine learning models. The objective is to identify the most suitable model for our specific application. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is undertaken, comparing the performance of the proposed model against that of various established BIPV software tools. The outcomes reveal that the proposed approach surpasses existing software solutions in both accuracy and precision. To extend its applicability, the approach is evaluated using a building case study, demonstrating its ability to generalize effectively to new building data.",
          "Adaptive envelopes have the potential to significantly reduce energy use in buildings while ensuring high performance. These envelopes interact with multiple interconnected domains, such as daylight, indoor air quality, thermal comfort, and energy use, which can often conflict with one another. Identifying and developing suitable control strategies that can optimally manage the envelope's impact on many domains and avoid sub-optimal operations is an open challenge. Conventional approaches commonly adopted in buildings and building envelope control based on schedules or relatively simple decision trees may be unable to tackle the dynamic behaviour of adaptive envelopes. Due to their complexity, more advanced control approaches based on simulation-informed decision-making are scarce in both research and practice. In this work, we propose a multi-domain model-based control (MBC) algorithm for an adaptive facade concept based on a flexible Double Skin Facade (DSF). The proposed method, which aims for a balanced performance over different comfort domains and energy use, employs a co-simulation approach where the DSF is modelled in a Building Energy Simulation (BES) tool and the control algorithm to manage the simulation and optimize the control of the facade is developed in a generic programming language. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to design and demonstrate the effectiveness of a simulation-informed control strategy that can handle and optimise the behaviour of a complex facade by considering multiple performance objectives. The innovation of this approach lies in the MBC algorithm that selects the optimal facade state among over seventy possible states at each timestep, the practical demonstration of the feasibility in a BES tool, and the complexity of the controlled facade system. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed control approach, we compared the innovative MBC to more traditional control strategies, such as schedule and rule-based controls, revealing how it enabled the facade to achieve a better performance in all the analysed domains. By applying the MBC to three different year periods, we showed that the energy and environmental performance was within the selected comfort criteria for all the domains for>80% of the occupied hours, and an energy reduction of up to 70% was simultaneously obtained if compared to more traditional approaches. The control approach presented in this study and the simulation method employed can be used not only to improve the performance of advanced adaptive facades by providing an effective solution to the challenge of balancing multiple conflicting performance domains but also for more conventional building envelope systems that exhibit a certain degree of dynamic behaviour.",
          "Condition monitoring and timely repair of residential buildings is an important task when ensuring a comfortable life in cities. In the case of large metropolitan areas, it is a difficult task to perform continuous objective condition monitoring for tens of thousands of residential buildings by efforts of experts. However, residential infrastructure health can be predicted on the basis of indirect data. These can be objective building parameters or subjective data on citizens complaints about deterioration. In cities today, it is possible to collect such data in machine-readable form from various information systems. This article proposes a method to predict external deterioration of buildings on the basis of indirect data, using machine learning and SMILE Low-coding platform. Based on the results of method approbation, which used data of a metropolis, the significance of electronic participation data and objective parameters of objects for facade deterioration forecast was assessed. Options for further research are proposed to improve the quality of deterioration predicting by using data on citizens complaints about infrastructure damage.",
          "Adaptive architecture is expected to improve the performance of buildings and create more efficient building systems. One of the major research areas under this scope is the adaptive behavior of structural elements affected by load distribution. In order to achieve this, current studies develop structures that adapt by either following a database of precalculated equilibrium solutions or using self-learning algorithms to acquire active control systems to structures. This paper examined a case study element, which demonstrates an adaptive behavior in real time, based on self-learning abilities. The focus of this experiment was to gain control over a structural system as a whole (not only on a singular component) according to both objective and subjective parameters, that is, both load distribution parameters and spatial parameters, which are design related. The examined structural element was a canopy, situated in a dynamic environment that brought a change in the element's load distribution. The learning ability was given by applying a supervised learning algorithm-Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-on a physical prototype. The ANN was trained by an optimized database of finite solutions, which was created by a Genetic Algorithm. Through this method, complex calculations are conducted offline'', and the component operates in a decision-making'' mode in real time, adapting to a versatile environment while using minimal computational resources. Results show that the case study successfully exhibited self-learning and acquired the ability to adapt to unpredictable changing forces while keeping certain design requirements. This method can be applied over different structural elements (facade elements, canopies, structural components, etc.) to achieve adaptation to various parameters with an unpredictable pattern, such as human behavior or weather conditions.",
          "With the development of building design parameterization, more and more designers want to explore design options that optimize performance. However, the enormous time and costs that accompany optimization exploration are often beyond the reach of design practices. The application of machine learning in the construction field in recent years has offered potential solutions. Training predictive models through machine learning enables the rapid assessment of built environment performance and thus brings the optimization process closer to reality. In this paper, we mainly developed a process that integrates machine learning predictive model and multi-objective algorithms to achieve rapid evaluation and obtain optimal solutions. Using facade design as a case study, we demonstrate the design decision process with regard to the optimized solutions. The results showed that, through the proposed visual design decision process, designers can easily compare the performance and design appearance of different solutions and make informed decisions. In addition to saving 87% of time compared to the traditional simulation process, the integrated process also introduced the predictive model, which can achieve optimization exploration in one day. These results all demonstrate that the use of an integrated approach boasts considerable time advantages and potential feasibility in design practice.",
          "The accurate calculation of annual insolation for a large amount of building surfaces in urban environments is a key prerequisite for a targeted increase of the installed PV capacity. In this study, we build a digital city model upon publicly available geographic data. We use this model in combination with machine learning for performing PV potential analyses on large scales and at low computational costs. We train the machine learning algorithm using ground truth values for insolation, which we determine from forward ray tracing calculations for the city of Hanover, Germany. We find that our machine learning approach is able to predict the annual insolation for all types of building surfaces independent from their tilt and orientation. The RMSE relative to the mean ground truth value is 3.2% for rooftops and 8.8% for facades. The calculation time is reduced by a factor of 20 compared to the forward ray tracing approach.",
          "Digital design paradigms in architecture have been rooted in representational models which are geometry centered and therefore fail to capture building complexity holistically. Due to a lack of computational design methodologies, existing digital design workflows do little in predicting design performance in the early design stage and in most cases analysis and design optimization are done after a design is fixed. This work proposes a new computational design methodology, intended for use in the area of conceptual design of building design. The proposed methodology is implemented into a multi-agent system design toolkit which facilitates the generation of design alternatives using stochastic algorithms and their evaluation using multiple environmental performance metrics. The method allows the user to probabilistically explore the solution space by modeling the design parameters' architectural design components (i.e. facade panel) into modular programming blocks (agents) which interact in a bottom-up fashion. Different problem requirements (i.e. level of daylight inside a space, openings) described into agents' behavior allow for the coupling of data from different engineering fields (environmental design, structural design) into the a priori formation of architectural geometry. In the presented design experiment, a facade panel is modeled into an agent-based fashion and the multi-agent system toolkit is used to generate and evolve alternative facade panel configurations based on environmental parameters (daylight, energy consumption). The designer can develop the facade panel geometry, design behaviors, and performance criteria to evaluate the design alternatives. The toolkit relies on modular and functionally specific programming modules (agents), which provide a platform for facade design exploration by combining existing three-dimensional modeling and analysis software.",
          "This work analyzes data from an experimental study on facade sound insulation, consisting of independent repeated measurements executed by different laboratories on the same residential building. Mathematically, data can be seen as functions describing an acoustic parameter varying with frequency. The aim of this study is twofold. On one hand, considering the laboratory as the grouping variable, it is important to assess the within-group and between-group variability in the measurements. On the other hand, in building acoustics, it is known that sound insulation is more variable at low frequencies (from 50 to 100Hz), compared with higher frequencies (up to 5000Hz), and therefore, a multilevel functional model is employed to decompose the functional variance both at the measurement level and at the group level. This decomposition also allows for the ranking of the laboratories on the basis of measurement variability and performance at low frequencies (relative high variability) and over the whole spectrum. The former ranking is obtained via the principal component scores and the latter via an original Bayesian extension of the functional depth.",
          "Genetic algorithm (GA) are based on the continuation of fitter ones' lives considering the natural evolution. Data are coded as genes in the genetic algorithms. Optimal solutions can be achieved through the methods of crossing and mutation performed on these coded genes. Facade elements of the buildings with an architectural design in this study are independent of sustainability-related concerns, suggesting a great issue for the new buildings to be constructed in the traditional pattern. Accordingly, using the genetic algorithm method, proposals were presented for the new door and window typologies with genetic fitness for the architectural designing process of the buildings to be constructed in Surici Region, Diyarbakir, Turkey. Shape grammar, fractal and genetic algorithm, three generative designing systems, were used as the methods. Utilizing the genetic algorithm method, a field study was performed for the proposal of new door and window typologies with the fitness value. The field study was assessed through the plans and facade analyses regarding six Diyarbakir traditional houses with U plan type in Surici region of Diyarbakir. An identity card was created for the plan and facade data of the buildings and transferred to the table. Then, the door and window typologies of the exterior facade elements of each examined building were crossed within themselves with the GA method. As a result of the crossover, alternative joinery typologies with a total of 31 windows and 53 different door typologies with compatibility values were produced. Thus, the sustainability of the data of traditional joinery typologies for use in contemporary houses has been ensured. In conclusion, optimal alternative typologies were presented in regard to every chopping typology assessed with the genetic algorithm method. It is thought that this study should be a method that can be used in the production of exterior joinery typologies of contemporary houses to be built in many different cities of our country, especially in the historical texture. Thus, by using the GA method for the production of exterior joinery typologies of contemporary houses to be built in the region, different designers will be able to obtain various designs compatible with the traditional architectural texture while preserving their originality.",
          "In this study, comprehensive investigations were conducted on the structural behavior of masonry shear walls considering both aspect ratios and the axial forces. A reliable and simplified macro approach called Multi Pier (MP) method was employed to analyze single masonry piers with different aspect ratios (h/l). The shear and flexural strength along with the failure mechanism of each pier were obtained versus various levels of axial force during the sensitivity analysis. The results of the analysis were used as an input of a machine learning approach called Back Propagation Multi-Layer Perceptron (BPMLP) to generalize the data. The outcomes of machine learning was utilized to develop simple, but accurate equations as well as a user-friendly application to obtain the shear strength of a masonry pier according to the mechanical and geometrical properties. The BPMLP network is also able to produce and estimate all potential failure modes of a masonry wall. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed equations and developed application was evaluated using a novel macro-element approach. It is concluded that the proposed equations can be used in any macro-elements approach to enhancing efficiency and saving time. The proposed Equivalent Wall (EW) model was able to precisely estimate the response of full-scale facade masonry walls subjected to the in-plane loads. According to this model, each pier and spandrel was substituted by two elastic continuous (2D) macro-elements which connected via two bi-component discrete el-ements. A linear behavior based on masonry modulus of elasticity and bi-linear constitution according to the shear strength was assigned to the axial and shears components of the discrete links, respectively. The proposed EW model was verified using a five-story-seven-bay masonry wall. Satisfactory results were observed in terms of global load-deflection behavior comparing with popular approaches from the literature.",
          "The conception of a Generative Model (GM) is an important step when applying optimization methods in architectural design. The variant spectrum generable with a GM determines if an optimal solution for the different demands placed on a design can be found. Using the example of optimizing facades (more specifically window-layouts), it is shown that GM that exclusively vary either metric or topological properties of the geometry are not sufficient, because they only cover a highly restricted solution-space. To keep the solution space as large as possible, it is argued, that it is necessary to vary both topological and metric properties. The combination of both properties is called topo-metric properties. A GM for the generation of facade variants is presented, that is able to systematically vary these topo-metric properties. The effectiveness of the developed GM compared to conventional GMs is demonstrated using a simple test scenario.",
          "Robotic involvement in construction is still in its initial stages compared to other industries. Conventionally, the facade panel picking position is done manually by trial and error. The designer chooses a place to pick up a facade piece within reach of the robot arm, and then simulates the entire pick and place process in a digital model before applying to the assembly on the construction job site. After that the designer might detect errors, collisions, or singularities, which require the designer to modify the position of picking by changing the location or orientation of the module, thus repeating the simulation cycle until they reach a satisfactory result with no errors or collisions. This work is usually considered monotonous, inefficient, and time consuming. Therefore, this research proposes an optimization process implemented in design stage of construction project via static performance criteria in order to automatically search for the best picking location within the reach of the robot arm. The goal is to automate the process of robot location finding and solve the limitations of modular robot assembly simulation processes in order to allow for effective execution during the robotic construction implementation. The proposed approach, called iFobot, consists of three modules: Facade Generative Modeling (iFobot-D), Robot Position Optimization (iFobot-B), and Culminating Feedback to BIM (iFobot-L). Specifically, the scope of the paper is limited to the robot arm and facade picking and placing location finding processes. This research al lows initial assessment of the possible assembly process as regards the dimensions of modules and hence the overall dimensions of the system, which subsequently influences assembly implementation in the construction job site. A set of generative algorithms were developed using commercially developed visual programming language that automatically populate facade modules on the building envelope, find the robot and facade assembly locations with their quantity take-off, and integrate the module with the BIM environment. A case study has been developed to validate and test the proposed system. The results prove that the system generates optimized locations for the robot arm workstations with the lowest possible collision and reachability rate while addressing robot operation time reduction, thus reducing risks encountered during facade assembly and increasing productivity. Moreover, the iFobot is predicted to influence decision making during the facade assembly process on a physical construction job site.",
          "The factors affecting housing rent and take-up had been largely examined in a cluster. This leaves a dearth of knowledge on the influences of other disparate factors, such as the aesthetics of the building facade. This paper examines the effects of a deteriorated external wall paint on the tenants, rent and take-up of housing located in a high-end housing estate in Akure, Nigeria. The logic is to examine the place of aesthetics among the general factors affecting take-up and rental prices. Data were collected through census from 133 respondents residing in houses with deteriorated external wall paint. It applied both descriptive and multinomial logistic regression (MLR) to analyse the data. Findings Findings reveal that close to 60% of the respondents were psychologically affected by the visible deterioration of external wall paint. This translated to a significance reduction in rent compared with the rental prices of similar houses the appearance of which was not deteriorated. Generally, this study found that aesthetics paled into insignificance in the analysis of the general factors affecting housing take-up and rent. However, it ranked first when these were analysed on the structural characteristics of the house only. This is consistent with findings from the MLR parameter estimate, which shows that those who were psychologically affected are more likely to pay a 15% increase in their current rent to take up a similar house without paint deterioration. The findings of this study have implications on practice and theory. First, while the location mantra is a key determinant of rental prices in theory, in practice, rent on comparable houses could differ if the aesthetics of the external wall paint is compromised. This implies an avoidable loss of rent to the owner of a property who compromises the aesthetic quality of the external wall paint in a high-end location where affordability is arguably high. The implication on public authority is that a lower rent may have a negative implication on government revenue and specifically property tax which is normally based on market rent of a property. A novel quality of the study is that it separates the structural characteristics of a house from the general factors in order to examine the specific effect of deteriorated aesthetics of external wall paint on take-up and rent.",
          "Detailed parametric analysis and measurements are required to reduce building energy usage while maintaining acceptable thermal conditions. This research suggested a system that combines Building Information Modeling (BIM), machine learning, and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA II) to investigate the impact of building factors on energy usage and find the optimal design. A plugin is developed to receive sensor data and export all necessary information from BIM to MSSQL and Excel. The BIM model was imported to IDA Indoor Climate and Energy (IDA ICE) to execute an energy con-sumption simulation and then a pairwise test to produce the sample data set. To study the data set and develop a prediction model between building factors and energy usage, 11 machine learning algorithms are used. The best algorithm was Group Least Square Support Vector Machine (GLSSVM), later employed in NSGA II as the building energy consumption fitness function using Dynamo software. An NSGA II multi-objective optimization model is designed to reduce building energy consumption and optimize interior thermal comfort (measured by the predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD)). The Pareto front is calculated, and the optimum point approach is used to find the best combination of building envelope characteristics, HVAC setpoints, shading parameters, lighting, and air infiltration. The feasibility and effectiveness of the developed framework are demonstrated using a case study of an upper secondary school building in Norway; the results show that: (1) The GLSSVM has a unique capacity to forecast build-ing energy use with high accuracy: R2 of 0.99, an RMSE of 1.2, MSE of 1.44, and MAE of 0.89; (2) Building energy consumption and thermal comfort may be successfully improved by the GLSSVM-NSGA II hybrid technique, which reduces energy consumption by 37.5% and increases thermal comfort by 33.5%, respectively.",
          "As improved building energy efficiency becomes mandatory, dynamic shading systems are ex-pected to reduce building energy demand because their control mechanisms are increasingly self-adaptable to changes in the environment. Various shading control strategies had been proposed and compared in existing literature, but their energy performance can be further improved with a more comprehensive consideration of environmental changes and indoor demand. This study develops and validates an adaptive predictive control (APC) model for roller shades that combines simulation-based optimization of shading control with machine learning. The model predicts the appropriate position of roller shades based on multiple environmental parameters, minimizing the building energy demand. EnergyPlus and Python provide continuous energy simulation and data processing. Using pre-simulated datasets, machine learning algorithms develop APC models. The study scenario is a typical office space in Guangzhou, China. Quantitative analysis of the simulation results elucidates the effectiveness of the method. The performance of the model was evaluated using historical meteorological data from 2020. The proposed control model was able to achieve nearly optimal energy efficiency, reducing energy demand by 38.3% while reaching annual Useful Daylight Illuminances of 72.9%.",
          "Operation of environmentally responsive building components requires rapid prediction of the optimal adaptation of geometric shapes and positions, and such responsive configuration needs to be identified during the design process as early as possible. However, building simulation practices to characterize optimized shapes of various geometric design candidates are limited by complex simulation procedures, slow optimization, and lack of site information. This study suggests a practical approach to the design of responsive building facades by integrating on-site sensors, building performance simulation (BPS), machine-learning, and 3D geometry modeling on a unified design interface. To this end, a novel and efficient hybrid optimization algorithm, tabu-based adaptive pattern search simulated annealing (T-APSSA), was developed and integrated with wireless sensor data communication (using nRF24L01 and ESP8266 WiFi modules) on a parametric visual programming language (VPL) interface Rhino Grasshopper (0.9.0076, McNeel, Seattle, USA). The effectiveness of T-APSSA for early-stage BPS and optimal design is compared with other metaheuristic algorithms, and the proposed framework is validated by experimental optimal envelope (window shading) designs for single (daylight) and multiple (daylight and energy) objectives. Test results demonstrate the improved efficiency of T-APSSA in calculations (two to four times faster than other algorithms). This T-APSSA-integrated sensor-enabled design optimization practice supports rapid BPS and digital prototyping of responsive building facade design.",
          "This study aims to produce generative curtain wall geometries based on predetermined parameters such as storey information, shadow zones, preliminary building unit cost, frequency, etc. in a BIM platform for the preliminary design of a future project in Basmane and understand its novel outcomes and implications. The methodology is construed over four successive phases, namely: the built environment modeling, analyses for a solid understanding of the study area, determination of the generative design criteria, and finally design solutions. In the initial phase, the case-study building in Basmane with the surrounding environment was digitally modeled for the following analyses. Several programs apart from BIM have been utilized for the daylight zones and wind simulations. The daylight areas affecting the surface of the studied building were marked schematically per the simulation data. Subsequently, the area of the curtain wall, material type, preliminary building unit cost (assembly/labor and material cost), the height of storey, the density of elements, and fixed shading devices parameters were tested via optimization thru generative design methodology and provide potential design solutions by utilization of BIM tools. The findings of this study could be boiled down to a single comprehensive objective of generating outputs of assorted design solutions thru a generative design approach. When the output data set is visualized via parallel coordinate graphs, it could be well articulated that the classification of rule-based relationships and the criteria interrelations were based on the designer's decisions. Research Limitations/Implications This study was examined on a case basis by an experimental approach. It shall be considered that the curtain wall construction encompasses diverse materials, connection details, and construction techniques that affect the final cost thus this research was conducted at the preliminary design stage and might not reflect actual costs. Social/Practical Implications Albeit the technical aspect of the curtain walls is not included in this case study, it helps generative design culture by demonstrating the extent of the opportunities it offers to designers in the preliminary design stage. This study is a show-case of a preliminary design for an actual building stock in the vicinity of Basmane focusing on the building envelope design process with multiple parameters and should be regarded as an opportunity to understand how innovative solutions alike are put forward for the use of designers.",
          "Solar power forecasting is of high interest in managing any power system based on solar energy. In the case of photovoltaic (PV) systems, and building integrated PV (BIPV) in particular, it may help to better operate the power grid and to manage the power load and storage. Power forecasting directly based on PV time series has some advantages over solar irradiance forecasting first and PV power modeling afterwards. In this paper, the power forecasting for BIPV systems in a vertical facade is studied using machine learning algorithms based on decision trees. The forecasting scheme employs the skforecast library from the Python environment, which facilitates the implementation of different schemes for both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting applications. Firstly, deterministic forecasting of hourly BIPV power was performed with XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms for different cases, showing an improvement in forecasting accuracy when some exogenous variables were used. Secondly, probabilistic forecasting was performed with XGBoost combined with the Bootstrap method. The results of this paper show the capabilities of Random Forest and gradient boosting algorithms, such as XGBoost, to work as regressors in time series forecasting of BIPV power. Mean absolute error in the deterministic forecast, using the most influencing exogenous variables, were around 40% and close below 30% for the south and east array, respectively.",
          "Environmental factors directly affect a building's performance and durability. They are particularly detrimental in the case of building envelope materials and systems because these tend to exhibit a large exposed area and relatively narrow thickness. Therefore, tools are needed to model degradation and provide an insight into its occurrence and its relationship with the environmental factors that have the worst effect. In this paper, the degradation of stone wall cladding directly adhered to the substrate is estimated based on the evaluation of the characteristics of 140 wall cladding systems inspected in Lisbon, Portugal. Because it is a complex phenomenon, a probabilistic analysis is developed using multinomial logistic regression. The analysis focuses on the environmental factors that most influence the overall degradation of the facades (condition level). Probabilistic patterns are thus obtained for the evolution over time of each condition level according to their exposure level to outdoor environmental conditions.",
          "The housing sector consumes a significant amount of energy worldwide, which is mainly attributed to operating energy systems for the provision of thermally comfortable indoor environments. Although the literature in this field has focused on investigating critical factors in energy consumption, only a few studies have conducted a quantitative sensitivity analysis for thermal occupant factors (TOF) (i.e., metabolic rate and clothing level). Therefore, this paper introduces a framework for testing the criticality of TOF with a cross-comparison against building-related factors, considering the constraint of occupant thermal comfort. Using a building energy simulation model, the energy consumption of a case study is simulated, and building energy model alternatives are generated. The scope includes TOF and building envelope factors, with an established orthogonal experimental design. A popular branch of machine learning (ML) called linear genetic programming (LGP) is used to analyse the generated data from the experiment. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted using the developed LGP model to determine and rank the criticality of the considered factors. The findings reveal that occupants' metabolic rate and clothing level have relevancy factors of -0.48 and -0.38 respectively, which ranked them 2nd and 3rd against building envelope factors for achieving energy-efficient comfortable houses. This research contributes to the literature by introducing a framework that couples orthogonal experiment design with ML techniques to quantify the criticality of TOF and rank them against building-envelope factors.",
          "In recent years, especially in a building envelope, parametric design provides a method of continuous deformation of facade patterns until the architect finds interesting patterns or shapes that satisfy the desired aesthetics. However, these new design methods pose a question regarding the reasoning behind them, and sometimes the aesthetic interest dominates the true function of the envelope system and contrasts it. In opposite, too much engineering in the envelope system creates a problem with the identity of the facade. The purpose of this paper is to propose a method to integrate two different performances, quality and quantity, into one measurable goal. Using an existing building's facade as a case study, the building's facade was analyzed to understand the architect's logic behind its design. Then the found logic was programmed into the tool that allowed for the morphing of the facade into a different configuration, which can be evaluated by both quality and quantity performance to find the better solution to satisfy both goals. For the purpose of this paper, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms were considered to find solutions. For a quantitative objective, the indoor daylight availability was used as a measurement to allow for the best daylighting performance envelope system. For a qualitative objective, a matrix was developed to find the user's design preference and used it to evaluate and find a quantitative performance goal. The proposed method provides building facades that satisfy daylighting performance, and most importantly, it allows users to match their aesthetic sensibilities with the design preference.",
          "This paper describes the multi-objective optimized design of fenestration that is based on the facade of the building being divided into a number of small regularly spaced cells. The minimization of energy use and capital cost by a multi-objective genetic algorithm was investigated for: two alternative problem encodings (bit-string and integer); the application of constraint functions to control the aspect ratio of the windows; and the seeding of the search with feasible design solutions. It is concluded that the optimization approach is able to find near locally Pareto optimal solutions that have innovative architectural forms. Confidence in the optimality of the solutions was gained through repeated trail optimizations and a local search and sensitivity analysis. It was also concluded that seeding the optimization with feasible solutions was important in obtaining the optimum solutions when the window aspect ratio was constrained.",
          "Green building information modeling (Green BIM) is focused on a project using BIM as a basic tool from the beginning of the design stage and employs building performance analysis (BPA) in the design-analysis decision-making cycle to obtain an optimized design proposal. However, there are inevitable discrepancies between the simulated performance data and the data obtained from the actual environment. Neural network learning can be used in conjunction with training to obtain a predictive ability, and the resulting predictive values are more representative of actual performance than simulation values. In this study, it is proposed that a predictive value be used instead of a simulation value in judging whether design goals have been met. To construct an adaptive building envelope based on daylight simulation, this project plans to carry out the following six steps in a two-stage process: Stage 1: Data collection and learning: (1) BIM modeling, (2) BPA performance simulation, (3) production of an actual structure and illuminance measurement, and (4) collection of sample data to perform training in supervised neural network learning. Stage 2: After obtaining a predictive ability: (5) setting targets to find an optimized adaptation plan and (6) implementation of script-oriented automatic control.",
          "A genetic algorithm and an artificial neural network are deployed for the design of a dynamic multi-layered facade system that adapts in real-time to different weather and occupants' needs scenarios. The outputs are a set of different performances of the facade insulation cushions, optimized by the previous run of the genetic algorithm. A facade system of ETFE cushions is considered for them to learn from environmental data models. Each facade cushion is set up as an artificial neuron that is linked to the behavior and temperature of the others. The proposed outputs are a set of different performances of the facade system that are optimized through running the genetic algorithm. Facade neurons are configured as genes of the system that is abstractly represented on a digital model. The computational model manages cushion patterns' performances through several phenotypical adaptations, suggesting that the proposed facade system maximizes its thermal efficiency in different scenarios.",
          "The conventional control paradigm for a heat pump with a less efficient auxiliary heating element is to keep its temperature set point constant during the day. This constant temperature set point ensures that the heat pump operates in its more efficient heat-pump mode and minimizes the risk of activating the less efficient auxiliary heating element. As an alternative to a constant set-point strategy, this paper proposes a learning agent for a thermostat with a set-back strategy. This set-back strategy relaxes the set-point temperature during convenient moments, e.g., when the occupants are not at home. Finding an optimal set-back strategy requires solving a sequential decision-making process under uncertainty, which presents two challenges. The first challenge is that for most residential buildings, a description of the thermal characteristics of the building is unavailable and challenging to obtain. The second challenge is that the relevant information on the state, i.e., the building envelope, cannot be measured by the learning agent. In order to overcome these two challenges, our paper proposes an auto-encoder coupled with a batch reinforcement learning technique. The proposed approach is validated for two building types with different thermal characteristics for heating in the winter and cooling in the summer. The simulation results indicate that the proposed learning agent can reduce the energy consumption by 4%-9% during 100 winter days and by 9%-11% during 80 summer days compared to the conventional constant set-point strategy.",
          "This study assessed associations between house characteristics and mold and musty odor, using data from three consecutive (2005, 2010, and 2015) New Zealand House Condition Surveys, involving a total of 1616 timber-framed houses. Mold, musty odor, and house characteristics were assessed by independent building inspectors. We used multivariate logistic regression analyses mutually adjusted for other house characteristics for each survey separately. Positive and independent associations were found with tenure, ventilation, insulation, and envelope condition for both mold in living and bedrooms and musty odor. In particular, we found significant dose-response associations with envelope condition, ventilation, and insulation. Odds of mold increased 2.4-15.9 times (across surveys) in houses with the worst building envelope condition (BEC; p < 0.05-0.001 for trend); optimal ventilation reduced the risk of mold by 60% and the risk of musty odor by 70%-90% (p < 0.01 for trend). Other factors associated with mold and musty odor included: tenure, with an approximate doubling of odds of mold across surveys; and insulation with consistent dose-response patterns in all outcomes and surveys tested (p < 0.05 for trend in two surveys with mold and one survey for odor). In conclusion, this study showed the importance of BEC, ventilation, and insulation to avoiding harmful damp-related exposures.",
          "In this paper, we propose a method to quantify the likelihood that perforated exterior facade panels will produce wind-induced noise. This noise is generated by pressure fluctuations when vortices shed off the panels. The frequency and audibility are influenced by panel geometry, wind velocity, turbulence, and wind angle of incidence. We performed parametric computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analyses of perforated panels to calculate sound pressure levels and trained a machine learning algorithm on that data. We applied the learned relationship to a building scale CFD analysis accounting for annual variation of wind direction and strength to predict the likelihood of noise at any location on the building for a typical weather year.",
          "Building performance design plays a key role in reducing the energy consumption of buildings. However, the widely used simulation-based design is facing several challenges, such as the labor-intensive modeling process and the performance gaps between design stage estimations and operational energy use. For these reasons, artificial intelligent methods are expected by designers to improve the efficiency and reliability of building energy-efficient design. To date, there has not been a practical data-driven design method of envelopes. This study aimed at exploring data-driven building energy-efficient design of envelopes based on their quantified impacts. A feature selection method and a game-theoretic method were applied to quantify the impacts of envelopes on space heating and cooling energy, which were performed on two building datasets, one of which is from the U.S. and the other from China. Random forest classifiers were developed to conduct the study. Based on discovered energy patterns and quantified impacts of envelopes on energy consumption, a rectified linear design method of envelopes was proposed with the idea of improving the performance of high-impact envelopes. Besides, a validation study was conducted on two office buildings in the hot-summer cold-winter region. To design the envelopes of a building, the data-driven analysis was driven by its similar buildings other than the whole dataset. Moreover, a detailed energy simulation was conducted to evaluate the energy performance of different design solutions. The results showed that compared with baseline design solutions, new strategies could save 1.05%-21.2% energy for space heating and cooling for these two case buildings. The proposed method is a general building envelope design approach and allows designers to easily find an energy-efficient configuration of envelopes. This study demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the data-driven energy-efficient design of building envelopes.",
          "Artificial intelligence techniques have been successfully applied to control dynamic systems looking for an optimal control. Among those techniques, reinforcement learning has been shown as particularly effective at reducing the dimensionality of some real problems and solving control problems by learning from experience. The use of thermal energy storage active systems in the building sector is identified as suitable option to reduce their energy demand for heating and cooling. However, these systems might be expensive and require appropriate control strategies in order to improve the performance of the building. In this paper a ventilated facade with PCM is controlled using a reinforcement learning algorithm. The ventilated facade uses mechanical ventilation during nighttime to solidify the PCM and releases this cold stored to the inner environment during the peak demand period. It is crucial to decide correctly the schedule of charge and discharge process of the PCM according to the weather and indoor conditions. An experimentally validated numerical model is used to test the performance of the control algorithm under different weather conditions. Important improvements on the energy savings due to the use of control strategies were found and supported by the data under the different tested climatic conditions.",
          "Building thermal models, which characterize the properties of a building's envelope and thermal mass, are essential for accurate indoor temperature and cooling/heating demand prediction. Because of their flexibility and ease of use, data-driven models are increasingly used. This study compared and analyzed the performance of gray-box (resistance-capacitance) and black-box (recurrent neural network) models for predicting indoor air temperature in a real multi-zone commercial building. The developed resistance-capacitance model served as a benchmark model for which full sets of temporal data and building information were used as inputs. The recurrent neural network models were trained and tested assuming various available types and amounts of temporal data and known building physical information to investigate the effects of data and information availability. Feature importance analysis was conducted to select the key variables for different prediction targets under different scenarios. This research provides guidance in selecting an appropriate building thermal response modeling method based on the measured data availability, building physical information, and application.",
          "The application of energy-efficient strategies in buildings, such as the Green Building Concept, can significantly impact human comfort and resource consumption. However, due to the complexity of decision-making factors and the variety of available materials, computational models are necessary to identify the most effective solutions and optimise building energy performance. This study presents an integrated framework that uses machine learning algorithms and a Petri Net control system to optimise the thermal, comfort, and energy efficiency of both vertical and horizontal building envelopes in semi-arid climate zones. The framework incorporates several passive techniques for building energy parameters, including material thickness and melting point, window types, wall insulation thickness and thermal emissivity, wall solar absorbance, window wall ratio, fenestration position, air tightness, roof solar reflectance, roof insulation thickness and conductivity (W/(m.degrees C)), and floor insulation thickness. An experiment design was developed using Box-Behnken Design-Response Surface Methodology (BBD-RSM) for statistical optimisation, which was coupled with Design Builder simulation model. The methodology was demonstrated by applying it to a residential building in Mexico. Meta Additive Regression was used to analyse the output factors, which showed higher confidence compared to REP Tree and M5P Tree algorithms in green buildings. The results demonstrate that an annual energy reduction of 50 kW/m(2) per household can be achieved by using an optimised building envelope.",
          "Photovoltaic shading devices (PVSDs) not only generate electricity, but also control the solar radiation that passes through, thus enhancing the energy performance of the building. Geometry optimization and adjustable devices are considered as effective ways to improve the energy performance of PVSDs. Previously proposed methods fail to evaluate the importance of the geometric parameters of PVSDs comprehensively, and the proposed dynamic control strategy for adjustable PVSDs cannot respond to real-time weather changes. Therefore, this paper proposes an optimal design method for PVSDs to maximize energy performance by an optimized geometry and the proposed adaptive control model (ACM). Compared with previous studies, the proposed method integrates the influence of geometric parameters on energy performance, and the ACM proposed is able to adjust the tilt angle of PVSDs instantaneously based on real-time weather data. Subsequently, an office in Guangzhou was used as a case study for the evaluation to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that by using the optimized PVSDs, the cooling and lighting demand of the office is reduced by up to 48.7%. They are completely covered by the generated power, along with an energy surplus of 1034.4 kWh per year. In addition, daylighting in the office was enhanced, with a maximum UDI improvement of 71.6%.",
          "A high-efficiency perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell has been a promising candidate for building -integrated photovoltaics. This work presents a deep learning approach to predicting the annual output energy harvested by the 2-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, thereby optimizing the tandem structure design. The data set for training and validating an artificial neural network (ANN) is the Atlas-simulated results of the tandem cell with the various perovskite layer's bandgap and thickness under the real-world conditions composed of the solar spectrum, incident spectral angle, and solar module temperature in a particular month of a year for a specific direction. Consequently, we reveal the significant influence of solar spectral shape on the ANN performance. The proposed ANN model has a mean square error of 1.26 and a correlation coefficient of 0.99979. Based on the spectral and environmental database in Gifu (Japan) in 2015, we predict that the optimal perovskite layer's bandgap and thickness are 1.72 eV and 680 nm for the east, south, and west facades, 1.73 eV and 700 nm for the rooftop, respectively. Consequently, the highest annual output energy obtained is 282.54, 105.07, 174.71, and 90.79 kWh/m2 for the rooftop, the east, south, and west facades, respectively.",
          "Building envelopes invariably tend to be static systems that encounter various performance limitations such as inefficient illuminance admittance, and heat and moisture transmission owing to their non-responsiveness towards environmental fluctuations. In contrast to such facade solutions, responsive facade systems with embedded sensing, actuation, and control systems have been proven to perform with up to 65% higher efficiency by being able to adapt their physical characters, such as orientation, and material property in real-time as a response to fluctuating environmental conditions (visual and thermal) and user preferences. Advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning processes further aid such responsive facade systems to optimize multiple parameters such as illuminance level and the associated lighting energy, visual discomfort caused by solar glare, solar heat gain, thermal resistance (heating energy and comfort level), and natural ventilation simultaneously. This research investigates the case of a real-time adaptive Building Integrated Photo Voltaic (BIPV) shading system and its ability (in comparison with traditional static building integrated photo voltaic facade systems) to perform as regards visual comfort and energy generation potential simultaneously within the humid subtropical climate of Sydney, Australia. A simulated case scenario wherein a real-time adaptive building integrated photo voltaic shading systems is deployed on a typical multistorey building facade in Sydney, Australia is accordingly presented. The conducted simulation considers the responsive building integrated photo voltaic system as a double-skin facade system and uses multi-objective evolutionary computing principles to decipher its integrability potential. A comparative analysis between traditional static mounted Photo Voltaic (PV) systems as opposed to multi-objective optimization driven real-time adaptive building integrated photo voltaic shading configurations is subsequently presented. The ability to maximize generated energy, while simultaneously maintaining visual comfort is thus a unique proposition of this research.",
          "Covering buildings with vegetation systems has been a significant feature of architectural design towards sustainability in recent years. This study reports an investigation on the green wall thermal performance compared to the bare wall on the northern facade of a 2-story residential building in the humid climate of Rasht during summertime. For experimental measurements, temperature and humidity data loggers were used for real-time data collection. Thereafter, an existing building was modeled in EnergyPlus for validation purposes. According to the results, a decrease in temperature and relative humidity was seen in the case of the building with a green wall. It was found that the green wall could drop the indoor temperature by 9% and also decrease the relative humidity level by 32%. Besides, in order to predict the green wall performance in a short time interval, a deep artificial neural network was trained from the experimental data and a 15-day weather dataset was collected and fed into the deep learning model. Moreover, the ENVI-met software is utilized to evaluate the effect of the green wall on the surrounding air. Findings indicated that the temperature in front of the green wall is slightly lower than the part of the wall without the plant. The highest temperate reduction was 0.36 degrees C at 12 p. m., which is insignificant.",
          "The performance of the building envelope of a large-scale public building significantly influences the energy consumption of such a building. This study aims to determine the best strategy for the envelope by examining the engineering design of the building in Nanchang University. The building shape coefficient, sun-shading strategies, window wall ratio, roof, and walls were studied through a method involving multilayer feed-forward neural network model simulations. Results show that the optimum shape coefficient value is 0.32. The combination of interior and exterior blinds and electrochromic glass is the ideal option to reduce the increase in the energy consumption of the architecture caused by solar radiation. Maintaining the window wall ratio at 0.4 is ideal. A green roof exerts a minimal effect on building energy consumption decrease (only 0.4%). Applying the strategy of vertical greening to the external wall can reduce cooling energy consumption by as much as 5.4%. Adopting the best envelope strategy combination can further decrease energy consumption by 20.8%. This strategy is also applicable to the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River in China, which flow through Nanchang and have a climate similar to that of the said area. Future research should be directed toward applying artificial neural networks to quantitatively evaluate the effects of a design strategy and produce the best design strategy combination.",
          "Unlike many previous studies that often focus on optimizing energy efficiency for buildings when detailed design drawings are available, this paper introduces a newly integrated model for energy-efficient building envelope design in the early stages (when detailed design drawings are not yet available). The newly developed model includes three main components: a simulation model, a predictive model, and an optimization model. The simulation model simulates the building's energy performance, considering different values for various envelope parameters. The predictive model employs machine learning algorithms, including RF, ANN, DNN, SVM, GENLIN, and GB (in which GB has been identified as the most suitable algorithm), boasting a very high R2(0.994) to assess energy consumption. The optimization model which uses AI optimization algorithms (such as NSGA II, DSE, and MOPSO) integrates the machine learning predictive model into the evaluation function during the evolutionary process, efficiently searching for Pareto-optimal building envelope solutions. Results show simultaneous savings in cost and energy, with savings of 7.52 % in cost and 8.48 % in energy, or 21.17 % in cost and 0.4 % in energy, for a case study in Vietnam. This model establishes a foundation by providing design solutions for stakeholders to assess, and can incorporate additional objectives at later stages.",
          "Consolidated urban areas usually present a challenge for the sustainable design decisions for the architect. The site, orientation and surrounding built environment compromise both passive and active systems, shortening the possible optimization measures available, leaving the designer with doubts as far as efficiency is concerned.BIM methodologies and visual programming languages have opened up a very wide range of design and analysis tools allowing the architect to make informed decisions based on data extracted from the models. Nonetheless it's optimization is through a slow process of trial and error, creating a significant limitation. This paper discusses the potentialities of the use of evolutionary algorithms to generate optimized solutions for facade solar orientation. A comparison between three different evolutionary algorithms aiming for solar radiation, inside average temperature allows to conclude the best result versus time consumed. Although under similar results the multi-objective EA represents the best compromise between time and final objective on the case study chosen for the paper. The interconnectivity in real time of BIM and algorithmic modeling softwares represents an advantage for time saving sustainable design decisions.",
          "The shift from conventional buildings to the so-called Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs) is becoming one of the major contemporary challenges in the world. In this work, a multi-objective optimization approach, based on a smart surrogate model, has been developed to minimize the energy consumption, improve the thermal comfort of the occupants and increase the energy self-sufficiency of residential buildings. For this purpose, two main phases have been considered: the first one is related to the development of the surrogate model, based on machine learning utilities, in particular Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and the second is related to the optimization process, performed by means of the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (MOPSO). This approach has been applied to a typical Moroccan building, Ground Floor thorn First Floor (GFFF), in different regulatory climate zones. The results show that the approach was successfully implemented using TRNSYS, Matlab and other numerical simulation tools, leading to different solutions in terms of building envelope design. The best-fit solution achieved a huge improvement potential in most climate zones, averaging about 75%, 50% and 85% respectively for energy consumption, thermal comfort and energy self-sufficiency of the studied building. Finally, we strongly recommend this approach to the various stakeholders in this field, including de-signers, engineers, architects, consulting firms, etc., since the results have proven its effectiveness as a very promising step towards designing Comfortable and Nearly Zero Energy Buildings. Future work will focus on the implementation of a hardware device that is able to perform all the steps of the proposed framework for possible pre-project optimizations.",
          "The Army Research Laboratory's Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance (RCTA) is a program intended to change robots from tools that soldiers use into teammates with which soldiers can work. This requires the integration of fundamental and applied research in perception, artificial intelligence, and human-robot interaction. In October of 2014, the RCTA assessed progress towards integrating this research. This assessment was designed to evaluate the robot's performance when it used new capabilities to perform selected aspects of a mission. The assessed capabilities included the ability of the robot to: navigate semantically outdoors with respect to structures and landmarks, identify doors in the facades of buildings, and identify and track persons emerging from those doors. We present details of the mission-based vignettes that constituted the assessment, and evaluations of the robot's performance in these vignettes.",
          "Reliable data-driven models that estimate building envelope properties are indispensable for achieving emissions reduction targets. An extensive body of existing research investigates such methods, but benchmarking is limited and it is often unclear whether the approaches are scalable and robust to diverse building properties. Machine learning approaches, which natively handle complex, multivariate datasets, are rarely applied in this domain. This paper benchmarks seven different methods for characterization of the whole-building heat loss coefficient, including traditional gray box and novel black box approaches. To do so, a dataset of 16,000 simulated buildings is created. The models are benchmarked against ground truth, including an assessment of robustness to climate, construction materials, air-infiltration rate and occupant behaviour. We show the deep learning methods outperform other approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness, but that all of the approaches have limitations that restrain their practical usage. Based on this result, we suggest that further research is required to develop reliable and scalable approaches for the characteri-zation of quantitative envelope properties from sensor data. The model code, data creation pipeline and final dataset used for this work are open-sourced so that future work can expand on this study. We encourage the use of our framework to support innovation in this domain.",
          "Physical models and probabilistic applications often guide the study and characterization of natural phenomena in engineering. Such is the case of the study of air change rates (ACHs) in buildings for their complex mechanisms and high variability. It is not uncommon for the referred applications to be costly and impractical in both time and computation, resulting in the use of simplified methodologies and setups. The incorporation of airtightness limits to quantify adequate ACHs in national transpositions of the Energy Performance Building Directive (EPBD) exemplifies the issue. This research presents a roadmap for developing an alternative instrument, a compliance tool built with a Machine Learning (ML) framework, that overcomes some simplification issues regarding policy implementation while fulfilling practitioners' needs and general societal use. It relies on dwellings' terrain, geometric and airtightness characteristics, and meteorological data. Results from previous work on a region with a mild heating season in southern Europe apply in training and testing the proposed tool. The tool outputs numerical information on the air change rates performance of the building envelope, and a label, accordingly. On the test set, the best regressor showed mean absolute errors (MAE) below 1.02% for all the response variables, while the best classifier presented an average accuracy of 97.32%. These results are promising for the generalization of this methodology, with potential for application at regional, national, and European Union levels. The developed tool could be a complementary asset to energy certification programmes of either public or private initiatives.",
          "Unfinished buildings are a constant throughout the history of architecture and have given rise to intense debates on the opportuneness of their completion, in addition to offering alibis for theorizing about the compositional possibilities in coherence with the finished parts. The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) opens new avenues for the proposal of possibilities for the completion of unfinished architectures. Specifically, with the recent appearance of tools such as DALL-E, capable of completing images guided by a textual description, it is possible to count on the help of AI for architectural design tasks. In this article we explore the use of these new AI tools for the completion of unfinished facades of historical temples and analyse the still germinal stadium in the field of architectural graphic composition.",
          "Evaluating the blast loads that structures can be subjected to mainly relies on traditional design manuals that are mostly restricted to free-field explosions or to confined settings of simple geometry. However, the blast loads that apply to structures located in denser environments are significantly affected by the complex interactions of the blast wave with the urban topography. Many existing works address the effects resulting from such interactions; however, their scopes are mostly limited to considering a few buildings or streets, while the influence of building porosity on the shielding effect has received limited attention. This work utilizes validated high-fidelity numerical simulations to carry out a detailed investigation of the influence of a building's porosity (categorized as zero, low, mediumand high) on its capacity to shield virtual facades located at several distances behind the shielding structure. The results show that the shielding effect is mainly bounded below by that behind the high-porosity building and above by that behind the zero or low-porosity building, depending on the standoff distance to the charge. Finally, suitable scaling and modeling approaches including regression and machine learning techniques are applied to devise simplified, yet more general data -driven surrogate tools for computationally inexpensive predictions. These can contribute in helping design engineers evaluate blast loads behind porous structures following explosions in cityscapes.",
          "The envelope openings of houses have a strong implication in the indoor environmental quality and energy consumption. Nevertheless, there are no precise regulations for its design in equatorial tropics. Normally these designs are based in the previous experiences and common sense of the architect. Determining the correct configuration of a design problem with the desired performance is now possible with the introduction of Parametric Design and Genetic Algorithms; through these it's possible to obtain the best alternatives in the initial phase of design. The main focus of this investigation is to design windows that proportion adequate conditions of thermal and visual comfort, for a warm and humid tropical climate. The use of generative tools allows the evaluation of results in the initial stages of the project, giving the designer the possibility of choosing among diverse results with a high grade of efficiency and sustainability.",
          "We present our work on the training of robotised architectural components of intelligent buildings, focusing on main architectural components and features such as facades, roofs and partitions. The parameters governing such components may be either quantitative (such as temperature, humidity, configuration of the elements) or qualitative (such as ergonomics and aesthetics), which cannot easily be described by mathematical parameters. Due to their complexity,it is often impossible -or at least impractical, to hardcode suitable controllers for such robotised structures. Thus, we propose the use of Artificial Intelligence learning techniques, concretely Evolutionary Algorithms, so that the user can teach the robotised components how to behave in response to changing environmental conditions or user preferences. This idea is tested on an intelligent rooftop with variable geometry, that learns optimal configurations with respect to ambient light during training sessions.",
          "Different standard methods for the assessment of the thermal performance of the building envelope are used: analogy with coeval building, theoretical method, heat flow meter measurement, simple hot box, infrared thermography, and thermometric method. Review papers on these methods, applied in situ and in laboratory, have been published, focusing on theory, equipment, metrological performance, test conditions and data acquisition, data analysis, benefits, and limitations. However, steps forward have been done and not been deepened in previous works: in fact, the representative points method and the weighted area method have been proposed, too, whilst artificial intelligence and data-driven methods have begun to prove the reliability also in the U-value prevision using available datasets. Considering this context, this work aims at updating the literature background considering exclusively in situ methods. The work starts from bibliometric and scientometric analysis not previously conducted: this helped to group the methods and to sketch the innovations and the future perspectives. Indeed, from the bibliometric and scientometric literature analysis what emerged was (i) the richness of the background on this topic, especially in the recent years, (ii) two macro-groups (methods with and without measurements), and (iii) the importance of paper keywords (otherwise, interesting papers are eluded by the output of simple database queries). The method study that followed aims at providing (i) a broader view of the thermal transmittance (U-value) assessment procedures, including the utmost recent applications, proposal, and outlooks in this field, (ii) the understanding on the fundamental theories of the techniques, (iii) practical advice for building-envelope assessment, focusing on the advantages and limitations useful for professionals and researchers involved in the energy audit, conservation, or refurbishment of building stock, (iv) the identification of the interconnection between the techniques that often rely on one another, and (v) final remarks and future perspective of the procedures, which embrace the use of artificial intelligence (AI). From the topic analysis, as a result, it emerged that this is an open field for future research, especially with the implementation of AI, which requires good datasets and trials on the models' architectures, in terms of input layer, number of hidden layer and neurons, and percentage of data to be employed for model training and testing."

          "'Big data' and the use of 'Artificial Intelligence' (AI) is currently advancing due to the increasing and even cheaper data collection and processing capabilities. Social and economical change is predicted by numerous company leaders, politicians and researchers. Machine and Deep Learning (ML/DL) are sub-types of AI, which are gaining high interest within the community of data scientists and engineers worldwide. Obviously, this global trend does not stop at structural glass engineering, so that, the first part of the present paper is concerned with introducing the basic theoretical frame of AI and its sub-classes of ML and DL while the specific needs and requirements for the application in a structural engineering context are highlighted. Then this paper explores potential applications of AI for different subjects within the design, verification and monitoring of facades and glass structures. Finally, the current status of research as well as successfully conducted industry projects by the authors are presented. The discussion of specific problems ranges from supervised ML in case of the material parameter identification of polymeric interlayers used in laminated glass or the prediction of cut-edge strength based on the process parameters of a glass cutting machine and prediction of fracture patterns of tempered glass to the application of computer vision DL methods to image classification of the Pummel test and the use of semantic segmentation for the detection of cracks at the cut edge of glass. In the summary and conclusion section, the main findings for the applicability and impact of AI for the presented structural glass research and industry problems are compiled. It can be seen that in many cases AI, data, software and computing resources are already available today to successfully implement AI projects in the glass industry, which is demonstrated by the many current examples mentioned. Future research directories however will need to concentrate on how to introduce further glass-specific theoretical and human expert knowledge in the AI training process on the one hand and on the other hand more pronunciation has to be laid on the thorough digitization of workflows associated with the structural glass problem at hand in order to foster the further use of AI within this domain in both research and industry.",
          "Building energy retrofit has a significant role in achieving clean energy goals in the United States, creating a vast construction market. The initial step to improving energy efficiency is a detailed building inspection. However, building inspections are often time-consuming and not scalable. Therefore, the application of drone thermography, which can be used to create digital geometry, is explored for an automated building inspection. This application has the advantages of reducing time, labor, and safety concerns for inspection activities while solving problems of inaccessible building envelope components. Consequently, we used Infrared Thermal cameras installed on an Unmanned Aerial System to collect thermal images from building sites. The proposed workflow was started with designing a drone flight path for data collection, followed by implementing computer vision algorithms to analyze the data to identify thermal anomalies of building envelope. The paper examined a campus building in Syracuse, New York. Thermal anomalies related to cases of beam to wall thermal bridge, material degradation, and air leakage were successfully detected for the case study. Additionally, the proposed approach may be integrated with building simulation toward enriching building energy assessment. This study contributes to solve problems associated with productivity in the construction sector and to improve commercial inspection efficiency.",
          "Building facade inspection and maintenance needs to be carried out periodically, and the detection of cracks is a core component of the inspection process. The current inspection procedure is labor-intensive and time-consuming and poses significant safety issues like falling from height. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with computer vision techniques represent a promising approach for visual crack inspection on high-rise building facades. One research challenge to achieving automated visual crack inspection is image degradation in the form of motion blur caused by UAVs during image acquisition. Motion blur arises due to excessive vibrations of the UAV platform, and this may adversely affect crack detection. In this paper, a deep learning-based deblurring model based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed to address this challenge. Further, by recognizing a strong correlation between blurred and sharpened crack images, the idea of using a localized skip connection is introduced. Experimental validation of the proposed deblurring model is carried out by investigating the impact of skip connections on deblurring. The proposed model is also compared against the state-of-the-art deblurring model, and results indicate that the proposed model is able to achieve significant improvements in deblurring performance in terms of both global structure and feature details in crack images.",
          "This paper discusses the automatic texturing of building facades from thermal infrared image sequences. A fully automatic method is presented to refine GPS based positions estimating relative orientations of the image sequences including a given building model in a bundle adjustment process. The resulting refined orientation parameters are used to extract partial facade textures from all images and all sequences. The resulting partial textures of every sequence are combined to get complete facade textures in the thermal infrared domain. Textures from different image sequences are combined for object detection and extraction. These sequences are acquired either at different times for different radiometric thermal behavior of facade objects or with different viewing directions for objects located before or behind the facade plane.",
          "Methods employed for surveying buildings for condition have traditionally been reliant upon visual assessment and manual recording. Survey of traditional masonry also ostensibly conforms to this approach but, due to the sheer volume of masonry units composing walls, it is often prohibitively time consuming, exceptionally complex and ultimately costly. Notable features of such survey work for ashlar stone types require each stone to be labelled and overlaid with information relative to condition. Further hindering these already costly operations, it has been shown that the accuracy of reporting, including labelling the manifestation of defects and defect diagnosis, is subjective, depending upon the expertise and experience of those evaluating the fabric. Moving beyond these preliminary survey and reporting stages, this situation gives rise to variable repair and maintenance strategies that can have significant cost implications and can debase fundamental conservation activities. The development of digital technologies, such as terrestrial laser scanning, and advancements in novel computer vision statistical techniques can help produce accurate representation of buildings that can be subsequently rapidly processed, achieving many tangible survey functions with greater inherent objectivity. In this paper, an innovative strategy for automatic detection and classification of defects in digitised ashlar masonry walling is presented. The classification method is based on the use of supervised machine learning algorithms, assisted by surveyors' strategies and expertise to identify defective individual masonry units, through to broader global patterns for groups of stones. The proposed approach has been tested on the main facade of the Chapel Royal in Stirling Castle (Scotland), demonstrating its potential for ashlar masonry forms of wall construction. It is important to recognise that the findings are not limited to this culturally significant building and will be of high value to almost innumerable ashlar-built structures worldwide. The research ultimately attempts to reduce the degree of subjectivity in classifying defects, on a scale and rapidity hitherto beyond traditional project cost constraints. Importantly, it is recognised that through automation more effective utilisation of resources that would have been traditionally spent on survey can be redeployed to support fabric intervention or routine maintenance operations.",
          "Oblique aerial images offer views of both building roofs and facades, and thus have been recognized as a potential source to detect severe building damages caused by destructive disaster events such as earthquakes. Therefore, they represent an important source of information for first responders or other stakeholders involved in the post-disaster response process. Several automated methods based on supervised learning have already been demonstrated for damage detection using oblique airborne images. However, they often do not generalize well when data from new unseen sites need to be processed, hampering their practical use. Reasons for this limitation include image and scene characteristics, though the most prominent one relates to the image features being used for training the classifier. Recently features based on deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been shown to be more effective than conventional hand-crafted features, and have become the state-of-the-art in many domains, including remote sensing. Moreover, often oblique images are captured with high block overlap, facilitating the generation of dense 3D point clouds - an ideal source to derive geometric characteristics. We hypothesized that the use of CNN features, either independently or in combination with 3D point cloud features, would yield improved performance in damage detection. To this end we used CNN and 3D features, both independently and in combination, using images from manned and unmanned aerial platforms over several geographic locations that vary significantly in terms of image and scene characteristics. A multiple-kernel-learning framework, an effective way for integrating features from different modalities, was used for combining the two sets of features for classification. The results are encouraging: while CNN features produced an average classification accuracy of about 91%, the integration of 3D point cloud features led to an additional improvement of about 3% (i.e. an average classification accuracy of 94%). The significance of 3D point cloud features becomes more evident in the model transferability scenario (i.e., training and testing samples from different sites that vary slightly in the aforementioned characteristics), where the integration of CNN and 3D point cloud features significantly improved the model transferability accuracy up to a maximum of 7% compared with the accuracy achieved by CNN features alone. Overall, an average accuracy of 85% was achieved for the model transferability scenario across all experiments. Our main conclusion is that such an approach qualifies for practical use.",
          "Cracks in building facades are inevitable due to the age of the building. Cracks found in the building facade may be further exacerbated if not corrected immediately. Considering the extensive size of some buildings, there is definitely a need to automate the inspection routine to facilitate the inspection process. The incorporation of deep learning technology for the classification of images has proven to be an effective method in many past civil infrastructures like pavements and bridges. There is, however, limited research in the built environment sector. In order to align with the Smart Nation goals of the country, the use of Smart technologies is necessary in the building and construction industry. The focus of the study is to identify the effectiveness of deep learning technology for image classification. Deep learning technology, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), requires a large amount of data in order to obtain good performance. It is, however, difficult to collect the images manually. This study will cover the transfer learning approach, where image classification can be carried out even with limited data. Using the CNN method achieved an accuracy level of about 89%, while using the transfer learning model achieved an accuracy of 94%. Based on this, it can be concluded that the transfer learning method achieves better performance as compared to the CNN method with the same amount of data input.",
          "The article focuses on utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to capture and classify building facades of various forms of cultural sites and structures. We propose a Pareto-optimized deep learning algorithm for building detection and classification in a congested urban environment. Outdoor image processing becomes difficult in typical European metropolitan situations due to dynamically changing weather conditions as well as various objects obscuring perspectives (wires, overhangs, posts, other building parts, etc.), therefore, we also investigated the influence of such ambient noise. The approach was tested on 8768 UAV photographs shot at different angles and aimed at very different 611 buildings in the city of Vilnius (Wilno). The total accuracy was 98.41% in clear view settings, 88.11% in rain, and 82.95% when the picture was partially blocked by other objects and in the shadows. The algorithm's robustness was also tested on the Harward UAV dataset containing images of buildings taken from above (roofs) while our approach was trained using images taken at an angle (facade still visible). Our approach was still able to achieve acceptable 88.6% accuracy in building detection, yet the network showed lower accuracy when assigning the correct facade class as images lacked necessary facade information.",
          "IRT (Infrared Thermography) is a commonly used non-destructive testing method for detecting thermal anomalies of a building envelope that may cause heat loss and occupant discomfort. Despite its importance, a thermal anomaly is still usually detected by manual analysis of IRT, which strongly depends on the analyzer?s experience. In this study, an automatic anomaly detection framework from thermal and visible images was developed. The wall, which is the subject of anomaly detection, is segmented from the visible image by a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). The temperature threshold of the anomaly area is determined from the multimodal temperature distribution of the target domain. The performance of the anomaly detection was improved by applying the segmentation process (F1 score 0.497 to 0.808). The framework proposed in this study is expected to be implemented through portable devices and enable instant in-situ thermal anomaly detection.",
          "In the United States, buildings' heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems account for approximately 40% of the global energy consumption, and contribute between 40% and 48% of the CO2 emissions. One of the largest causes for this type of energy consumption is heat loss. Energy loss can be attributed to inefficiency and sub-surface defects in the structure that reduce the thermal resistance and facilitate unwanted heat transmission within the environment. In recent years, infrared (IR) thermography has proven to be an excellent tool for detecting heat loss from a building envelope. At the same time, advancements in computer vision systems have enabled the use of Structure from Motion (SfM) as a photogrammetry technique. SfM is used for the generation of three-dimensional (3D) building information modeling (BIM). It has the potential to facilitate remote visual inspection of large-scale structures and infrastructure systems by creating virtual renderings. The results of an experiment performed on a lab-scale building using both IR and SfM techniques is analyzed. In particular, the accuracy of SfM in generating a 3D virtual rendering of a target object by using images acquired from a low-cost IR camera is discussed. IR images of a building are recorded and are used for reconstructing a digital model of the structure. The goal is to characterize the viability of SfM in detecting sub-surface defects that can yield to significant heat loss and reduce thermal efficiency in the facade of the building.",
          "Graffiti is common in many communities and even affects our historical and heritage structures. This leads to a decrease in the revenue associated with commercial activities or services (e.g., shops, restaurants, residences), and potentially reduces tourism in a region. Visual data, in the form of photographs, is becoming an efficient mechanism to record information. Photographs can be quickly captured, and are already frequently posted online by ordinary citizens (e.g., tourists, residents, visitors). Exploiting image data through automation and computer vision provides a new opportunity to simplify the current manual graffiti-monitoring processes, enabling automated detection, localization, and quantification of such markings. In this study, we developed a vision-based graffiti-detection technique using a convolutional neural network. Images collected from historical structures of interest within a community can be utilized to automatically inspect for graffiti markings. In the case in which citizens collect and contribute data, there is a high degree of duplication and repetition, and potentially a lack of GPS information. These hinder the direct use of the images for automating the process. To address these challenges, we built high-resolution, single-view facade images (orthophotos) before applying our robust graffiti detector. The robust graffiti detector was built using a database with 1022 images of damaged or contaminated structures gathered during a recent European Union project, entitled Safeguarding Cultural Heritage through Technical and Organisational Resources Management (STORM). A total of 818 images were used for training (10% of the training set was randomly chosen for the validation set), achieving 88% accuracy among the remaining 204 samples for testing. Using the trained detector, the technique developed was demonstrated using data collected from the Church of Agios Nikolaos (Leontariou), Kantza, Greece.",
          "High moisture content is a common problem of adhered glazed ceramic cladding. It leads to further problems such as biological growth, delamination and efflorescence. Increased moisture also affects users' indoor comfort and more energy is needed for heating due to higher thermal conductivity. Therefore, it is useful to detect it before visible signs occur and this is possible with infrared thermography. A quasi-quantitative approach based on time-dependent infrared thermographic inspection and thermogram analysis by quantitative methods was tested in an adhered ceramic facade where rising damp had already been identified. Simple image subtraction (SIS), nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and principal component analysis (PCA) were the quantitative methods tested for the analysis of thermograms. Hammer-tapping control and surface moisture measurements were the auxiliary techniques used to assess the results. Comparative assessments showed that the quasi-quantitative approach using PCA has great potential to detect changes in moisture and also to eliminate false indications caused by unavoidable reflection and shading. The results obtained by SIS and NMF on the other hand, had limited performance in showing areas with high moisture content. ",
          "As a transparent and traditional building material, glass products such as glass facade are vital components of buildings. However, the surface scratches generated in the manufacturing process or emerging in the service stage such as windborne debris impacts may lead to remarkable strength degradation of glass material. In order to assess the fracture possibility of glass components, the size and number of scratches should be monitored during their lifecycle. Automatic scratch detection of architectural glass therefore remains a necessary task for civil engineers. A pixel-level instance segmentation model using Mask and region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) was proposed for scratches detection on transparent glass surface. Images with scratches were firstly collected by a tailor-made automated microscopic camera scanning system to build the training and validation dataset. Test results demonstrate that the trained network is satisfactory, achieving a mean average precision of 96.5% with low missing and false rate under background interference. A comparison between the proposed model and another segmentation method YOLACT indicates that the proposed model has better performance in both detection and segmentation accuracy. The proposed deep learning-based approach can better support the development of non-contact defect assessment techniques for transparent building materials such as glass.",
          "One of the most common pathologies in exposed brick facades is efflorescence, which, although they often have a similar appearance, their effects and way of solving them can range from a one-off cleaning to a repair that involves adding or replacing the material. Therefore, the novel goal of this work is to verify whether it is possible to automate this task of distinguishing what type of intervention each brick needs. To do this, the methodology followed focuses on proposing, training and validating a deep convolutional neural network with the real-time end-to-end method that simultaneously predicts multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes. For this, images of 765 building facades will be used, of which 392 were selected, proceeding to label 4704 bricks, resulting in that the model achieved a mAP maximum at epoch 100 with 0.894, which is therefore of interest for the creation of intervention maps.",
          "Structural disaster damage detection and characterisation is one of the oldest remote sensing challenges, and the utility of virtually every type of active and passive sensor deployed on various air- and spaceborne platforms has been assessed. The proliferation and growing sophistication of UAV in recent years has opened up many new opportunities for damage mapping, due to the high spatial resolution, the resulting stereo images and derivatives, and the flexibility of the platform. We have addressed the problem in the context of two European research projects, RECONASS and INACHUS. In this paper we synthesize and evaluate the progress of 6 years of research focused on advanced image analysis that was driven by progress in computer vision, photogrammetry and machine learning, but also by constraints imposed by the needs of first responder and other civil protection end users. The projects focused on damage to individual buildings caused by seismic activity but also explosions, and our work centred on the processing of 3D point cloud information acquired from stereo imagery. Initially focusing on the development of both supervised and unsupervised damage detection methods built on advanced texture features and basic classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Random Forest, the work moved on to the use of deep learning. In particular the coupling of image-derived features and 3D point cloud information in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) proved successful in detecting also subtle damage features. In addition to the detection of standard rubble and debris, CNN-based methods were developed to detect typical facade damage indicators, such as cracks and spalling, including with a focus on multi-temporal and multi-scale feature fusion. We further developed a processing pipeline and mobile app to facilitate near-real time damage mapping. The solutions were tested in a number of pilot experiments and evaluated by a variety of stakeholders.",
          "Crack detection in masonry facades is a crucial task for ensuring the safety and longevity of buildings. However, traditional methods are often time-consuming, expensive, and labourintensive. In recent years, deep learning techniques have been applied to detect cracks in masonry images, but these models often require large amounts of annotated data to achieve high accuracy, which can be difficult to obtain. In this article, we propose a deep learning approach for crack detection on brickwork masonry facades using transfer learning with limited annotated data. Our approach uses a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network model as a feature extractor, which is then optimised specifically for crack detection. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we created and curated a dataset of 700 brickwork masonry facade images, and used 500 images for training, 100 for validation, and the remaining 100 images for testing. Results showed that our approach is very effective in detecting cracks, achieving an accuracy and F1-score of up to 100% when following end-to-end training of the neural network, thus being a promising solution for building inspection and maintenance, particularly in situations where annotated data is limited. Moreover, the transfer learning approach can be easily adapted to different types of masonry facades, making it a versatile tool for building inspection and maintenance.",
          "Accurate assessment of building damage is very important for disaster response and rescue. Traditional damage detection techniques using 2D features at a single observing angle cannot objectively and accurately reflect the structural damage conditions. With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetric techniques and 3D point processing, automatic and accurate damage detection for building roof and facade has become a research hotspot in recent work. In this paper, we propose a building damage detection framework based on the boundary refined supervoxel segmentation and random forest-latent Dirichlet allocation classification. First, the traditional supervoxel segmentation method is improved to segment the point clouds into good boundary refined supervoxels. Then, non-building points such as ground and vegetation are removed from the generated supervoxels. Next, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model is used to construct the high-level feature representation for each building supervoxel based on the selected 2D image and 3D point features. Finally, LDA model and random forest algorithm are employed to identify the damaged building regions. This method is applied to oblique photogrammetric point clouds collected from the Beichuan Country Earthquake Site. The research achieves the 3D damage assessment for building facade and roof. The result demonstrates that the proposed framework is capable of achieving around 94% accuracy for building point extraction and around 90% accuracy for damage identification. Moreover, both of the precision and recall for building damage detection reached around 89%. Concluded from comparison analysis, the proposed method improved the damage detection accuracy and the highest improvement ratio is over 8%.",
          "Visual evaluation of facade condition plays an important role to ensure the structural health of the whole building. To automatically achieve visual evaluation of facade condition with high accuracy, current studies have applied various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to classify, localize, and segment the defects. However, the methods in previous research mainly focused on accuracy improvement rather than providing effective evaluations of defects according to the requirement of industry standards. Therefore, this study proposes a rule-based deep learning method to achieve evaluation-oriented facade defects detection, which can be used to provide effective evaluation areas containing the necessary information (e.g., type, location, quantity, and size of facade defects) for condition evaluation. First, annotation rules for classification, segmentation, and localization are designed to instruct the manual annotation work and automatically adjust the bounding boxes into effective evaluation areas. Then, a proposal weighting rule is developed to be combined with the deep learning model during the model training process to improve the accuracy and stability of the predictions. A rectification rule is further used to adjust the raw predictions into predictions with effective evaluation areas for facade defects. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrated that using the proposed method can successfully improve the performance of facade defects detection to meet the requirement of condition evaluation. Besides, this method is tested to be adaptable to various distance settings in the requirement.",
          "Wood is considered one of the most important construction materials, as well as a natural material prone to degradation, with fungi being the main reason for wood failure in a temperate climate. Visual inspection of wood or other approaches for monitoring are time-consuming, and the incipient stages of decay are not always visible. Thus, visual decay detection and such manual monitoring could be replaced by automated real-time monitoring systems. The capabilities of such systems can range from simple monitoring, periodically reporting data, to the automatic detection of anomalous measurements that may happen due to various environmental or technical reasons. In this paper, we explore the application of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) techniques to wood Moisture Content (MC) data. Specifically, data were obtained from a wood construction that was monitored for four years using sensors at different positions. Our experimental results prove the validity of these techniques to detect both artificial and real anomalies in MC signals, encouraging further research to enable their deployment in real use cases.",
          "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently become popular in building facade inspections to maintain a safe and well-performed built environment. A camera-equipped UAV system can capture numerous high-resolution facade images for close-up visual inspections. However, in several cases, the multispectrum and spatiotemporal data collected by UAVs are not systematically documented and utilized, which obstructs the automation in the identification, localization, assessment, and tracking of facade anomalies. This paper develops an integrated, computational GIS-based information system to provide automated storage, retrieval, detection, assessment, and documentation of facade anomalies based on UAV-captured data. The developed system creates user-friendly access to diverse professional imagery analysis tools from external artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. A real-world case was studied to present the procedure and advances in the management and analysis of multisourced inspection data to automate UAV-based facade diagnosis. As a result, the proposed method facilitates the seamless fusion, processing, visualization, and documentation of multimodal inspection data, resulting in convenient analysis with discrepancies measured in decimeters for length, millimeters for width, and centimeters for geoposition. This contributes to the understanding of facade conditions and decision-making of timely maintenance throughout a building's service lifecycle.",
          "Cracks are pathologies whose appearance in ceramic tiles can cause various damages due to the coating system losing water tightness and impermeability functions. Besides, the detachment of a ceramic plate, exposing the building structure, can still reach people who move around the building. Manual inspection is the most common method for addressing this problem. However, it depends on the knowledge and experience of those who perform the analysis and demands a long time and a high cost to map the entire area. This work focuses on automated optical inspection to find faults in ceramic tiles performing the segmentation of cracks in ceramic images using deep learning to segment these defects. We propose an architecture for segmenting cracks in facades with Deep Learning that includes an image pre-processing step. We also propose the Ceramic Crack Database, a set of images to segment defects in ceramic tiles. The proposed model can adequately identify the crack even when it is close to or within the grout.",
          "Featured Application The method proposed in this paper is suitable for application in the condition assessment of inaccessible building facades or high-rise and large structures of all kinds. Building facade assessment could be performed in a more efficient way using a multidisciplinary approach and modern technologies. This study proposes the orthofacade-based assisted inspection method (AIM), universal and applicable to different types of facade cladding and suitable for application in the condition assessment of inaccessible building facades or high-rise and large structures of all kinds. The AIM method offers a multidisciplinary approach by combining unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, electronic tachymetry, and digital image processing techniques (photogrammetry and open-source computer vision methods). The method was verified in a case study performed on a high-rise building facade. On-site data acquisition of high-resolution images of facade and control points was conducted by UAV and tachymetry. The data were further processed in photogrammetric software in order to generate a georeferenced orthofacade. Crack detection was performed at pixel level via computer code using the OpenCV library methods. The established diagnostic model, defined by control points, enables precise determination of crack location. Crack length, width, or area could be calculated based on the coordinates of its points, by performing simple mathematical operations. The AIM method provides automation of crack detection and precise determination of location and geometrical parameters of detected crack.",
          "In order for a risk assessment to deliver sensible results, exposure in the concerned area must be known or at least estimated in a reliable manner. Exposure estimation, though, may be tricky, especially in urban areas, where large-scale surveying is generally expensive and impractical; yet, it is in urban areas that most assets are at stake when a disaster strikes. Authoritative sources such as cadastral data and business records may not be readily accessible to private stakeholders such as insurance companies; airborne and especially satellite-based Earth-Observation data obviously cannot retrieve all relevant pieces of information. Recently, a growing interest is recorded in the exploitation of street-level pictures, procured either through crowdsourcing or through specialized services like Google Street View. Pictures of building facades convey a great amount of information, but their interpretation is complex. Recently, however, smarter image analysis methods based on deep learning started appearing in literature, made possible by the increasing availability of computational power. In this paper, we leverage such methods to design a system for large-scale, systematic scanning of street-level pictures intended to map floor numbers in urban buildings. Although quite simple, this piece of information is a relevant exposure proxy in risk assessment. In the proposed system, a series of georeferenced images are automatically retrieved from the repository where they sit. A tailored deep learning net is first trained on sample images tagged through visual interpretation, and then systematically applied to the entire retrieved dataset. A specific algorithm allows attaching number of floors tags to the correct building in a dedicated GIS (Geographic Information System) layer, which is finally output by the system as an exposure proxy layer.",
          "Facade tiles of buildings are likely to weaken, crack, or fall off due to aging or out of natural causes such as temperature variations during daytime and nighttime and earthquakes. Tile spalling of tall buildings often leads to accidents or even severe casualties. In view that a routine thorough inspection is costly, this study aims to develop a cost-effective means to detect facade tile degradation of tall buildings through machine learning. We leverage a drone to film outer walls of high-rise buildings at several dozens of sites, from which training data are produced for learning and validation. We resort to a convolutional neural network with deep learning capabilities that is trained with sufficient knowledge to identify hazardous conditions of cracked tiles in two or three levels. Core to our implementation is Jetson TX2-an embedded system-which is programmed in light of AlexNet over Keras and TensorFlow, opensource libraries for deep neural network programming. To heighten learning quality subject to limited amount of training data, image preprocessing involving gray-level transformation, thresholding, and morphological operations is introduced. Experimental results corroborate that our scheme achieves a correct classification rate of over 86%. Our development serves a moderate approach to deep learning in daily contexts, a practical scenario over which to inspire other applications.",
          "There is a growing trend in the application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems for visual inspection of building facades. Current practices remain at a low efficiency to manage the large amount of UAV-collected close-range facade images to support the inspection and documentation of facade anomalies such as cracks and corrosions. This paper proposes a GIS-based two-step procedure to streamline the process of the management of UAV-collected images for supporting building facade inspection. First, a 2D GIS spatial model of building facades is created by net-unfolding facade surfaces around the building footprint in GIS to store the geometric and geographic information of building facades. Then, the UAV-collected images are automatically geo-registered to the 2D GIS spatial model through computer vision techniques applied in GIS. An experimental case study is also presented to demonstrate the process and evaluate the performance of the proposed method. It is demonstrated that the GIS-based spatial model of net-unfolded building facades allows for an efficient and effective registration of UAV-captured close-range facade images without apparent loss of pixel data. Provided with image data processing capabilities to detect and assess facade anomalies, the proposed GIS-based workflow can contribute to an automated documentation of UAV-based facade inspections to support the decision-making of further maintenance actions.",
          "Remote sensing images have long been recognized as useful for the detection of building damages, mainly due to their wide coverage, revisit capabilities and high spatial resolution. The majority of contributions aimed at identifying debris and rubble piles, as the main focus is to assess collapsed and partially collapsed structures. However, these approaches might not be optimal for the image classification of facade damages, where damages might appear in the form of spalling, cracks and collapse of small segments of the facade. A few studies focused their damage detection on the facades using only post-event images. Nonetheless, several studies achieved better performances in damage detection approaches when considering multi-temporal image data. Hence, in this work a multi-temporal facade damage detection is tested. The first objective is to optimally merge pre- and post-event aerial oblique imagery within a supervised classification approach using convolutional neural networks to detect facade damages. The second objective is related to the fact that facades are normally depicted in several views in aerial manned photogrammetric surveys; hence, different procedures combining these multi-view image data are also proposed and embedded in the image classification approach. Six multi-temporal approaches are compared against 3 mono-temporal ones. The results indicate the superiority of multi-temporal approaches (up to similar to 25% in f1-score) when compared to the mono-temporal ones. The best performing multi-temporal approach takes as input sextuples (3 views per epoch, per facade) within a late fusion approach to perform the image classification of facade damages. However, the detection of small damages, such as smaller cracks or smaller areas of spalling, remains challenging in this approach, mainly due to the low resolution (similar to 0.14 m ground sampling distance) of the dataset used.",
          "Despite advanced construction technologies that are unceasingly filling the city-skylines with glassy high-rise structures, maintenance of these shining tall monsters has remained a high-risk labor-intensive process. Thus, nowadays, utilizing fa ade-cleaning robots seems inevitable. However, in case of navigating on cracked glass, these robots may cause hazardous situations. Accordingly, it seems necessary to equip them with crack-detection system to eventually avoid cracked area. In this study, benefitting from convolutional neural networks developed in TensorFlow (TM), a deep-learning-based crack detection approach is introduced for a novel modular facade-cleaning robot. For experimental purposes, the robot is equipped with an on-board camera and the live video is loaded using OpenCV. The vision-based training process is fulfilled by applying two different optimizers utilizing a sufficiently generalized data-set. Data augmentation techniques and also image pre-processing also apply as a part of process. Simulation and experimental results show that the system can hit the milestone on crack-detection with an accuracy around 90%. This is satisfying enough to replace human-conducted on-site inspections. In addition, a thorough comparison between the performance of optimizers is put forward: Adam optimizer shows higher precision, while Adagrad serves more satisfying recall factor, however, Adam optimizer with the lowest false negative rate and highest accuracy has a better performance. Furthermore, proposed CNN's performance is compared to traditional NN and the results provide a remarkable difference in success level, proving the strength of CNN.",
          "Targeted energy management and control is becoming an increasing concern in the building sector. Automatic analyses of thermal data, which minimize the subjectivity of the assessment and allow for large-scale inspections, are therefore of high interest. In this study, we propose an approach for a supervised extraction of facade openings (windows and doors) from photogrammetric 3D point clouds attributed to RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) information. The novelty of the proposed approach is in the combination of thermal information with other available characteristics of data for a classification performed directly in 3D space. Images acquired in visible and thermal infrared spectra serve as input data for the camera pose estimation and the reconstruction of 3D scene geometry. To investigate the relevance of different information types to the classification performance, a Random Forest algorithm is applied to various sets of computed features. The best feature combination is then used as an input for a Conditional Random Field that enables us to incorporate contextual information and consider the interaction between the points. The evaluation executed on a per-point level shows that the fusion of all available information types together with context consideration allows us to extract objects with 90% completeness and 95% correctness. A respective assessment executed on a per-object level shows 97% completeness and 88% accuracy.",
          "This paper describes a new concept to automatically characterize building types in urban areas based on publicly available image databases, making parts of seismic risk assessment more time and cost-effective, and improving the reliability of seismic risk assessment, especially in regions where building stock information is currently not documented. One of the main steps in evaluating potential human and economic losses in a seismic risk assessment, is the development of inventory databases for existing building stocks in terms of load-resisting structural systems and material characteristics (building typologies classification). The common approach for building stock model classification is to perform extensive fieldwork and walk-down surveys in representative areas of a city, and in some cases using random sample surveys of geounits. This procedure is time and cost consuming, and subject to personal interpretation: to mitigate these costs, we have introduced a machine learning methodology to automate this classification based on publicly available image databases. We here use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically identify the different building typologies in the city of Oslo, Norway, based on facade images taken from in-situ fieldwork and from Google Street View. We use transfer learning of state-of-the-art pretrained CNNs to predict the Model Building Typology. The present article attempts to categorize Oslo's building stock in five main building typologies: timber, unreinforced masonry, reinforced concrete, composite (steel-reinforced concrete) and steel. This method results in 89% accuracy score for timber buildings, though only 35% success score for steel-reinforced concrete buildings. We here classify and define for the first time a relevant set of five typologies for the Norwegian building typologies as observed in Oslo and applicable at national level. In addition, this study shows that CNNs can significantly contribute in terms of developing a cost-effective building stock model.",
          "This study proposes a novel bounding-box object augmentation (BoxAug) method to improve the performance of deep learning models in detecting defects in residential building facades. The most significant characteristic of the method is that it augments objects in images, rather than augmenting images, to solve the data imbalance problem. Moreover, it employs the bounding-box form for object detection, instead of the segmentation mask form. To evaluate the method, 7635 images obtained using unmanned aerial vehicles were utilized as the original training dataset. The faster region-based convolutional neural network model trained with the augmented training dataset using the method exhibited better performance than the model trained with the original dataset. Particularly, the class with the least objects in the original dataset displayed a markedly improved performance. Thus, the method can serve as an auxiliary method for effectively augmenting real-world image datasets with an unbalanced number of objects.",
          "Building structural type information is the foundation for seismic risk assessment and management since it reflects the behavior of buildings under seismic load. However, in earthquake-prone regions, most of this information is out-of-date or nonexistent. This paper proposes a deep learning-based method for automatically identifying building structural types from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) oblique images. The method consists of four steps: (1) collect facades of buildings with different structural types by web crawler technology as a sample set; (2) construct a convolutional neural network with a facade prior knowledge attention branch and train the model using the sample set; (3) extract building facades from UAV oblique images based on the georeferencing results of feature points as the test set; (4) identify building structural types by inputting the test set into the trained model. Three cases have been selected to verify the feasibility and applicability of the method. The average recall rate of 85% and the average F1 score of 83% have been achieved in areas with regular building distribution. This method integrates multidisciplinary knowledge to provide a solution for rapid collection of building vulnerability information, and expands the role of oblique photography data in urban management and disaster prevention planning.",
          "Defects in residential building facades affect the structural integrity of buildings and degrade external appearances. Defects in a building facade are typically managed using manpower during maintenance. This approach is time-consuming, yields subjective results, and can lead to accidents or casualties. To address this, we propose a building facade monitoring system that utilizes an object detection method based on deep learning to efficiently manage defects by minimizing the involvement of manpower. The dataset used for training a deep-learning-based network contains actual residential building facade images. Various building designs in these raw images make it difficult to detect defects because of their various types and complex backgrounds. We employed the faster regions with convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) structure for more accurate defect detection in such environments, achieving an average precision (intersection over union (IoU) = 0.5) of 62.7% for all types of trained defects. As it is difficult to detect defects in a training environment, it is necessary to improve the performance of the network. However, the object detection network employed in this study yields an excellent performance in complex real-world images, indicating the possibility of developing a system that would detect defects in more types of building facades.",
          "Building inspection is a critical issue for designing rehabilitation projects, which are recently gaining importance for environmental and energy efficiency reasons. Image sensors on-board unmanned aerial vehicles are a powerful tool for building inspection, given the diversity and complexity of facades and materials, and mainly, their vertical disposition. The UBRISTES (UAV-based Building Rehabilitation with vISible and ThErmal infrared remote Sensing) system is proposed as an effective solution for facade inspection in urban areas, validating a method for the simultaneous acquisition of visible and thermal aerial imaging applied to the detection of the main types of facade anomalies/pathologies, and showcasing its possibilities using a first principles analysis. Two public buildings have been considered for evaluating the proposed system. UBRISTES is ready to use in building inspection and has been proved as a useful tool in the design of rehabilitation projects for inaccessible, complex building structures in the context of energy efficiency.",
          "Manual inspections of glass facade of high rising buildings are expensive, time-consuming and potentially life-threatening for both inspectors and pedestrians on the street. Advances in machine learning for image/video analysis and availability of affordable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with onboard video recording and processing sensors provide opportunities for smart, safe and automatic glass facade inspections. This paper is concerned with developing an effective solution for recognizing cracked glass panels, which can be installed on board a UAV. From static 2D photographic images, the proposed solution analyzes textural patterns of smooth glass surface and crack segments, linearity of detected crack segments, geometrical characteristics of crack curvatures and the crack pixel patterns, captures these discriminative features for glass cracks using Uniform Local Binary Pattern (ULBP), histograms of linearity, geometrical curvature descriptors with fixed length connected pixel configurations, and accordingly classifies images of cracked and non-cracked glass panels using a kNN classifier. Experimental results with images of different resolutions acquired by a UAV drone in a real office building setting and images collected through Google search demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves promising results with accuracy rates in excess of 80% and even as high as 91% despite the presence of reflections.",
          "Most current research deals with line following at an aerial position with respect to the target object. We address a task scenario of close-up inspection on vertical surfaces. Line following is a basic component for the close-up inspection process on high rise structures, such as building facade, tower skeleton, and wind turbine blade. The inspection process may also require slower and accurate line following movement for anomaly detection in higher resolution. In this paper, we formulate the problem of accurate line following on vertical surfaces. We propose the carrot in probabilistic grid algorithm for accurate line following on vertical surfaces and work through a refinement for performance improvement. We implemented the carrot in probabilistic grid algorithm on a ready-to-fly quadrotor (micro rotary UAV) and evaluated the line following performance with several forms of geometric line segments on a vertical surface. Experimental results based on extensive actual flight tests show satisfactory performance of the carrot in probabilistic grid algorithm over the benchmark line following algorithm.",
          "Facade defect classification based on deep learning has made great progresses in recent years. However, deep learning models commonly need abundant labeled data for training, and it could be impractical and expensive to collect sufficient labeled samples for all classes of defects. Sometimes, there are only a few samples in rare classes, which are not able to support the training process. In addition, common classifiers based on deep learning cannot easily extend their recognition classes and thus cannot classify unseen classes with only a few samples. Therefore, to overcome the problem of insufficient data and the extension constraint of the classifier, a few-shot classification method based on an extensible classifier and contrastive learning is proposed to recognize unseen classes with limited (1, 2 or 5) samples. The extensible classifier implemented by imprinting weights can easily extend the model to classify unseen classes with a few samples. Meanwhile, contrastive learning, which is a complementary task in training, is used to enrich the model's generalization and representation on unseen classes. Besides, a hard negative mining (HNM) method is introduced to address the imbalanced data in contrastive learning and further improve accuracies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the few-shot classification accuracy with only 1 sample from 35.8% to 63.5% on novel and unseen classes, and from 73.1% to 82.1% on all classes, while maintaining a high and comparable accuracy (89.6%) on base classes.",
          "Facade defects not only detract from the building's aesthetics but also compromise its performance. Furthermore, they potentially endanger pedestrians, occupants, and property. Existing deep-learning-based methodologies are facing some challenges in terms of recognition speed and model complexity. An improved YOLOv7 method, named BFD-YOLO, is proposed to ensure the accuracy and speed of building facade defects detection in this paper. Firstly, the original ELAN module in YOLOv7 was substituted with a lightweight MobileOne module to diminish the quantity of parameters and enhance the speed of inference. Secondly, the coordinate attention module was added to the model to enhance feature extraction capability. Next, the SCYLLA-IoU was used to expedite the rate of convergence and increase the recall of the model. Finally, we have extended the open datasets to construct a building facade damage dataset that includes three typical defects. BFD-YOLO demonstrates excellent accuracy and efficiency based on this dataset. Compared to YOLOv7, BFD-YOLO's precision and mAP@.5 are improved by 2.2% and 2.9%, respectively, while maintaining comparable efficiency. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method obtained higher detection accuracy with guaranteed real-time performance.",
          "Many tiles on facade of historic temples are damaged and deteriorated due to aging and environmental factors. Regular inspection is required for proper maintenance and automatic inspection offers a significant advantage over manual inspection as it is efficient and accurate. Many previous studies are focus on detecting damages in factory tiles for the quality control purposes, although there has not been much study on tile damages for historical temples. This paper proposed an image-based system to detect damages in tiles using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on a temple facade. The dataset was created by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and a digital camera from a historical temple in Bangkok, Thailand. In the proposed work, CNN was trained on various image patches sizes. The detection accuracy of the system was found to be 95% in the validation data and 91% on the testing data. The results of the proposed system were compared with a system using hand-crafted features, including 2D wavelet transforms with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The proposed system shows that the CNN approach is more accurate than the traditional handcrafted method.",

The city of Al-Salt in Jordan was selected for the case study in this research. The best model showed an average damage detection accuracy of 95%. It was demonstrated that the proposed CNN model was significantly powerful, effective and reliable for damage detection of historic masonry buildings using features' extraction based on imaging, and it contributed to the management and safety of historic heritage and preservation.",
          "This paper describes a new approach for image-based modeling based on thermographic images and applied to efficiency energy studies of building facades. The approach is automatic and allows obtaining thermographic 3D models and orthoimages, which can be used to assess energy efficiency of building facades. The classical photogrammetry approach is reinforced and combined with computer vision algorithms, especially for the processes of image matching and dense surface generation, so that they have a robust performance with thermographic images. Experimental results presented here demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach using the Polytechnic Advanced School of Avila (Spain) as a case of study. ",
          "One common objective in computer vision and photogrammetry is to infer higher level object structure which is not directly observable in images or other sensing data. A practical problem field for such research is seismic building damage assessment. It is possible to observe objects such as facades, roofs, or rubble piles in oblique airborne images, but whether they are part of an actually intact or destroyed building is not observable directly: only the spatial relation between those directly observable objects allows conclusions about the structural integrity of a building. In this paper we present an approach to seismic building damage assessment, where a graph-based learning technique is employed to detect and to classify building damage levels, given instances of four object classes derived by supervised classification in object space. Results show that the vague building damage level description leads to relatively low classification score (52%), when a pre-defined building outline is assumed. However, if one is independent from such a pre-segmentation, the detection and classification rate is higher (70%).",
          "The new Construction 4.0 paradigm takes advantage of existing technologies. In this scope, the development and application of image-based methods for evaluating and monitoring the state of conservation of buildings has shown significant growth, including support for maintenance plans. Recently, powerful algorithms have been applied to automatically evaluate the state of conservation of buildings using deep learning frameworks, which are utilised as a black-box approach. The large amount of data required for training, the difficulty in generalising, and the lack of parameters to assess the quality of the results often make it difficult for non-experts to evaluate them. For several applications and scenarios, simple and more intuitive image-based approaches can be applied to support building inspections. This paper presents the StainView, which is a fast and reliable method. The method is based on the classification of the mosaic image, computed from a systematic acquisition, and allows one to (i) map stains in facades; (ii) locate critical areas; (iii) identify materials; (iv) characterise colours; and (v) produce detailed and comprehensive maps of results. The method was validated in three identical buildings in Bairro de Alvalade, in Lisbon, Portugal, that present different levels of degradation. The comparison with visual inspection demonstrates that StainView enables the automatic location and mapping of critical areas with high efficiency, proving to be a useful tool for building inspection: differences were of approximately 5% for the facade with the worst and average state of conservation, however, the values deteriorate for the facade under good conditions, reaching the double of percentage. In terms of processing speed, StainView allows a facade mapping that is 8-12 times faster, and this difference tends to grow with the number of evaluated facades.",
          "Automated measurement of the relative pose between a crane borne curtain wall module and its installation location on the side face of a high-rise building can be applied to increase the safety and efficiency of crane operations though informing the action required to achieve alignment. However, the detection and measurement tasks are challenging because the construction site is large, unstructured, and highly dynamic. This article introduces a markerless computer vision measurement algorithm and a practical implementation, which uses a forward-facing infrared camera attached to the crane spreader. The algorithm self-verifies the measurement against known information so that it can fail safely instead of returning a malformed measurement. The algorithm is experimentally validated in challenging lighting conditions. The window frame segmentation achieved F-beta = 0.59. Overall, the algorithm returned 71% successful and 0 malformed measurements.",
          "Developments in computer vision, such as structure from motion and multiview stereo reconstruction, have enabled a range of photogrammetric applications using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based imagery. However, some specific cases still present reconstruction challenges, including survey areas composed of steep, overhanging, or vertical rock formations. Here, the suitability and geometric accuracy of four UAV-based image acquisition and data processing scenarios for topographic surveying applications in complex terrain are assessed and compared. The specific cases include the use of: 1) nadir imagery; 2) nadir and oblique imagery; 3) nadir and facade imagery; and 4) nadir, oblique, and facade imagery to reconstruct a topographically complex natural surface. Results illustrate that including oblique and facade imagery to supplement the more traditional nadir collections significantly improves the geometric accuracy of point cloud data reconstruction by approximately 35% when assessed against terrestrial laser scanning data of near-vertical rock walls. Most points (99.41%) had distance errors of less than 50 cm between the point clouds derived from the nadir imagery and nadir-oblique-facade imagery. Apart from delivering enhanced spatial resolution in facade details, the geometric accuracy improvements achieved from integrating nadir, oblique, and facade imagery provide value for a range of applications, including geotechnical and geohazard investigations. Such gains are particularly relevant for studies assessing rock integrity and stability, and engineering design, planning, and construction, where information on the position of rock cracks, joints, faults, shears, and bedding planes may be required.",
          "The increasing number of accidents arising from falling objects from the facade of tall buildings has attracted much attention globally. To regulators, a preventive approach based on a mandatory periodic facade inspection has been deemed as a necessary measure to maintain the functionality and integrity of the facade of tall buildings. Researchers worldwide have been working towards a predictive approach to allow for the assessment of the likely failure during some future period, by measuring the condition of the facade to detect latent defects and anomalies. The methods proposed include laser scanning, image-based sensing and infrared thermography to support the automatic facade visual inspection. This paper aims to review and analyse the state-of-the-art literature on the automated inspection of building facades, with emphasis on the detection and maintenance management of latent defects and anomalies for falling objects from tall buildings. A step-by-step holistic method is leveraged to retrieve the available literature from databases, followed by the analyses of relevant articles in different long-standing research themes. The types and characteristics of facade falling objects, legislations, practices and the effectiveness of various inspection techniques are discussed. Various diagnostic, inspection and analytical methods which support facade inspection and maintenance are analysed with discussion on the potential future research in this field.",
          "Facade inspection is a regular but necessary maintenance task to ensure the safety, functioning, and aesthetics of a building. Traditional visual identification of facade defects is dangerous, time-consuming, and insufficient. Based on an image dataset and deep learning algorithms, an automatic facade defects classification technique is developed in this research. A layer-based categorization rule is proposed to categorize facade defects. To handle the problem of imbalanced data size among defect classes, a meta learning-based method is applied, which reassigns weights to the training data. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed method had a stronger capacity to deal with the imbalanced dataset problem comparing with previous methods by improving the classification accuracy from 71.43% of a basic convolutional neural network (CNN) model to 82.86% of a meta learning-based CNN model.",
          "Developing a classifier to identify the defects from facade images using deep learning requires abundant labeled images. However, it is time-consuming and uneconomical to label the collected images. Hence, it is desired to train an accurate classifier with only a small amount of labeled data. Therefore, this study proposes a semi-supervised learning algorithm that uses only a small amount of labeled data for training, but still achieves high classification accuracy. In addition, based on the mean teacher algorithm, this study develops a novel uncertainty filter to select reliable unlabeled data for initial training epochs to further improve the classification accuracy. Validation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the model accuracy from 79.26% to 84.36% compared to the traditional supervised learning algorithm with 10% of labeled data in a dataset. From another perspective, compared to supervised learning algorithm, the proposed technique can help reduce the time and cost for preparing the labeled data.",
          "Annotation work is burdensome and challenging for developing a facade defects detector, especially when the raw data set is large but not all useful. To alleviate the problem, this study proposes an informativeness-guided active learning methodology to effectively select informative data to train a robust facade defects detector. A novel data annotation workflow is developed to ensure the high quality of labels. Then, an active learning-based model training strategy is adopted to enable the model to have both the abilities of generalization and discrimination on different defect features. Besides, an innovative informativeness assessment method is proposed by flexibly combining the degree of uncertainty and the degree of representativeness. Through the proposed method, the performance of facade defects detection can be further boosted with the same amount but more informative training data so that the cost-efficiency of human annotation work can be improved.",
          "Weathering, aging, infiltration, solar radiation and several other factors cause the deterioration of buildings and infrastructures and hence the need for periodical maintenance and restoration. The need for maintenance has been traditionally determined based on visual inspections of qualified operators. Since this process is obviously time consuming and quite expensive, especially when the considered building is quite large and high, then a number of recent studies have been recently published proposing remote sensing tools in order to ease the monitoring process. Among the possible spatial data acquisition sensors, terrestrial laser scanning has been considered in several of the existing studies, mostly because of its high reliability, to cope with cracks and defect detection up to the millimeter level of resolution, which is the typical accuracy of the current generation of professional laser scanners. This paper considers the problem of detecting small defects on the facade of a University building Similar to other previous studies, in this work defect detection is accomplished by considering distances with respect to a planar surface locally fitted on the building facade. Then, statistical filtering and machine learning tools have been implemented in order to cope with damage detection of the brick surfaces at sub-millimeter level.",

Our prototype measurement system, mounted on a vehicle, acquires geotagged optical and infrared images from the street-side of the buildings. A basic approach to detect gross thermal anomalies, such as thermal bridges, via a binary classifier trained on 2000 carefully labeled infrared images is demonstrated. Thermal anomalies are identified with a precision score of around 89.2 % and 75.6 % recall on a test dataset of 1184 images infrared recorded in Hergiswil (NW). The enabled automated assessment helps to identify retrofitting targets and supports increasing the renovation rate.",
          "Crack damage evaluation is a crucial index in building repair and maintenance for assessing the health of buildings. This study propose a framework for crack segmentation and damage evaluation to provide a rapid and accurate crack evaluation in practical applications. The framework consists of four steps: data set collection, training of the crack segmentation model, indicator establishment, and damage severity evaluation. Deeplabv3 + is used for crack segmentation. And different indicators are established based on connected domain analysis. To determine the severity of the crack, we establish a damage factor through hierarchical analysis. Field experiments are carried out on real buildings to assess crack damage and verify the method's feasibility and effectiveness. Our proposed method provides a fast and reliable way to evaluate cracks in buildings, which has a high potential for practical application.",
          "In recent years, as number of new building getting larger, there has been an increased interest in the cleaning of exterior walls. Accordingly, there is a growing interest in automatic cleaning robots that move around the outer building facade. These robots are also required to apply different cleaning methods to remove various contaminants on the outer wall of the building. However, current surface contaminant detection systems can either detect only a single type of contaminant, or are not compact enough for installation on mobile platforms that move around the outer facade. As cleaning workers are able to distinguish various contaminants with the naked eye, we aim to solve this problem by developing a machine-vision system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image processing methods. As it is a compact system that uses only a camera to take pictures and a processor to process the images, it is suitable for applications involving mobile platforms. Object-type contaminants such as avian feces are handled by the YOLOv3 module using the object-detection algorithm. Area-type contaminants such as rusty stains are processed using the color-detection module using the HSV color space, median filter, and flood fill algorithm. Particle-type contaminants such as dust are handled by the grayscale module, converting images to grayscale images and then comparing the average brightness with a reference that is provided in advance. This proposed machine vision system will detect objects, areas, and particle-type contaminants with a single image and some reference images provided in advance.",
          "Timely assessment of damages induced to buildings due to an earthquake is critical for ensuring life safety, mitigating financial losses, and expediting the rehabilitation process as well as enhancing the structural resilience where resilience is measured by an infrastructure's capacity to restore full functionality post extreme events. Since manual inspection is expensive, time consuming and risky, low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles or robots can be leveraged as a viable alternative for quick reconnaissance. Visual data captured by the sensors mounted on the robots can be analyzed, and the damages can be detected and classified autonomously. The present study proposes the use of deep learning-based approaches to this end. Region-based convolutional neural network (Faster RCNN) is exploited to detect four different damage types, namely, surface crack, spalling (which includes facade spalling and concrete spalling), and severe damage with exposed rebars and severely buckled rebars. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on manually annotated image data collected from reinforced concrete buildings damaged under several past earthquakes such as Nepal (2015), Taiwan (2016), Ecuador (2016), Erzincan (1992), Duzce (1999), Bingol (2003), Peru (2007), Wenchuan (2008), and Haiti (2010). Several experiments are presented in the paper to illustrate the capabilities, as well as the limitations, of the proposed approach for earthquake reconnaissance. It was observed that Inception-ResNet-v2 significantly outperforms the other networks considered in this study. The research outcome is a stepping stone forward to facilitate the autonomous assessment of buildings where this can be potentially useful for insurance companies, government agencies, and property owners.",
          "In the last decade, the documentation of historical buildings has made tremendous progress in generalising the use of high-precision laser scanning and drone photogrammetry. Yet the potential of digital surveying is not fully exploited due to difficulties in manually analysing large amounts of collected data. Machine learning offers immense potential as a game-changer in building archaeology, especially for the documentation of structures composed of millions of units. This paper presents the first segmentation of large-scale surveys of historic masonry using machine learning, using the thirteenth-century Basilica of St Anthony (Padua, Italy) as a case study. Based on a drone survey of the north facade of the building (110 x 70 m), a state-of-the-art non-learning segmentation approach is described and its limitations for historical structures are illustrated. Then, a new workflow based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) is presented. The result is a precise mapping of about 300,000 individual bricks showing a large variety of formats and bonds. The automatic surveys are analysed using visual programming language (VPL), enabling a rapid and feature-based identification of building phases and repair interventions. The outcome demonstrates the validity of machine learning for the analysis of historical structures and its potential in the field of heritage.",
          "This paper proposes an automated approach to predict crack pattern similarities that correlate well with assessment by structural engineers. We use Siamese convolutional neural networks (SCNN) that take two crack pattern images as inputs and output scalar similarity measures. We focus on 2D masonry facades with and without openings. The image pairs are generated using a statistics-based approach and labelled by 28 structural engineering experts. When the data is randomly split into fit and test data, the SCNNs can achieve good performance on the test data (R-2 approximate to 0.9). When the SCNNs are tested on unseen archetypes, their test R-2 values are on average 1% lower than the case where all archetypes are seen during the training. These very good results indicate that SCNNs can generalise to unseen cases without compromising their performance. Although the analyses are restricted to the considered synthetic images, the results are promising and the approach is general.",
          "This paper describes a knowledge-based system for the non-destructive diagnostics of facade isolation. The system uses the fusion of information extracted from images obtained from two electromagnetic wavebands: from low-resolution IR images (320 x 240 pixels: 7.5-13 mu m wavelength), and from high-resolution visual RGB images (3264 x 2448 pixels; 0.39-0.75 mu m wavelength). The fusion of the information is a perquisite for the design of an efficient knowledge-based system for non-destructive testing and facade diagnostics. In the paper, special attention is devoted to the following knowledge-based system components: system-core components (the database, the knowledge base, the inference engine, and the user interface) and application-specific components (image acquisition, the resolution pyramid, image pre-processing and feature extraction, image registration, object segmentation, fusion, and data analysis). Examples of the non-destructive testing and the facade diagnostics obtained with the system are presented. ",
          "Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are frequently used for periodic visual inspection of building envelopes to detect unsafe conditions or vulnerable damages. Inspection practitioners have to manually examine the large amounts of high-resolution images collected by UAVs to identify anomalies or damages on building facades for reporting and repairs. The computer vision and deep learning technologies have emerged as promising solutions to automate the image-based inspection process. However, for the detection of facade cracks from UAV-captured images, existing deep learning solutions may not perform well due to the complicated background noises caused by different facade components and materials. Towards that end, this paper proposed a two-step deep learning method for the automated detection of facade cracks from UAV-captured images. In the first step, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model was designed and trained on 26,177 images to classify images in a patch-level size of 128 x 128 pixels into crack or non-crack. In the second step, a U-Net neural network model was trained on 2870 image sets to segment crack pixels within those patches classified as cracks. Experimental results show a high performance of 94% and 96% precision, 94% and 95% recall, and 94% and 96% F1-scores was achieved by the CNN model and the U-Net model respectively. The experimental results proved that the twostep method can improve the reliability and efficiency of detecting and differentiating facade cracks from complicated facade noises. The proposed method can also be extended to detect other types of facade anomalies (e.g., corrosion and joint failures), thus facilitating a comprehensive assessment of facade conditions for better decision-making for the maintenance of building facades during its service life.",
          "As the number of high-rise buildings is increasing, more methods of exterior-wall cleaning are being developed. There are a few models based on artificial intelligence that determine the type and level of contamination primarily by moving the cleaning area. In this study, we propose an system using YOLOv3 algorithm, color-detection, to install on facade cleaning robot and brightness-discrimination. There are three types of contaminant-detection parameters: size, color, and brightness, and these parameters are subjected to a robust optimization process to maintain a constant detection rate under different conditions. The three parameters are determined via Taguchi method with signal to noise ratio and noise factors. An environment for algorithm testing is established, and artificial contamination is implemented on the specimen. A field test with the detection algorithm shall be performed in the near future."

While this problem is well-studied in the literature, most of the existing studies are either qualitative or minimally driven quantitative studies that rely on localized building envelope points and are, thus, not suitable for automated solutions in energy audit applications. This research work is an attempt to fill this gap of knowledge by utilizing intensive thermal data (on the order of 100,000 plus images) and constitutes a relatively new area of analysis in energy audit applications. Specifically, we demonstrate a novel process using deep-learning methods to segment more than 100,000 thermal images collected from an unmanned aerial system (UAS). To quantify the heat loss for a building envelope, multiple stages of computations need to be performed: object detection (using Mask-RCNN\\u002fFaster R-CNN), estimating the surface temperature (using two clustering methods), and finally calculating the overall heat transfer coefficient (e.g., the U-value). The proposed model was applied to eleven academic campuses across the state of North Dakota. The preliminary findings indicate that Mask R-CNN outperformed other instance segmentation models with an mIOU of 73% for facades, 55% for windows, 67% for roofs, 24% for doors, and 11% for HVACs. Two clustering methods, namely K-means and threshold-based clustering (TBC), were deployed to estimate surface temperatures with TBC providing consistent estimates across all times of the day over K-means. Our analysis demonstrated that thermal efficiency not only depended on the accurate acquisition of thermal images but also relied on other factors, such as the building geometry and seasonal weather parameters, such as the outside\\u002finside building temperatures, wind, time of day, and indoor heating\\u002fcooling conditions. Finally, the resultant U-values of various building envelopes were compared with recommendations from the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) building standards.\",\"Deep Learning methods have important applications in the building construction image classification field. One challenge of this application is Convolutional Neural Networks adoption in a small datasets. This paper proposes a rigorous methodology for tuning of Data Augmentation hyperparameters in Deep Learning to building construction image classification, especially to vegetation recognition in facades and roofs structure analysis. In order to do that, Logistic Regression models were used to analyze the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks trained from 128 combinations of transformations in the images. Experiments were carried out with three architectures of Deep Learning from the literature using the Keras library. The results show that the recommended configuration (Height Shift Range = 0.2; Width Shift Range = 0.2; Zoom Range =0.2) reached an accuracy of 95.6% in the test step of first case study. In addition, the hyperparameters recommended by proposed method also achieved the best test results for second case study: 93.3%.\",\"Building facade colors play an important role in influencing urban imageability, attraction and citizens' experience. However, the relations between street functions and the building facade color distribution, color harmony and color diversity have not been thoroughly examined. We obtained the dominant colors of building facades in Changning District, Shanghai, utilizing Baidu street view images, image semantic segmentation technology and the K-means algorithm. The variations in building facades' dominant colors, color harmony and diversity across different types of functional streets were examined through logistic regression and ANOVA analyses. The results indicate that, compared to industrial streets, red hues are more common in science education streets, residential streets and mixed functional streets. Business streets are more likely to have hues of green, red and red-purple. Residential streets' saturation is overall higher than that of industrial streets. In business streets, the medium-high value occurs less frequently than other streets. Moreover, we found that the street building facade colors in industrial streets were more harmonious and less diversified than that in other functional streets. This study has implications for urban color planning practices. Color harmony and color diversity should be well considered in future planning. The role of street functions should also be addressed in building facade color planning, to improve existing planning frameworks as well as related strategies.\",\"Building performance significantly influences energy use and indoor thermal conditions tied to the quality of living for its occupants. Therefore, information on building envelopes is essential, especially considering that envelopes and windows can impact 50% of energy loads in the United States. However, current retrofits supporting Building Energy Modelling (BEM) tools face multiple barriers, including time consumption and labor intensity due to manual modeling and calibration processes. This paper proposes using Deep Learning (DL) -based object detection algorithms to detect building envelope components, more specificlly doors, and windows, that can be applied to building energy performance analysis, 3D modeling, and assessment of thermal irregularities. We compare four different versions of the state-of-the-art YOLO V5 model to identify which version best suits the goal of detecting these building components. Results show that YOLO V5_X provides the best performance for detection accuracy.\",\"Urban environments are regions of complex and diverse architecture. Their reconstruction and representation as three-dimensional city models have attracted the attention of many researchers and industry specialists, as they increasingly recognise the potential for new applications requiring detailed building models. Nevertheless, despite being investigated for a few decades, the comprehensive reconstruction of buildings remains a challenging task. While there is a considerable body of literature on this topic, including several systematic reviews summarising ways of acquiring and reconstructing coarse building structures, there is a paucity of in-depth research on the detection and reconstruction of facade openings (i.e., windows and doors). In this review, we provide an overview of emerging applications, data acquisition and processing techniques for building facade reconstruction, emphasising building opening detection. The use of traditional technologies from terrestrial and aerial platforms, along with emerging approaches, such as mobile phones and volunteered geography information, is discussed. The current status of approaches for opening detection is then examined in detail, separated into methods for three-dimensional and two-dimensional data. Based on the review, it is clear that a key limitation associated with facade reconstruction is process automation and the need for user intervention. Another limitation is the incompleteness of the data due to occlusion, which can be reduced by data fusion. In addition, the lack of available diverse benchmark datasets and further investigation into deep-learning methods for facade openings extraction present crucial opportunities for future research.\",\"Deep Learning methods have important applications in digital image processing. However, the literature lacks further studies that propose machine learning models to images classification in civil construction area. For example, the vegetation recognition on facades can be relevant in identifying the degradation and abandonment of buildings. Thus, the objective of this paper is to propose an Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) approach to vegetation images recognition in buildings. For this, a database with urban images (low altitude) captured by a drone in Zurich (Switzerland) was adopted. In addition, a rigorous hyperparameters tuning methodology for the CNN model is presented. After adjusting the hyperparameters and the final model, the system achieved 90% of accuracy in the test stage. It should also be noted that CNN correctly classified 97.8% of the positive class (with vegetation on the facade) in test images.\",\"This paper presents an automated as-is facade modeling method for existing and historic high-rise buildings, named Scan4Facade. To begin with, a camera drone with a spiral path is employed to capture building exterior images, and photogrammetry is used to conduct three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and create mesh models for the scanned building facades. High-resolution facade orthoimages are then generated from mesh models and pixelwise segmented by an artificial intelligence (AI) model named U-net. A combined data augmentation strategy, including random flipping, rotation, resizing, perspective transformation, and color adjustment, is proposed for model training with a limited number of labels. As a result, the U-net achieves an average pixel accuracy of 0.9696 and a mean intersection over union of 0.9063 in testing. Then, the developed twoStagesClustering algorithm, with a two-round shape clustering and a two-round coordinates clustering, is used to precisely extract facade elements' dimensions and coordinates from facade orthoimages and pixelwise label. In testing with the Michigan Central Station (office tower), a historic high-rise building, the developed algorithm achieves an accuracy of 99.77% in window extraction. In addition, the extracted facade geometric information and element types are transformed into AutoCAD command and script files to create CAD drawings without manual interaction. Experimental results also show that the proposed Scan4Facade method can provide clear and accurate information to assist BIM feature creation in Revit. Future research recommendations are also stated in this paper. \",\"The extraction and integration of building facade data are necessary for the development of information infrastructure for urban environments. However, existing methods for parsing building facades based on semantic segmentation have difficulties in distinguishing individual instances of connected buildings. Manually collecting and annotating instances of building facades in large datasets is time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the recent development and use of city digital twins (CDTs), massive high-quality digital assets of buildings have been created. These assets make it possible to generate high-quality and cost-effective synthetic datasets that can replace real-world ones as training sets for the supervised learning-based instance segmentation of building facades. In this study, we developed a novel framework that can automatically produce synthetic datasets from a CDT. An auto-generation system for synthetic street views was built by rendering city digital assets in a game engine, while the system auto-generated the instance annotations for building facades. The hybrid dataset HSRBFIA, along with various subsets containing different proportions of synthetic and real data, were used to train deep learning models for facade instance segmentation. In our experiments, two types of synthetic data (CDT-based and virtual-based) were compared, and the results showed that the CDT synthetic data were more effective in boosting deep learning training with real-world images compared with the virtual synthetic data (no real-world counterparts). By swapping a certain portion of the real data with the proposed CDT synthetic images, the performance could almost match what is achievable when using the real-world training set.\",\"Deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks have largely improved the performance of building segmentation from remote sensing images. However, the images for building segmentation are often in the form of traditional orthophotos, where the relief displacement would cause non-negligible misalignment between the roof outline and the footprint of a building; such misalignment poses considerable challenges for extracting accurate building footprints, especially for high-rise buildings. Aiming at alleviating this problem, a new workflow is proposed for generating rectified building footprints from traditional orthophotos. We first use the facade labels, which are prepared efficiently at low cost, along with the roof labels to train a semantic segmentation network. Then, the well-trained network, which employs the state-of-the-art version of EfficientNet as backbone, extracts the roof segments and the facade segments of buildings from the input image. Finally, after clustering the classified pixels into instance-level building objects and tracing out the roof outlines, an energy function is proposed to drive the roof outline to maximally align with the building footprint; thus, the rectified footprints can be generated. The experiments on the aerial orthophotos covering a high-density residential area in Shanghai demonstrate that the proposed workflow can generate obviously more accurate building footprints than the baseline methods, especially for high-rise buildings.\",\"Precise urban facade color is the foundation of urban color planning. Nevertheless, existing research on urban colors usually relies on manual sampling due to technical limitations, which brings challenges for evaluating urban facade color with the co-existence of city-scale and fine-grained resolution. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based approach for mapping the urban facade color using street-view imagery. The dominant color of the urban facade (DCUF) is adopted as an indicator to describe the urban facade color. A case study in Shenzhen was conducted to measure the urban facade color using Baidu Street View (BSV) panoramas, with city-scale mapping of the urban facade color in both irregular geographical units and regular grids. Shenzhen's urban facade color has a gray tone with low chroma. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has a high level of accuracy for the extraction of the urban facade color. In short, this study contributes to the development of urban color planning by efficiently analyzing the urban facade color with higher levels of validity across city-scale areas. Insights into the mapping of the urban facade color from the humanistic perspective could facilitate higher quality urban space planning and design.\",\"The objective of this paper is to propose an approach which combines the multi view 3D reconstruction process of a building's facade with semantic information obtained by a deep neural network on the 2D observations of the considered scene. The object detector was used to annotate precise 2D features with semantic labels based on the object proposals. In a next step, spatially connected 2D features were evaluated to extend the initially computed labels to the whole facade element. The set of annotated 2D precise features was used to derive a classification of reconstructed 3D features. The a priori probabilities of the object detection model were used to compensate for biased predictions. The described approach was evaluated thoroughly with a view to different strategies for the annotation correction in 2D. Several failure patterns occurring in the considered application of facade reconstruction were observed and suggested solutions were given.\",\"Automatic building categorization and analysis are particularly relevant for smart city applications and cultural heritage programs. Taking a picture of the facade of a building and instantly obtaining information about it can enable the automation of processes in urban planning, virtual city tours, and digital archiving of cultural artifacts. In this paper, we go beyond traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and propose the HierarchyNet: a new hierarchical network for the classification of urban buildings from all across the globe into different main and subcategories from images of their facades. We introduce a coarse-to-fine hierarchy on the dataset and the model learns to simultaneously extract features and classify across both levels of hierarchy. We propose a new multiplicative layer, which is able to improve the accuracy of the finer prediction by considering the feedback signal of the coarse layers. We have quantitatively evaluated the proposed approach both on our proposed building datasets, as well as on various benchmark databases to demonstrate that the model is able to efficiently learn hierarchical information. The HierarchyNet model is able to outperform the state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks in urban building classification as well as in other multi-label classification tasks while using significantly fewer parameters.\",\"Three-dimensional (3D) city modeling is an essential component of 3D geoscience modeling, and window detection of building facades plays a crucial role in 3D city modeling. Windows can serve as structural priors for rapid building reconstruction. In this article, we propose a framework for detecting window lines. The framework consists of two parts: an improved stacked hourglass network and a point-line extraction module. This framework can output vectorized window wireframes from building facade images. Besides, our method is end-to-end trainable, and the vectorized window wireframe consists of point-line structures. The point-line structure contains both semantic and geometric information. Additionally, we propose a new dataset of real-world building facades for window-line detection. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method has superior efficiency, accuracy, and applicability in window-line detection compared to existing line detection algorithms. Moreover, our proposed method presents a new idea for deep learning methods in window detection and other application scenarios in current 3D geoscience modeling.\",\"Energy audit in buildings is an essential task for optimal energy management and operations. This paper focuses on a machine learning pipeline to quantify heat loss using 60,000 thermal images in buildings. The images are captured from a small Unmanned Aerial System (sUAS) over the last two years to form a large thermal data repository. Intense efforts are made to annotate multiple sections of the buildings (e.g. windows, doors, ground, facade, trees, and sky). Data augmentation processes are then applied to generate a large comprehensive training data set. Object detection and instance segmentation models such as Mask R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, and Faster R-CNN were trained, and tested. The preliminary results indicate that Mask R-CNN has a larger mean average precision (mAP) of (83%) over R-CNN (51%), Fast R-CNN (62%), and Faster R-CNN (62 %) for a threshold of 50%. The surface temperature values from these thermal images (pixel-by-pixel) were then used in the standard heat transfer coefficient (U-value in BTU\\u002fhr\\u002fSq.ft.\\u002fF) calculations.\",\"Measuring window to wall ratios (WWRs) is key to assessing building performance as facade apertures control the admission of light, wind and heat. However, this data is not always publicly available. This paper details a methodology for automatically extracting and rectifying street-view facade imagery while utilizing a Machine Learning model to detect WWRs with architectural generalization in mind. Although several models of detection have emerged to categorize facade features, some lack robustness when presented with greater design diversity. Hence, the training and validation process of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model utilized is centered around three main data categories; environmental conditions, design diversity and context. The results show that the proposed workflow sufficiently represents the WWRs of buildings in an area in Lisbon under varied design conditions. We find that the distribution of prediction accuracy, tested on 864 facades, shows that 72% of buildings are detected within the 10% error range.\",\"With buildings consuming nearly 40% of energy in developed countries, it is important to accurately estimate and understand the building energy efficiency in a city. A better understanding of building energy efficiency is beneficial for reducing overall household energy use and providing guidance for future housing improvement and retrofit. In this research, we propose a deep learning-based multi-source data fusion framework to estimate building energy efficiency. We consider the traditional factors associated with the building energy efficiency from the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for 160,000 properties (30,000 buildings) in Glasgow, UK (e.g., property structural attributes and morphological attributes), as well as the Google Street View (GSV) building facade images as a complement. We compare the performance improvements between our data-fusion framework with traditional morphological attributes and image-only models. The results show that including the building facade images from GSV, the overall model accuracy increases from 79.7% to 86.8%. A further investigation and explanation of the deep learning model are conducted to understand the relationships between building features and building energy efficiency by using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Our research demonstrates the potential of using multi-source data in building energy efficiency prediction with high accuracy and short inference time. Our paper also helps understand building energy efficiency at the city level to help achieve the netzero target by 2050.\",\"Precise measuring of urban facade color is necessary for urban color planning. The existing manual methods of measuring building facade color are limited by time and labor costs and hardly carried out on a city scale. These methods also make it challenging to identify the role of the building function in controlling and guiding urban color planning. This paper explores a city-scale approach to facade color measurement with building functional classification using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and street view images. Firstly, we used semantic segmentation to extract building facades and conducted the color calibration of the photos for pre-processing the collected street view images. Then, we proposed a color chart-based facade color measurement method and a multi-label deep learning-based building classification method. Next, the field survey data were used as the ground truth to verify the accuracy of the facade color measurement and building function classification. Finally, we applied our approach to generate facade color distribution maps with the building classification for three metropolises in China, and the results proved the transferability and effectiveness of the scheme. The proposed approach can provide city managers with an overall perception of urban facade color and building function across city-scale areas in a cost-efficient way, contributing to data-driven decision making for urban analytics and planning.\",\"Buildings account for 40% of the energy consumption and more than 50% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions worldwide. Various building energy efficiency policies have been issued in many cities around the US, requiring the disclosure of buildings' energy performance and encourage building owners to take this information into consideration for retrofit investment decisions. However, various types of building information at different scales are meant to be collected and disclosed with costs that have substantial variations accordingly. Hence, complying with these policies is expensive and time-consuming for both government agencies and building owners. This paper proposes a non-intrusive and scalable data-driven approach to automatically capture energy-critical building characteristics to declare energy benchmarking or retrofitting policies. This approach first integrated open city data sets (building-related) and identified principal building variables in relation to energy performance indexes (i.e., electricity usage), then utilized transfer learning to retrain deep learning models on building facade images (retrieved from Google Street View) to extract their corresponding principal building variables. To elaborate, given a fully captured facade image of any building, this approach provides the data values for the identified principal variables (e.g., for a facade image given as an input, the outputs will include buildingType = Office). The best accuracy of the extraction model exceeds 80% in extracting building types from images, which indicates that the model is capable of extracting data values for the principal building variables that are essential for energy performance of buildings.\",\"Thermography technology is widely used to inspect thermal anomalies in building facade systems. Computer vision-based techniques provide opportunities to autonomously detect such heat anomalies to significantly improve the efficiency of decision-making for building envelope retrofitting and maintenance. In this work, we propose a novel Capsule Network-based deep learning model - CapsLab - that detects and identifies thermal anomalies by semantic segmentation. CapsLab is built based on our proposed prediction-tuning capsule (PT-Capsule) layer. Different from a traditional capsule layer, which consists of part-whole transformation and capsule-routing process, the proposed layer is composed of a prediction and tuning process, which helps decreasing the number of model parameters significantly. While the applicability of traditional Capsule Networks (CapsNets) has been limited to simpler tasks and smaller datasets due to their scalability issue, we can leverage the lightweight of the proposed PT-Capsule layer, and apply it to the semantic segmentation task. In this work, we also employ our previously presented performance metric, referred to as the Anomaly Identification Metric (AIM) (Kakillioglua et al. 2021), to evaluate the segmentation outputs. Traditional performance metrics do not accurately reflect the true performance of the segmentation models in thermal anomaly identification due to the high subjectivity in the annotation process and higher overlap ratio sensitivity of the standard metrics. AIM, on the other hand, is robust to these drawbacks. Experimental results show, both qualitatively and quantitatively, that our proposed segmentation method can effectively segment the thermal anomalies. Specifically, our model provides 9.38% and 13.53% improvements over the baseline model - DeepLabV3+ - based on traditional mIoU score and the AIM score, respectively, while requiring less model parameters and less computation at the same time. In addition, the scores that the AIM metric generates better align with the scores provided by building performance experts.\",\"Systems that rely on Face Recognition (FR) biometric have gained great importance ever since terrorist threats imposed weakness among the implemented security systems. Other biometrics i.e., fingerprints or iris recognition is not trustworthy in such situations whereas FR is considered as a fine compromise. This survey illustrates different FR practices that laid foundations on the issue of partial occlusion dilemma where faces are disguised to cheat the security system. Occlusion refers to facade of the face image which can be due to sunglasses, hair or wrapping of facial image by scarf or other accessories. Efforts on FR in controlled settings have been in the picture for past several years; however identification under uncontrolled conditions like illumination, expression and partial occlusion is quite a matter of concern. Based on literature a classification is made in this paper to solve the recognition of face in the presence of partial occlusion. These methods are named as part based methods that make use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), Local Non-negative Matrix Factorization (LNMF), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and other variations. Feature based and fractal based methods consider features around eyes, nose or mouth region to be used in the recognition phase of algorithms. Furthermore the paper details the experiments and databases used by an assortment of authors to handle the problem of occlusion and the results obtained after performing diverse set of analysis. Lastly, a comparison of various techniques is shown in tabular format to give a precise overview of what different authors have already projected in this particular field.\",\"3D city models are often generated from oblique aerial images and photogrammetric point clouds. In contrast to roof surfaces, facades can not directly be reconstructed in a similar high level of quality from this data. Distortions of perspective might appear in images, due to the camera angle. Occlusions and shadowing occur as well. Objects, such as windows and doors, will have to be detected on such data if facades are to be reconstructed. Although one can use inpainting techniques to cover occluded areas, detection results are often incomplete and noisy. Formal grammars can then be used to align and add objects. However, it is difficult to find suitable rules for all types of buildings. We propose a post-processing approach based on neural networks to improve facade layouts. To this end, we applied existing Recurrent Neural Network architectures like Multi-Dimensional Long Short-term Memory Network and Quasi Recurrent Neural Network in a new context. We also propose a novel architecture, the Rotated Multi-Dimensional Long Short Term Memory. In order to deal with two-dimensional neighborhoods this architecture combines four two-dimensional Multi-Dimensional Long Short-term Memory Networks on rotated images. We could improve the quality of detection results on the Graz50 data set.\",\"Building color and harmoniousness have been regarded as critical issues in planning historic districts. Harmoniousness of building facade colors (HBFC) is an indicator to evaluate the quality of the built environment, which can be perceived but is difficult to measure quantitatively. In addition, alleviating the impact of shadows in street-view images (SVIs) to assess building facade color is another research gap that is difficult to address. This paper proposes an efficient approach for evaluating HBFC on a large-scale using SVIs and a deep learning algorithm. Specifically, a shadow processing method was developed, and transfer learning was integrated into the harmoniousness evaluation process. The historical district of Guangzhou, China, was selected as a case study area. This study contributes to the development of human-centered planning and design by providing continuous measurements of unmeasurable quality across large-scale areas. Meanwhile, insights into building facade color and its harmoniousness can assist with accurate design guidance, which is important for historic districts.\",null],\"marker\":{\"color\":\"#CFD8DC\",\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"other\",\"showlegend\":false,\"x\":[6.5391669273376465,9.16259479522705,8.291644096374512,6.5004472732543945,10.109001159667969,9.1516752243042,9.94538688659668,9.651229858398438,9.603034973144531,8.25475788116455,9.756942749023438,9.501179695129395,10.128673553466797,6.605602264404297,9.222408294677734,6.157109260559082,8.311779022216797,6.1567206382751465,6.7989420890808105,10.930676460266113,9.820117950439453,8.288005828857422,8.585777282714844],\"y\":[3.26065731048584,2.6592917442321777,0.9460276365280151,3.081514596939087,0.9566842317581177,2.6734588146209717,2.180631160736084,0.5458206534385681,1.348544716835022,0.9061821699142456,0.6840232014656067,1.1385443210601807,0.6339277625083923,3.278524160385132,1.094958782196045,2.601297378540039,0.937286376953125,2.5797903537750244,3.3247809410095215,1.0370659828186035,0.3681947588920593,0.8921581506729126,1.687698483467102],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"3D buildings in LoD3 (with facade objects) with semantic information are of great importance for many applications. In this paper, an interactive approach is proposed for 3D building models in LoD3 by using VGI image data. Similar to JSOM, an interactive platform is developed to acquire a facade model with detailed geometries and semantics. Techniques of feature extraction are incorporated in the software, so that a facade can be modeled by only sketching the boundary of the facade and one or two facade objects from one VGI image. The feedbacks of the current Beta version depict that the software is user friendly and can generate 3D facade while labelling facade objects by very few interactive input.\",\"Color information is a useful attribute to include in a building's description to assist the listener in identifying the intended target. Often this information is only available as image data, and not readily accessible for use in constructing referring expressions for verbal communication. The method presented uses a GIS building polygon layer in conjunction with street-level captured imagery to provide a method to automatically filter foreground objects and select pixels which correspond to building facades. These selected pixels are then used to define the most appropriate color term for the building, and corresponding fuzzy color term histogram. The technique uses a single camera capturing images at a high frame rate, with the baseline distance between frames calculated from a GPS speed log. The expected distance from the camera to the building is measured from the polygon layer and refined from the calculated depth map, after which building pixels are selected. In addition significant foreground planar surfaces between the known road edge and building facade are identified as possible boundary walls and hedges. The output is a dataset of the most appropriate color terms for both the building and boundary walls. Initial trials demonstrate the usefulness of the technique in automatically capturing color terms for buildings in urban regions.\",\"Developments in the field of artificial intelligence have made great strides in the field of automatic semantic segmentation, both in the 2D (image) and 3D spaces. Within the context of 3D recording technology it has also seen application in several areas, most notably in creating semantically rich point clouds which is usually performed manually. In this paper, we propose the introduction of deep learning-based semantic image segmentation into the photogrammetric 3D reconstruction and classification workflow. The main objective is to be able to introduce semantic classification at the beginning of the classical photogrammetric workflow in order to automatically create classified dense point clouds by the end of the said workflow. In this regard, automatic image masking depending on pre-determined classes were performed using a previously trained neural network. The image masks were then employed during dense image matching in order to constraint the process into the respective classes, thus automatically creating semantically classified point clouds as the final output. Results show that the developed method is promising, with automation of the whole process feasible from input (images) to output (labelled point clouds). Quantitative assessment gave good results for specific classes e.g., building facades and windows, with IoU scores of 0.79 and 0.77 respectively.\",\"We describe a real-time facade tracking system that uses, as setup information, only two images of a facade, captured on the moment. No more previous information is needed, such as a facade 3D model, dimensions or aspect ratio. Feature points and their local descriptors are extracted from that pair of images and used during the detection and tracking of the facade. Additionally, parallax and topological information is also used in order to increase the overall robustness of the tracking process. Experiments show that the system can detect and track a wide variety of facades, including those that are not entirely planar, partially occluded or have few distinguishable visual landmarks. The reliance on on-the-spot information, alone, makes this system useful for Outdoor Augmented Reality applications, in an Anywhere Augmentation urban context.\",\"The lack of data on existing buildings hinders efforts towards repair, reuse, and recycling of materials, which are crucial for mitigating the climate crisis. Manual acquisition of building data is complex and timeconsuming, but combining street-level imagery with computer vision could significantly scale-up building materials documentation. We formulate the problem of building facade material detection as a multi-label classification task and present a method using GIS and street view imagery with just a few hundred annotated samples and a fine-tuned image classification model. Our method shows strong performance with macroaveraged F1 scores of 0.91 for Tokyo, 0.91 for NYC, 0.96 for Zurich, and 0.93 for the merged dataset. By utilizing open-access and non-proprietary data, our method can be scaled-up step by step to a global level. We make our in the wild dataset publicly available as the Urban Resource Cadastre Repository to encourage future work on automatic building material detection.\",\"With increasing urbanization, flooding is a major challenge for many cities today. Based on forecast precipitation, topography, and pipe networks, flood simulations can provide early warnings for areas and buildings at risk of flooding. Basement windows, doors, and underground garage entrances are common places where floodwater can flow into a building. Some buildings have been prepared or designed considering the threat of flooding, but others have not. Therefore, knowing the heights of these facade openings helps to identify places that are more susceptible to water ingress. However, such data is not yet readily available in most cities. Traditional surveying of the desired targets may be used, but this is a very time-consuming and laborious process. Instead, mobile mapping using LiDAR (light detection and ranging) is an efficient tool to obtain a large amount of high-density 3D measurement data. To use this method, it is required to extract the desired facade openings from the data in a fully automatic manner. This research presents a new process for the extraction of windows and doors from LiDAR mobile mapping data. Deep learning object detection models are trained to identify these objects. Usually, this requires to provide large amounts of manual annotations. In this paper, we mitigate this problem by leveraging a rule-based method. In a first step, the rule-based method is used to generate pseudo-labels. A semi-supervised learning strategy is then applied with three different levels of supervision. The results show that using only automatically generated pseudo-labels, the learning-based model outperforms the rule-based approach by 14.6% in terms of F1-score. After five hours of human supervision, it is possible to improve the model by another 6.2%. By comparing the detected facade openings' heights with the predicted water levels from a flood simulation model, a map can be produced which assigns per-building flood risk levels. Thus, our research provides a new geographic information layer for fine-grained urban emergency response. This information can be combined with flood forecasting to provide a more targeted disaster prevention guide for the city's infrastructure and residential buildings. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to achieve such a large scale, fine-grained building flood risk mapping.\",\"The acquisition of detailed information for buildings and their components becomes more and more important. However, an automatic reconstruction needs high-resolution measurements. Such features can be derived from images or 3D laserscans that are e.g. taken by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Since this data is not always available or not measurable at the first for example due to occlusions we developed a reasoning approach that is based on sparse observations. It benefits from an extensive prior knowledge of probability density distributions and functional dependencies and allows for the incorporation of further structural characteristics such as symmetries. Bayesian networks are used to determine posterior beliefs. Stochastic reasoning is complex since the problem is characterized by a mixture of discrete and continuous parameters that are in turn correlated by nonlinear constraints. To cope with this kind of complexity, the implemented reasoner combines statistical methods with constraint propagation. It generates a limited number of hypotheses in a model-based top-down approach. It predicts substructures in building facades - such as windows - that can be used for specific UAV navigations for further measurements.\",\"We propose a novel three-layered approach for semantic segmentation of building facades. In the first layer, starting from an oversegmentation of a facade, we employ the recently introduced machine learning technique Recursive Neural Networks (RNN) to obtain a probabilistic interpretation of each segment. In the second layer, initial labeling is augmented with the information coming from specialized facade component detectors. The information is merged using a Markov Random Field. In the third layer, we introduce weak architectural knowledge, which enforces the final reconstruction to be architecturally plausible and consistent. Rigorous tests performed on two existing datasets of building facades demonstrate that we significantly outperform the current-state of the art, even when using outputs from earlier layers of the pipeline. Also, we show how the final output of the third layer can be used to create a procedural reconstruction.\",\"Facade structural features can represent the overall framework of buildings. However, structural features extracted by the current methods contain a quantity of trivial unstructured information. In this study, we proposed an accurate extraction method for structural features of building facades through texture fusion. By performing texture fusion on building facade images, the interference of textural elements on structural feature extraction could be eliminated. After texture fusion, the line segment detector (LSD) algorithm is used to extract the structural features from the building facade images, and random sample consensus (RANSAC) is used to improve the continuity of structural features. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated by comparing results with the state-of-the-art methods, such as LSD, MLSD, CannyLines, and MCMLSD. Value setting of three important parameters is discussed in detail. The imagery facade features extracted through the proposed method provide valuable support for many fields, such as image feature registration and 3D reconstruction of building surfaces.\",\"This paper proposes a novel method for extracting facades structure from real-world pictures by using local geometric moment. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method has advantages of easy-to-implement, low computational cost, and robustness to noises, such as uneven illumination, shadow, and shade from other objects. Besides, our method is faster and has a lower space complexity, making it feasible for mobile devices and the situation where real-time data processing is required. Specifically, a facades structure modal is first proposed to support the use of our special noise reduction method, which is based on a self-adapt local threshold with Gaussian weighted average for image binarization processing and the feature of the facades structure. Next, we divide the picture of the building into many individual areas, each of which represents a door or a window in the picture. Subsequently we calculate the geometric moment and centroid for each individual area, for identifying those collinear ones based on the feature vectors, each of which is thereafter replaced with a line. Finally, we comprehensively analyze all the geometric moment and centroid to find out the facades structure of the building. We compare our result with other methods and especially report the result from the pictures taken in bad environmental conditions. Our system is designed for two application, i.e, the reconstruction of facades based on higher resolution ground-based on imagery, and the positional system based on recognize the urban building.\",\"Automatic semantic segmentation of images is becoming a very prominent research field with many promising and reliable solutions already available. Labelled images as input for the photogrammetric pipeline have enormous potential to improve the 3D reconstruction results. To support this argument, in this work we discuss the contribution of image semantic labelling towards image-based 3D reconstruction in photogrammetry. We experiment semantic information in various steps starting from feature matching to dense 3D reconstruction. Labelling in 2D is considered as an easier task in terms of data availability and algorithm maturity. However, since semantic labelling of all the images involved in the reconstruction may be a costly, laborious and time consuming task, we propose to use a deep learning architecture to automatically generate semantically segmented images. To this end, we have trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on historic building facade images that will be further enriched in the future. The first results of this study are promising, with an improved performance on the quality of the 3D reconstruction and the possibility to transfer the labelling results from 2D to 3D. [GRAPHICS] .\",\"Currently, data captured by Mobile Laser Scanners (MLS) is becoming a leading source for the modelling of building facade geometry. Automatic processing of MLS point clouds for feature extraction on building facades is a demanding work. Point cloud segmentation and recognition are the most important steps in this context. In this paper, a new approach for automatic and fast processing of MLS data for the detection of building patches while restricting to segment other features is introduced. After filtering of the point clouds, the building facade extraction takes place. An initial building point cluster detection and roughness based point separation within the cluster itself are the preliminary stages of this process. Thereafter points are segmented into planar patches based on the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) technique, as most facades are dominated by planar faces. An intelligent seed point selection method is introduced, and growing rules are applied in order to extract the most significant planar features which represent the building facades. Each segmented plane is afterwards processed to recognize the facade features. A rule based partitioning tree, constructed from the 2D geometric knowledge of building features is used for facade feature recognition. The approach has been tested with several urban data sets, and results demonstrate that the method can be applied in an efficient modelling process.\",\"Semantic layout-based image synthesizing, which has benefited from the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs), has received a substantial amount of attention recently. How to enhance the synthesis image equality while maintaining the stochasticity of the GAN remains a challenge. We propose a novel denoising framework to handle this problem. The generation of overlapping objects is another challenging task when synthesizing images from a semantic layout to a realistic RGB photograph. To overcome this deficiency, we include a one-hot semantic label map to force the generator to pay more attention to the generation of overlapping objects. Furthermore, we improve the loss function of the discriminator by considering the perturbed loss and cascade layer loss to guide the generation process. We applied our methods to the Cityscapes, photo-sketch, day-night, facades, and NYU datasets to demonstrate the image generation ability of our model.\",\"We address shape grammar parsing for facade segmentation using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Shape parsing entails simultaneously optimizing the geometry and the topology (e.g. number of floors) of the facade, so as to optimize the fit of the predicted shape with the responses of pixel-level 'terminal detectors'. We formulate this problem in terms of a Hierarchical Markov Decision Process, by employing a recursive binary split grammar. This allows us to use RL to efficiently find the optimal parse of a given facade in terms of our shape grammar. Building on the RL paradigm, we exploit state aggregation to speedup computation, and introduce image-driven exploration in RL to accelerate convergence. We achieve state-of-the-art results on facade parsing, with a significant speed-up compared to existing methods, and substantial robustness to initial conditions. We demonstrate that the method can also be applied to interactive segmentation, and to a broad variety of architectural styles.\",\"Scaffolds always act as disturbances when reconstructing the 3D scene of the construction site due to occlusions, similarities with buildings in color and height as well as their adjacent positions to wall surfaces. Since scaffolds are commonly utilized to assist the construction and maintenance of building structures, professionals can estimate the overall progress and temporal objects of construction projects by assessing the status or arrangement of the scaffolds. Its thin, repeating and complex structures also make it a valuable dataset for testing related algorithms and approaches for the reconstruction of 3D construction site scene. To this end, we present a data driven workflow for the detection and reconstruction of scaffolding components, including tubes, toeboards, and decks, given a photogrammetric point cloud. Our workflow consists of two parts: one part concerns the strategy based on projection and methods of grouping and slicing planar surfaces for detecting and extracting points of scaffolds from the construction site. The other part relates to the point feature derivation using a novel 3D local feature descriptor LSSHOT, designed for extracting features in the classification of points. Specifically, our workflow is implemented by five major steps, including preprocessing of the point cloud, division of building facades, classification of points, geometric modeling and refinement of results. To evaluate our proposed descriptor, a series of simulated experiments using synthetic datasets is conducted via shape matching tests. A real application is also carried out to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our workflow using the photogrammetric point cloud of a construction site. Results of simulated experiments reveal that our proposed descriptor outperforms the original SHOT descriptor in the simulated test, especially when dealing with point clouds having a large percentage of noise. Regarding the real application of reconstructing scaffolds, points of scaffolds are successfully detected, extracted, and reconstructed. For a facade having enough points, over 70% of the scaffolding elements are reconstructed. For the classification of points using LSSHOT descriptor and a random forest classifier, the accuracy of results for the points of two major scaffolding elements reaches more than 70% in our test examples.\",\"Point cloud classification plays an important role in a wide range of airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) applications, such as topographic mapping, forest monitoring, power line detection, and road detection. However, due to the sensor noise, high redundancy, incompleteness, and complexity of airborne LiDAR systems, point cloud classification is challenging. Traditional point cloud classification methods mostly focus on the development of handcrafted point geometry features and employ machine learning-based classification models to conduct point classification. In recent years, the advances of deep learning models have caused researchers to shift their focus towards machine learning-based models, specifically deep neural networks, to classify airborne LiDAR point clouds. These learning-based methods start by transforming the unstructured 3D point sets to regular 2D representations, such as collections of feature images, and then employ a 2D CNN for point classification. Moreover, these methods usually need to calculate additional local geometry features, such as planarity, sphericity and roughness, to make use of the local structural information in the original 3D space. Nonetheless, the 3D to 2D conversion results in information loss. In this paper, we propose a directionally constrained fully convolutional neural network (D-FCN) that can take the original 3D coordinates and LiDAR intensity as input; thus, it can directly apply to unstructured 3D point clouds for semantic labeling. Specifically, we first introduce a novel directionally constrained point convolution (D-Conv) module to extract locally representative features of 3D point sets from the projected 2D receptive fields. To make full use of the orientation information of neighborhood points, the proposed D-Conv module performs convolution in an orientation-aware manner by using a directionally constrained nearest neighborhood search. Then, we design a multiscale fully convolutional neural network with downsampling and upsampling blocks to enable multiscale point feature learning. The proposed D-FCN model can therefore process input point cloud with arbitrary sizes and directly predict the semantic labels for all the input points in an end-to-end manner. Without involving additional geometry features as input, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance on the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) 3D labeling benchmark dataset. The results show that our model achieves a new stateof-the-art performance on powerline, car, and facade categories. Moreover, to demonstrate the generalization abilities of the proposed method, we conduct further experiments on the 2019 Data Fusion Contest Dataset. Our proposed method achieves superior performance than the comparing methods and accomplishes an overall accuracy of 95.6% and an average F1 score of 0.810.\",\"Glass facade segmentation provides important semantic information for widespread application, such as light pollution assessment, energy conservation, emergency response, and so on. With the advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, aerial imagery is indispensable for urban environmental studies because it can quickly cover large-scale city areas that contain rich thematic information. However, various methods are elaborately designed for glass or transparent object detection in natural images but not for glass facades in oblique aerial images. In oblique aerial images, glass facade panels with salient boundaries are spatially related and have various sizes and appearances. For the glass facade segmentation task, we notice that semantic and instance segmentation methods have different strengths and failures. To get the best of both worlds, this letter presents an ensemble method to segment glass facades in oblique aerial images. A novel annotation strategy is adopted to preserve the spatial relationship between glass facade panels, and edge features are extracted to improve the detector's performance. Furthermore, we contribute a glass facade segmentation dataset (GFSD) to evaluate our method, which is a supplement to UAV image datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy effectively improves instance segmentation methods, and the ensemble method outperforms the single models with an F1 score of 95.48%.\",\"Effectively parsing the facade is essential to 3-D building reconstruction, which is a significant computer vision problem for digital entertainment. Although having achieved the promising results in semantic parsing, deep learning methods cannot directly make use of the architectural rules that play an important role in man-made structures. This article presents a novel translational symmetry-based approach. The unified facade parsing network integrates both segmentation and detection branches as the base parser. A translational symmetry measurement-based module is proposed to refine the initial results. After converting the facades into shape grammars, we employ an off-the-shelf rendering engine like Blender to reconstruct the high-quality 3-D models using procedural modeling. We conduct experiments on three public datasets, where our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\",\"In this paper we propose a geometry-based image retrieval scheme that makes use of projectively invariant features. Cross-ratio (CR) is an invariant feature under projective transformations for collinear points. We compute the CRs of point sets in quadruplets and the CR histogram is used as the feature for retrieval purposes. Being a geometric feature, it allows us to retrieve similar images irrespective of view point and illumination changes. We can retrieve the same building even if the facade has undergone a fresh coat of paints! Color and textural features can also be included, if desired. Experimental results show a favorably very good retrieval accuracy when tested on an image database of size 4000. The method is very effective in retrieving images having man-made objects rich in polygonal structures like buildings, rail tracks, etc. \",\"Texture is one of the most important features for object detection and recognition. In many applications, it is derived from the responses of texture filters. In this paper, we evaluate the potential of seven texture filter banks for the pixel-based classification of terrestrial facade images. Particularly, we analyze features from Gabor, Haar, Root Filter Set, and Walsh filters as well as filters that have been proposed by Laws (1980), Leung and Malik (2001), and Schmid (2001). We determine texture energies similar to the approach of Laws (1980) using the proposed filter banks, and then we classify the derived feature vectors by three different methods: maximum a posteriori probabilities (MAP), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and random forest (RF), respectively. In all three cases, we obtained best classification results with Haar, Laws, and Walsh filters.\",\"A longstanding line of research in urban studies explores how cities can be understood through their appearance. However, what remains unclear is to what extent urban dwellers' everyday life can be explained by the visual clues of the urban environment. In this paper, we address this question by applying a computer vision model to 27 million street view images across 80 counties in the United States. Then, we use the spatial distribution of notable urban features identified through the street view images, such as street furniture, sidewalks, building facades, and vegetation, to predict the socioeconomic profiles of their immediate neighborhood. Our results show that these urban features alone can account for up to 83% of the variance in people's travel behavior, 62% in poverty status, 64% in crime, and 68% in health behaviors. The results outperform models based on points of interest (POI), population, and other demographic data alone. Moreover, incorporating urban features captured from street view images can improve the explanatory power of these other methods by 5% to 25%. We propose urban visual intelligence as a process to uncover hidden city profiles, infer, and synthesize urban information with computer vision and street view images. This study serves as a foundation for future urban research interested in this process and understanding the role of visual aspects of the city.\",\"This paper addresses the topic of how architectural visual experience can be represented and utilised by a software system. The long-term aim is to equip an artificial agent with the ability to make sensible decisions about aesthetics and proportions. The focus of the investigation is on the feature of line distributions extracted from digital images of house facades. It is demonstrated how the dimensionality reduction method isomap can be applied to calculate non-linear street-manifolds where each point on the manifold corresponds to a house facade. Through interpolation between manifold points and the application of an inverse Hough transform, basic structure plans for new house facades are obtained. If the interpolated points are close to the manifold it can be argued that the new plans reflect the character of the surrounding streetscape. The method is also demonstrated using basic examples which can be represented by circles.\",\"Detection and vectorization of windows from building facades are important for building energy modeling, civil engineering, and architecture design. However, current applications still face the challenges of low accuracy and lack of automation. In this article we propose a new two-steps workflow for window segmentation and vectorization from facade images. First, we propose a cross field learning-based neural network architecture, which is augmented by a grid-based self-attention module for window segmentation from rectified facade images, resulting in pixel-wise window blobs. Second, we propose a regression neural network augmented by squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention blocks for window vectorization. The network takes the segmentation results together with the original facade image as input, and directly outputs the position of window corners, resulting in vectorized window objects with improved accuracy. In order to validate the effectiveness of our method, experiments are carried out on four public facades image datasets, with results usually yielding a higher accuracy for the final window prediction in comparison to baseline methods on four datasets in terms of intersection over union score, F1 score, and pixel accuracy.\",\"This paper presents a new approach for the prediction of substructures in building facades based on sparse observations. We automatically generate a small number of most likely hypotheses and provide probabilities for each of them. Probability density functions of model parameters which in most cases are non Gaussian and multimodal are learned from training data and approximated by Gaussian mixtures. Relations between model parameters are represented by non-linear constraints. For stochastic reasoning we design and apply a special kind of Bayesian networks which involves both discrete as well as continuous variables, a scenario which often suggests the use of approximate inference which however is infeasible in the face of a huge number of competing model hypotheses. In order to be able to scan huge model spaces avoiding the pitfalls of approximate reasoning and to exploit the potential of both observations and models, we combined Bayesian networks with constraint logic programs. We designed a method which breaks down the problem into a feasible number of subproblems for which exact inference can be applied. We illustrate our approach with building facades and demonstrate that particularly for buildings with strong symmetries number and position of windows can be deduced on the basis of ground plans alone.\",\"The ability to recognize the position and order of the floor-level lines that divide adjacent building floors can benefit many applications, for example, urban augmented reality (AR). This work tackles the problem of locating floor-level lines in street-view images, using a supervised deep learning approach. Unfortunately, very little data is available for training such a network - current street-view datasets contain either semantic annotations that lack geometric attributes, or rectified facades without perspective priors. To address this issue, we first compile a new dataset and develop a new data augmentation scheme to synthesize training samples by harassing (i) the rich semantics of existing rectified facades and (ii) perspective priors of buildings in diverse street views. Next, we design FloorLevel-Net, a multi-task learning network that associates explicit features of building facades and implicit floor-level lines, along with a height-attention mechanism to help enforce a vertical ordering of floor-level lines. The generated segmentations are then passed to a second-stage geometry post-processing to exploit self-constrained geometric priors for plausible and consistent reconstruction of floor-level lines. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations conducted on assorted facades in existing datasets and street views from Google demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Also, we present context-aware image overlay results and show the potentials of our approach in enriching AR-related applications.

However, DL models are black-box methods hard to debug, interpret, and certify. DL alone cannot provide explanations that can be validated by a non technical audience such as end-users or domain experts. In contrast, symbolic AI systems that convert concepts into rules or symbols - such as knowledge graphs - are easier to explain. However, they present lower generalization and scaling capabilities. A very important challenge is to fuse DL representations with expert knowledge. One way to address this challenge, as well as the performance-explainability trade-off is by leveraging the best of both streams without obviating domain expert knowledge. In this paper, we tackle such problem by considering the symbolic knowledge is expressed in form of a domain expert knowledge graph. We present the eXplainable Neural-symbolic learning (X-NeSyL) methodology, designed to learn both symbolic and deep representations, together with an explainability metric to assess the level of alignment of machine and human expert explanations. The ultimate objective is to fuse DL representations with expert domain knowledge during the learning process so it serves as a sound basis for explainability. In particular, X-NeSyL methodology involves the concrete use of two notions of explanation, both at inference and training time respectively: (1) EXPLANet: Expert-aligned eXplainable Part-based cLAssifier NETwork Architecture, a compositional convolutional neural network that makes use of symbolic representations, and (2) SHAP-Backprop, an explainable AI-informed training procedure that corrects and guides the DL process to align with such symbolic representations in form of knowledge graphs. We showcase X-NeSyL methodology using MonuMAI dataset for monument facade image classification, and demonstrate that with our approach, it is possible to improve explainability at the same time as performance.\",\"In recent years, as machine learning has been widely studied in the field of architecture, scholars have demonstrated that computers can be used to learn the graphical features of building facade generation. However, existing deep learning in facade generation has yet to generate only a single facade, without comprehensive generation of five facades including the roof. Moreover, most of the existing literature has utilized the Pix2Pix algorithm for facade generation experiments, failing to attempt to replace the original generator in Pix2Pix with a different generator for experiments. This study addresses the above issues by collecting and filtering entries from the international Solar Decathlon (SD competition) to obtain a data set. Subsequently, a low-rise residential building facade generation model based on the Pix2Pix neural network was constructed for training and testing. At the same time, the original U-net generator in Pix2Pix was replaced with three different generators, U-net++, HRNet and AttU-net, for training and test results were obtained. The results were evaluated from both subjective and objective aspects and it was found that the AttU-net generative network showed the best comprehensive generation performance for such facades. HRNet is acceptable if there is a need for fast training and generation\",\"3D urban maps with semantic labels and metric information are not only essential for the next generation robots such autonomous vehicles and city drones, but also help to visualize and augment local environment in mobile user applications. The machine vision challenge is to generate accurate urban maps from existing data with minimal manual annotation. In this work, we propose a novel methodology that takes GPS registered LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) point clouds and street view images as inputs and creates semantic labels for the 3D points clouds using a hybrid of rule-based parsing and learning-based labelling that combine point cloud and photometric features. The rule-based parsing boosts segmentation of simple and large structures such as street surfaces and building facades that span almost 75% of the point cloud data. For more complex structures, such as cars, trees and pedestrians, we adopt boosted decision trees that exploit both structure (LiDAR) and photometric (street view) features. We provide qualitative examples of our methodology in 3D visualization where we construct parametric graphical models from labelled data and in 2D image segmentation where 3D labels are back projected to the street view images. In quantitative evaluation we report classification accuracy and computing times and compare results to competing methods with three popular databases: NAVTEQ True, Paris-Rue-Madame and TLS (terrestrial laser scanned) Velodyne.\",\"Deep learning methods are typically data-hungry and require many labelled samples. Unfortunately, the amount of effort required to label the data has significantly hindered the application of deep learning methods, especially in 3D modelling tasks requiring heterogeneous samples. This paper proposes a semi-supervised adversarial recognition strategy embedded in the inverse procedural modelling engine to reduce data annotation costs for learning to model 3D facades. Beginning with textured level-of-details models, we use convolutional neural networks to recognise the types and estimate the parameters of windows from image patches. The window types and parameters are then assembled into the procedural grammar. A simple procedural engine is built inside off-the-shelf 3D modelling software, producing fine-grained window geometries. To obtain a useful model from a few labelled samples, we leverage a generative adversarial network to train the feature extractor in a semi-supervised manner. The adversarial training strategy exploits the unlabelled data to stabilise the training phase. Experiments using publicly available facade image datasets reveal that the proposed methods can improve classification accuracy and parameter estimation by approximately 10% and 50%, respectively, under the same network structure. In addition, performance gains are more pronounced when testing against unseen data featuring different facade styles.\",\"Coarse building mass models are now routinely generated at scales ranging from individual buildings to whole cities. Such models can be abstracted from raw measurements, generated procedurally, or created manually. However, these models typically lack any meaningful geometric or texture details, making them unsuitable for direct display. We introduce the problem of automatically and realistically decorating such models by adding semantically consistent geometric details and textures. Building on the recent success of generative adversarial networks (GANs), we propose FRANKENGAN, a cascade of GANs that creates plausible details across multiple scales over large neighborhoods. The various GANs are synchronized to produce consistent style distributions over buildings and neighborhoods. We provide the user with direct control over the variability of the output. We allow him\\u002fher to interactively specify the style via images and manipulate style-adapted sliders to control style variability. We test our system on several large-scale examples. The generated outputs are qualitatively evaluated via a set of perceptual studies and are found to be realistic, semantically plausible, and consistent in style.\",\"Although functional identifiability represents a key aspect for promoting visual connotation and sustainable usability in historic building groups, there is still no consensus on how to quantitatively describe its identification basis at a large scale. The recent emergence of the potentiality of deep learning and computer vision has provided an alternative to traditional empirical-based judgment, which is limited by its subjective bias and high traversal costs. To address these challenges, this study aims to build a workflow for a visual analysis of function and facade to extract the different contributions that facade elements provide to functional expression. The approach is demonstrated with an experiment on a section of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) where large-scale historical buildings images were categorized to identify functions using deep learning, together with activation and substance for visual calculations. First, the dataset aggregated with images of historic buildings along the CER was used to identify functional categories using SE-DenseNet merging channel attention. The results of the model visualized using t-SNE and Grad-CAM were then used to analyze the relationships of facade features across functional categories and differences in elemental feature representation across functional prototypes. The results show the following: (1) SE-Densenet can more efficiently identify building functions from the closely linked facade images of historic building groups, with the average accuracy reaching 85.84%. (2) Urban-rural differences exist not only in the count of spatial distributions among the CER's historic building groups, but also in a significant visual divergence between functions related to urban life and those involved in the military, industry, and railways. (3) Windows and walls occupy areas with more characteristics, but their decorative elements have a higher intensity of features. The findings could enhance the objective understanding and deeper characteristics of the historical building group system, contributing to integrated conservation and characteristic sustainability.\",\"In this work we test the power of prediction of deep learning for detection of buildings from aerial laser scanner point cloud information. Automatic extraction of built features from remote sensing data is of extreme interest for many applications. In particular latest paradigms of 3D mapping of buildings, such as CityGML and BIM, can benefit from an initial determination of building geometries. In this work we used a LiDAR dataset of urban environment from the ISPRS benchmark on urban object detection. The dataset is labelled with eight classes, two were used for this investigation: roof and facades. The objective is to test how TensorFlow neural network for deep learning can predict these two classes. Results show that for root and facades semantic classes respectively, recall is 84% and 76% and precision is 72% and 63%. The number and distribution of correct points well represent the geometry, thus allowing to use them as support for CityGML and BIM modelling. Further tuning of the hidden layers of the DL model will likely improve results and will be tested in future investigations.\",\"This letter presents a novel method for automated footprint extraction of building facades from mobile LiDAR point clouds. The proposed method first generates the georeferenced feature image of a mobile LiDAR point cloud and then uses image segmentation to extract contour areas which contain facade points of buildings, points of trees, and points of other objects in the georeferenced feature image. After all the points in each contour area are extracted, a classification based on principal component analysis (PCA) method is adopted to identify building objects from point clouds extracted in contour areas. Then, all the points in a building object are segmented into different planes using the random sample consensus algorithm. For each building, points in facade planes are chosen to calculate the direction, the start point, and the end point of the facade footprints using PCA. Finally, footprints of different facades of building are refined, harmonized, and joined. Two data sets of downtown areas and one data set of a residential area captured by Optech's LYNX mobile mapping system were tested to verify the validities of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides a promising and valid solution for automatically extracting building facade footprints from mobile LiDAR point clouds.\",\"This study is part of a project which investigates computational principles which underlie perception and representation of architectural streetscape character. Some of the principles can be associated with fundamental concepts in brain theory and Gestalt psychology. For the experimental analysis streetscapes were represented by sequences of digital images of house facades which were prepared by a team of researchers from architecture. Two methods for non-linear dimensionality reduction, isomap and maximum variance unfolding, were applied to a set of Hough arrays (for tines) of the given images. An analysis of the extracted streetmanifolds revealed groupings of house facades with similar visual character and proportions. Comparative tests were conducted on a simple cylinder shaped example manifold to evaluate the geometric stability of the two dimensionality reduction methods. All experiments addressed variations of the distance metric and the neighbourhood parameter.\",\"The influence of gender is often overlooked in spatial studies of consumption places, and it is challenging to track consumers' perceived preferences due to measurement efficiency and scope issues. Based on machine learning techniques, this paper proposes an approach to map perceived preferences from the local to the city level, and evaluate the physical forms and distribution characteristics of gender-specific consumption places. The application steps are: First, acquire POI (point of interest) coordinates of consumption places to obtain street-view images; then, 30 respondents of each gender are invited to score the sampled images. The area proportions of four prominent visual elements in the building facade are identified by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), after which Random Forest Model is applied to predict the preference scores of all POIs. Finally, the distribution equity of the consumption places of each gender is evaluated by Equilibrium Index. Applying this method in Beijing, we can identify the gender divergence in four aspects of form, function, scale, and administrative district, locate the area with a poor supply of consumption places, and finally provide optimisation suggestions. The method improves the efficiency and scope of measuring consumers' perceived preferences, while identifying and optimising the quality of consumption places.\",\"Facade image parsing is essential to the semantic understanding and 3-D reconstruction of urban scenes. Considering the occlusion and appearance ambiguity in single-view images and the easy acquisition of multiple views, in this letter, we propose a multiview enhanced deep architecture for facade parsing. The highlight of this architecture is a cross-view feature aggregation module that can learn to choose and fuse useful convolutional neural network (CNN) features from nearby views to enhance the representation of a target view. Benefitting from the multiview enhanced representation, the proposed architecture can better deal with the ambiguity and occlusion issues. Moreover, our cross-view feature aggregation module can be straightforwardly integrated into existing single-image parsing frameworks. Extensive comparison experiments and ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method and the validity and transportability of the cross-view feature aggregation module.\",\"With the development of artificial intelligence technology, the ideas of machine learning have been introduced into the field of design in recent years. The research methods of AI + Architecture have brought new ideas for solving traditional problems. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a machine learning model for image generation. Pix2pix is an improved version of GAN, which is specially designed to learn and generate pairs of image data with similar characteristics. In this study, Pix2pix is applied to the recognition and generation of building facade. The purpose is to explore the feasibility of using image generation technology to achieve rapid recognition and generation of building facade based on pix2pix. This paper also discusses the application scenarios of this technology. The existing building facade datasets and the self-made Chinese traditional building datasets are used to test and verify that pix2pix under different types of datasets can nicely identify and generate facade images. Then we summarize a set of working methods based on GAN to realize the overall or local reconstruction design of the facade, so as to provide new ideas for the improvement of the efficiency of related industries and the expansion of teaching tools.\",\"We present a passive computer vision method that exploits existing mapping and navigation databases in order to automatically create 3D building models. Our method defines a grammar for representing changes in building geometry that approximately follow the Manhattan-world assumption which states there is a predominance of three mutually orthogonal directions in the scene. By using multiple calibrated aerial images, we extend previous Manhattan-world methods to robustly produce a single, coherent, complete geometric model of a building with partial textures. Our method uses an optimization to discover a 3D building geometry that produces the same set of facade orientation changes observed in the captured images. We have applied our method to several real-world buildings and have analyzed our approach using synthetic buildings.\",\"The semantic parsing of building facade images is a fundamental yet challenging task in urban scene understanding. Existing works sought to tackle this task by using facade grammars or convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The former can hardly generate parsing results coherent with real images while the latter often fails to capture relationships among facade elements. In this letter, we propose a pyramid atrous large kernel (ALK) network (ALKNet) for the semantic segmentation of facade images. The pyramid ALKNet captures long-range dependencies among building elements by using ALK modules in multiscale feature maps. It makes full use of the regular structures of facades to aggregate useful nonlocal context information and thereby is capable of dealing with challenging image regions caused by occlusions, ambiguities, and so on. Experiments on both rectified and unrectified facade data sets show that ALKNet has better performances than those of state-of-the-art methods.\",\"In this paper we present an approach for semantic interpretation of facade images based on a Convolutional Network. Our network processes the input images in a fully convolutional way and generates pixel-wise predictions. We show that there is no need for large datasets to train the network when transfer learning is employed, i.e., a part of an already existing network is used and fine-tuned, and when the available data is augmented by using deformed patches of the images for training. The network is trained end-to-end with patches of the images and each patch is augmented independently. To undo the downsampling for the classification, we add deconvolutional layers to the network. Outputs of different layers of the network are combined to achieve more precise pixel-wise predictions. We demonstrate the potential of our network based on results for the eTRIMS (Korc and Forstner, 2009) dataset reduced to facades.\",\"Though many methods have been proposed, image completion still remains challenge; besides textured patterns completion, it often requires high-level understanding of scenes and objects being completed. More recently, deep convolutional generative adversarial networks have been turned into an efficient tool for image completion. Manually specified transformation methods are having been replaced with training neural nets. Hand-engineered loss calculations for training the generator are replaced by the loss function provided by the discriminator. With existing deep learning-based approaches, image completion results in high quality but may still lack high-level feature details or contain artificial appearance. In our completion architecture, we leverage a fully convolutional generator with two subnetworks as our basic completion approach and divide the problem into two steps: The first subnetwork generates the outline of a completed image in a new domain, and the second subnetwork translates the outline to a visually realistic output with image-to-image translation. The feedforward fully convolutional network can complete images with holes of any size at any location. We compare our method with several existing ones on representative datasets such as CelebA, ImageNet, Places2 and CMP Facade. The evaluations demonstrate that our model significantly improves the completion results.\",\"Facade features represent segmentations of building surfaces and can serve as a building framework. Extracting facade features from three-dimensional (3D) point cloud data (3D PCD) is an efficient method for 3D building modeling. By combining the advantages of 3D PCD and two-dimensional optical images, this study describes the creation of a highly accurate building facade feature extraction method from 3D PCD with a focus on structural information. The new extraction method involves three major steps: image feature extraction, exploration of the mapping method between the image features and 3D PCD, and optimization of the initial 3D PCD facade features considering structural information. Results show that the new method can extract the 3D PCD facade features of buildings more accurately and continuously. The new method is validated using a case study. In addition, the effectiveness of the new method is demonstrated by comparing it with the range image-extraction method and the optical image-extraction method in the absence of structural information. The 3D PCD facade features extracted by the new method can be applied in many fields, such as 3D building modeling and building information modeling.\",\"Recent years have shown a shift from pure geometric 3D city models to data with semantics. This is induced by new applications (e.g. Virtual\\u002fAugmented Reality) and also a requirement for concepts like Smart Cities. However, essential urban semantic data like building use categories is often not available. We present a first step in bridging this gap by proposing a pipeline to use crawled urban imagery and link it with ground truth cadastral data as an input for automatic building use classification. We aim to extract this city-relevant semantic information automatically from Street View (SV) imagery. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) proved to be extremely successful for image interpretation, however, require a huge amount of training data. Main contribution of the paper is the automatic provision of such training datasets by linking semantic information as already available from databases provided from national mapping agencies or city administrations to the corresponding facade images extracted from SV. Finally, we present first investigations with a CNN and an alternative classifier as a proof of concept.\",\"Procedural modeling has proven to be a very valuable tool in the field of architecture. In the last few years, research has soared to automatically create procedural models from images. However, current algorithms for this process of inverse procedural modeling rely on the assumption that the building style is known. So far, the determination of the building style has remained a manual task. In this paper, we propose an algorithm which automates this process through classification of architectural styles from facade images. Our classifier first identifies the images containing buildings, then separates individual facades within an image and determines the building style. This information could then be used to initialize the building reconstruction process. We have trained our classifier to distinguish between several distinct architectural styles, namely Flemish Renaissance, Haussmannian and Neoclassical. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on various street-side images.\",\"The fast and automatic facade extraction method is an important step to retrieve actual information about cities. It helps to maintain a public registry, may be used to examine the technical condition of buildings or in process of city planning. We propose an automatic method to detect and retrieve building facades from spherical images. Our method uses deep learning models trained on automatically labelled spherical images collected in the virtual city we have generated. Finally, we compare the proposed solution using three different deep learning models with a classic method. Our experiment revealed that the proposed approach has a similar or better performance than the current methods. Moreover, our solution works with unprepared data, while existing methods require data pre-processing.\",\"Traditional techniques for recording and modelling historical buildings using surveying instruments and CAD are tedious and time-consuming procedures, which do not provide detailed descriptions of complex facades. Recent developments in photogrammetry and laser-scanning techniques present non-contact, flexible and accessible surveying tools for 2D-3D recording. This paper discusses the potential for combining photogrammetry, laser scanning and computer vision for the documentation of heritage sites. By these means the efficiency of data collection can be optimized, and accurate true orthophotos of the studied structure can be generated using precise 3D surface representations derived from laser scanning and overlapping digital images. The final product allows the creation of detailed and complete facade plans, which are both graphically superior and accurate. The paper includes a study of the approach applied to historic buildings in Gharissa, one of the best preserved heritage villages in Jordan.\",\"Realistic representation of building walls from images is an important aspect of scene understanding and has many applications. Often, images of buildings are the only input for texturing 3D models, and these images may be occluded by vegetation. One task of image inpainting is to remove these clutter objects. Since the disturbing objects can also be of a larger scale, modern deep learning techniques should be applied to replace them as realistically and context-aware as possible. To support an inpainting network, it is useful to include a-priori information. An example of a network that considers edge images is the two-stage GAN model denoted as EdgeConnect. This idea is taken up in this work and further developed to a three-stage GAN (3GAN) model for facade images by additionally incorporating semantic label images. By inpainting the label images, not only a clear geometric structure but also class information, like position and shape of windows and their typical color distribution, are provided to the model. This model is compared qualitatively and quantitatively with the conventional version of EdgeConnect and another well-known deep-learning-based approach on inpainting which is based on partial convolutions. This latter approach was outperformed by both GAN-based methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively. While the quantitative evaluation showed that the conventional EdgeConnect method performs minimally best, the proposed method yields a slightly better representation of specific facade elements.\",\"We present a saliency-guided algorithm for detecting the locations of repetitive structures on building facades. First, the global and local saliencies of each point are determined by measuring the global rarity and the local distinctness. The saliency map is utilized to adaptively extract the salient points. Second, the salient points are vertically sliced. A curve can be derived by counting the total number of points in each slice. Then, the curve is converted into a square wave to locate the vertical splitting position. Next, each segment is horizontally sliced, similar to the vertical splitting. The salient points are partitioned into repetitive candidates after the vertical and horizontal splitting. Finally, the repetitive candidates are refined according to the similarity of the neighborhood and the regularity of the arrangement. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can quickly and effectively extract repetitions from facade point clouds.\",\"Building retrofit is an important facet in the drive to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. However, delivering building retrofit at scale is a significant challenge, especially in how to automate the process of building surveying. On-site survey by expert surveyors is the main approach in the industry. This can lead to a high workload if planning retrofit at a large-scale. An advanced vehicle-mounted data capturing system has been built to collect urban environmental multi-spectral data. The data contains substantial information that is essential in identifying building retrofit needs. Although the data capturing system is able to collect data in a highly-efficient manner, the data analysis is still a big data challenge to apply the system into delivering building retrofit plans. In this paper, a street-view building facade image segmentation model is designed as the foundation of the holistic data analysis framework. The model is developed on the deep learning-based semantic segmentation technology and uses an ensemble learning strategy. The object detection technology is fused into the model as an magnifier to improve the model performance on small objects and boundary predictions. The model has achieved state-of-the-art levels of accuracy on a built street-view building facade image dataset.\",\"Array interferometric synthetic aperture radar (Array InSAR) has a 3-D resolution capability and solves the layover problem in interferometric SAR (InSAR) by arranging multiple antennas in the cross-orbit direction. Airborne Array InSAR point clouds are obtained from two scans for complete building information in urban areas, resulting in very low overlapping point cloud. The existing methods are difficult to extract the identical features for the registration of Array InSAR point clouds. To this end, a robust registration approach Array InSAR point clouds in urban areas is proposed in this study. The main contribution of this article is raising the theoretically optimal transformation for achieving point cloud registration, considering the constraint from parallel facades of a certain building. Point density estimation is adopted to retain building facade points for initial registration. The facade pairs of a specific building are then matched and divided into two categories by judging whether one contains the concave-convex features or not, for performing rotation rectification and fine shift fixation, respectively. Experimental results of both simulated and real data validate the feasibility and reliability of our approach. For the simulated data, the results reach an average rotation error of about 0.01 degrees and an average translation error of less than 0.8 m. For the real data, two evaluation criteria are designed for the lack of reference data. The results reach an average of 0.4 degrees of the defined angle difference and less 0.8-m distance difference from the source facades center to the normal extension of the target facades.\",\"The construction industry has made great strides in recent decades by utilizing computer programs, including computer aided design programs. However, compared to the manufacturing sector, labor productivity is low because of the high proportion of knowledge-based tasks and simple repetitive tasks. Therefore, knowledge-based task efficiency should be improved through the visual recognition of information by computers. A computer requires a large amount of training data, such as the ImageNet project, to recognize visual information. This paper proposes facade datasets that are efficiently constructed by quickly collecting facade data through road-view images generated from web portals and automatically labeled using deep learning as part of the construction of image datasets for visual recognition construction by a computer. Therefore, we attempted to automatically label facade images to quickly generate large-scale facade datasets with much less effort than the existing research methods. Simultaneously, we constructed datasets for a part of Dongseong-ro, Daegu Metropolitan City, and analyzed their utility and reliability. It was confirmed that the computer could extract significant facade information from the road-view images by recognizing the visual information of the facade image. In addition, we verified the characteristics of the building construction image datasets. This study suggests the possibility of securing quantitative and qualitative facade design knowledge by extracting facade design information from facades anywhere in the world. Previous studies mainly collected facade images through camera photography to construct databases, but in this study, a significant part of the database construction process was shortened through automation. In the case of facade automatic image labeling studies, it is the facade-based automatic 3D modeling which has been primarily studied, but it is difficult to find a study to extract data for facade design research.\",\"This article presents a machine learning approach to automatic land use categorization based on a convolutional artificial neural network architecture. It is intended to support the detection and classification of building facades in order to associate each building with its respective land use. Replacing the time-consuming manual acquisition of images in the field and subsequent interpretation of the data with computer-aided techniques facilitates the creation of useful maps for urban planning. A specific future objective of this study is to monitor the commercial evolution in the city of Vila Velha, Brazil. The initial step is object detection based on a deep network architecture called Faster R-CNN. The model is trained on a collection of street-level photographs of buildings of desired land uses, from a database of annotated images of building facades. Images are extracted from Google Street View scenes. Furthermore, in order to save manual annotation time, a semi-supervised dual pipeline method is proposed that uses a pre-trained predictor model from the Places365 database to learn unannotated images. Several backbones were connected to the Faster R-CNN architecture for comparisons. The experimental results with the VGG backbone show an improvement over published works, with an average accuracy of 86.49%.\",\"In the era of Big Data, 3D electronic maps and GIS are widely used in geographic information analysis and urban computing. However, the production cost of electronic maps is expensive, especially that of 3D modeling of buildings that are important geographic objects. In this paper, we propose a fast and low-cost method for 3D modeling of buildings by using building images provided by online electronic maps. The method employs edge detection to identify the bottom contours of buildings in 2D building images; it then takes DNN-based object detection and semantic segmentation to spill a single building from 3D building images, and calculates the height of the building facades. We use this approach to model 22,740 3D buildings in the urban area of Nanjing, and take a 5m high-resolution electronic map as the benchmark to evaluate the modeling accuracy. The results show that image-based 3D building modeling is able to provide acceptable-precision 3D geometry information of buildings.\",\"Collecting 3D point cloud data of buildings is important for many applications such as urban mapping, renovation, preservation, and energy simulation. However, laser-scanned point clouds are often difficult to analyze, visualize, and interpret due to incompletely scanned building facades caused by numerous sources of defects such as noise, occlusions, and moving objects. Several point cloud scene completion algorithms have been proposed in the literature, but they have been mostly applied to individual objects or small-scale indoor environments and not on large-scale scans of building facades. This paper introduces a method of performing point cloud scene completion of building facades using orthographic projection and generative adversarial inpainting methods. The point cloud is first converted into the 2D structured representation of depth and color images using an orthographic projection approach. Then, a data-driven 2D inpainting approach is used to predict the complete version of the scene, given the incomplete scene in the image domain. The 2D inpainting process is fully automated and uses a customized generative-adversarial network based on Pix2Pix that is trainable end-to-end. The inpainted 2D image is finally converted back into a 3D point cloud using depth remapping. The proposed method is compared against several baseline methods, including geometric methods such as Poisson reconstruction and hole-filling, as well as learning-based methods such as the point completion network (PCN) and TopNet. Performance evaluation is carried out based on the task of reconstructing real-world building facades from partial laser-scanned point clouds. Experimental results using the performance metrics of voxel precision, voxel recall, position error, and color error showed that the proposed method has the best performance overall.\",\"In this work, we present a framework to detect objects embedded in complex perspective geometry. Our goal is to accurately identify objects such as people standing in balconies or windows on building facades of surrounding buildings. Compared to traditional computer vision work focused on activity analysis from a horizontal view, our framework provides a solution for the application domain of mobile surveillance in urban areas. A novel solution for a monocular camera is formulated by tightly coupling various computational modules including geometric analysis, segmentation, scale estimation, and object detection. In particular, our proposed approach alleviates the effect of the perspective geometry and corresponding distortion in object appearance effectively, and provides accurate scale priors to eliminate unlikely object detection hypotheses. The experimental results on collected video dataset show that the proposed approach is more accurate than traditional detection approaches based on brute-force scanning windows.\",\"Street-level imagery contains a variety of visual information about the facades of Points of Interest (POIs). In addition to general morphological features, signs on the facades of, primarily, business-related POIs could be a valuable source of information about the type and identity of a POI. Recent advancements in computer vision could leverage visual information from street-level imagery, and contribute to the classification of POIs. However, there is currently a gap in existing literature regarding the use of visual labels contained in street-level imagery, where their value as indicators of POI categories is assessed. This paper presents Scene-Text Semantics (ST-Sem), a novel method that leverages visual labels (e.g., texts, logos) from street-level imagery as complementary information for the categorization of business-related POIs. Contrary to existing methods that fuse visual and textual information at a feature-level, we propose a late fusion approach that combines visual and textual cues after resolving issues of incorrect digitization and semantic ambiguity of the retrieved textual components. Experiments on two existing and a newly-created datasets show that ST-Sem can outperform visual-only approaches by 80% and related multimodal approaches by 4%.\",\"The experience of walking through a city is influenced by amenities and the visual qualities of its built environment. This paper uses thousands of pedestrian trajectories obtained from GPS signals to construct a desirability index for streets in Boston. We create the index by comparing the actual paths taken by pedestrians with the shortest path between any origin-destination pairs. The index captures pedestrians' willingness to deviate from their shortest path and provides a measure of the scenic and experience value provided by different parts of the city. We then use computer vision techniques combined with georeferenced data to measure the built environment of streets. We show that desirable streets have better access to public amenities such as parks, sidewalks, and urban furniture. They are also sinuous, visually enclosed, have less complex facades, and have more diverse business establishments. These results further our understanding of the value that the built environment brings to pedestrians, enhancing our capacity to design more lively and functional environments.\",\"Image segmentation is a fundamental task that has benefited from recent advances in machine learning. One type of segmentation, of particular interest to computer vision, is that of urban segmentation. Although recent solutions have leveraged on deep neural networks, approaches usually do not consider regularities appearing in facade structures (e.g., windows are often in groups of similar alignment, size, or spacing patterns) as well as additional urban structures such as building footprints and roofs. Moreover, both satellite and street view images are often noisy and occluded, thus getting the complete structure segmentation from a partial observation is difficult. Our key observations are that facades and other urban structures exhibit regular structures, and additional views are often available. In this paper, we present a novel framework (RFCNet) that consists of three modules to achieve multiple goals. Specifically, we propose Regularization to improve the regularities given an initial segmentation, Fusion that fuses multiple views of the segmentation, and Completion that can infer the complete structure if necessary. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively for multiple facade datasets. Furthermore, by applying our framework to other urban structures (e.g., building footprints and roofs), we demonstrate our approach can be generalized to various pattern types.\",\"The judgment of facade styles is an important part of the sustainable utilization and restorative process of historical architectures. Contemporary Harbin needs the help of modern architectural facade forms in the planning of the famous historic city, especially with the facade renovation of old architectures with non-cultural heritage. This paper discusses the possibility of applying advanced image recognition algorithms to the classification of the modern Harbin architectural facade styles and argues that the keys to the classification and positioning of the styles are the forms, the details, and the decorative patterns of the architectural facades, together with the deformation and the quantitative variation factors of the facade decoration symbols. Based on the conventional classification method, the facade styles of Harbin modern architecture were divided into 12 categories after data analysis. To better capture the overall structure information and the style features of the local components in the architectural images, the group convolution and the dilated convolution were added into the ResNet model, and then, the improved channel attention mechanism was introduced to construct a novel CA-MSResNet model. The CA-MSResNet model could more accurately identify the morphological elements and the style categories of the architectures, and the average accuracy reached 87.5%. These techniques, with their promising results, are expected to be further applied in the future research on the sustainable utilization and renovation of Harbin modern architecture.\",\"In this paper we present a novel street scene semantic recognition framework, which takes advantage of 3D point cloud captured by a high definition LiDAR laser scanner. An important problem in object recognition is the need for sufficient labeled training data to learn robust classifiers. We show how to significantly reduce the need for manually labeled training data by reduction of scene complexity using non-supervised ground and building segmentation. Our system first automatically segments grounds point cloud. Then, using binary range image processing building facades will be detected. Remained point cloud will grouped into voxels which are then transformed to super voxels. Local 3D features extracted from super voxels are classified by trained boosted decision trees and labeled with semantic classes e.g. tree, pedestrian, car. Given labeled 3D points cloud and 2D image with known viewing camera pose, the proposed association module aligned collections of 3D points to the groups of 2D image pixel to parsing 2D cubic images.\",\"In architecture, urban culture inheritance plays a nontrivial role in the urban renovation of a city. The existing design workflow for architects is laborious from the research phase to the final plans, and yet the results are subjective, especially when facing a large-scale urban renovation. Recent works show that generative adversarial networks (GANs) have surprising potential for creating un-presented images following certain rules under various domains, including architecture. However, research on adopting GANs to optimize the conventional design process of historic urban areas renovation is still missing. This study contributes as a decision support tool for urban renovation based on GANs to abstract historic architecture styles and automatically generate stylized facades. One self-made dataset of facade and label information from Harbin Central Street was created, and one data augmentation process was proposed and examined. The generated designs were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, and demonstrated high accuracy, reality, and diversity levels. Two in situ and off-site applications proved the feasibility and adaptability of the proposed workflow. Through all evaluations and application cases, it is justified that the proposed GAN-based design strategy can greatly benefit the conventional historic urban area renovation design process.\",\"Given the present size of modern cities, it is beyond the perceptual capacity of most people to develop a good knowledge about the qualities of the urban space at every street corner. Correspondingly, for planners, it is also difficult to accurately answer questions such as 'where the quality of the physical environment is the most dilapidated in the city that regeneration should be given first consideration' and 'in fast urbanising cities, how is the city appearance changing'. To address this issue, in the present study, we present a computer vision method that contains three machine learning models for the large-scale and automatic evaluation on the qualities of the urban environment by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and wide-coverage street view images. From various physical qualities that have been identified by previous research to be important for the urban visual experience, we choose two key qualities, the construction and maintenance quality of building facade and the continuity of street wall, to be measured in this research. To test the validity of the proposed method, we compare the machine scores with public rating scores collected on-site from 752 passers-by at 56 locations in the city. We show that the machine learning models can produce a medium-to-good estimation of people's real experience, and the modelling results can be applied in many ways by researchers, planners and local residents.\",\"Outdoor advertising influences the visual environment of any modem city. Advertising and information signs on building facades are one of the types of outdoor advertising. As a rule, there are laws and design codes in cities that define permissible look of such signs. At the same time, in metropolises, there is a problem of timely detection of advertising constructions on facades that violate these rules. City-scale monitoring of facade conditions is beyond the capabilities of any city's authorities. To address this issue, we propose a solution which combines street-view maps and machine learning to automate the process of searching for law-breaking advertising objects on building facades. We develop a dataset for a machine learning model and a set of checks for detected advertising objects to check their legality. The resulting approach can provide data for future research and help maintain coherent urban visual environment.\",\"Semantic Inpainting on Segmentation Map (SISM) aims to manipulate segmentation maps by semantics. Recent works show SISM provides semantic-aware auxiliary information for better style or structure manipulations. Providing structural assistance, segmentation maps have been broadly used as an intermediate interface to achieve better image manipulation. Mainstream solutions of image manipulation use Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) globally, locally or jointly. It is also applicable to SISM. However, the discriminator of global GAN is easier fooled, because the majority of its input is the same as the ground-truth, which is hard to fully mitigate the inconsistency between inpainted areas and the context. The inconsistency is more difficult for local GAN to address, due to the lack of context in its input. To mitigate the inconsistency, we propose a novel Multi-Expansion (MEx) loss. It is implemented by the adversarial loss on MEx areas. Each MEx area has the inpainted area as dominance and keeps knowledge of the scene context, so the consistency of the SISM results can be boosted. We propose an approximation of MEx loss, i.e., A-MEx loss, to further enhance the stability and usability. Besides performing well on SISM tasks, MEx loss also performs impressively on natural image inpainting. Extensive experiments on the two tasks demonstrate the advantages of our model over existing methods on four challenging datasets, such as a 2.59% increase in Hamm on SISM in Cityscape and a decrease of 5.00% FID on natural image inpainting in CMP Facade. The code of our work is available at: https:\\u002f\\u002fgithub.com\\u002fhe159ok\\u002fAMExMEx-Loss.\",\"In the context of the global construction of low-carbon cities and residents' pursuit of healthy living, the improvement in the urban walking environment has gradually been emphasized in the field of planning and transportation research. Using Harbin, China, as an example, this paper combines gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs) and impact-asymmetry analysis (IAA) methods to explore the differences in residents' preferences for the pedestrian environment needs in old and new urban areas, analyze the asymmetric relationship between walking environment factors and overall satisfaction, and provide a sound basis for the renewal and reconstruction of the walking environment in old urban areas and the improvement of the walking environment in new urban areas. The factors affecting the pedestrian environment in the old and new urban areas are similar and different, with the aesthetics and safety and the aesthetics and comfort of the pedestrian environment having a greater impact on the old and new urban areas, respectively. According to the results of the IAA, the old city should focus on improving green landscaping, street furniture, the uncivilized behavior of pedestrians, pavement encroachment, barrier-free facilities, and the speed of motor vehicles; the new city should focus on improving the building facade effect, the uncivilized behavior of pedestrians, and green landscaping.\",\"3D modeling remains a notoriously difficult task for novices despite significant research effort to provide intuitive and automated systems. We tackle this problem by combining the strengths of two popular domains: sketch-based modeling and procedural modeling. On the one hand, sketch-based modeling exploits our ability to draw but requires detailed, unambiguous drawings to achieve complex models. On the other hand, procedural modeling automates the creation of precise and detailed geometry but requires the tedious definition and parameterization of procedural models. Our system uses a collection of simple procedural grammars, called snippets, as building blocks to turn sketches into realistic 3D models. We use a machine learning approach to solve the inverse problem of finding the procedural model that best explains a user sketch. We use nonphotorealistic rendering to generate artificial data for training convolutional neural networks capable of quickly recognizing the procedural rule intended by a sketch and estimating its parameters. We integrate our algorithm in a coarse-to-fine urban modeling system that allows users to create rich buildings by successively sketching the building mass, roof, facades, windows, and ornaments. A user study shows that by using our approach non-expert users can generate complex buildings in just a few minutes.\",\"In a great variety of applications, such as real-time robot localization and visual navigation, architectural design, 3D city reconstruction, building recognition in urban environments is required. In this work a comparative study of visual feature extraction methods for building retrieval on urban databases is performed. To this end, a database of 183 building facades taken at two different regions near the center of Athens was created. Five feature extraction methods are used in order to capture visual properties. Features between images are then matched using RANSAC algorithm and a visual transformation is calculated. Comparative retrieval results are provided and discussed.\",\"Facade parsing aims to decompose a building facade image into semantic regions of the facade objects. Considering each architectural element on a facade as a parameterized rectangle, we formulate the facade parsing task as object detection, allowing overlapping and nesting, which will support structural 3D modeling and editing for further applications. In contrast to general object detection, the spatial arrangement regularity and appearance similarity between the facade elements of the same category provide valuable context for accurate element localization. In this paper, we propose to exploit the spatial arrangement regularity and appearance similarity of facade elements in a detection framework. Our element-arrangement context network (EACNet) consists of two unidirectional attention branches, one to capture the column-context and the other to capture row-context to aggregate element-specific features from multiple instances on the facade. We conduct extensive experiments on four public datasets (ECP, CMP, Graz50, and eTRIMS). The proposed EACNet achieves the highest mIoU (82.1% on ECP, 77.35% on Graz50, and 82.3% on eTRIMS) compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Both the quantitative and qualitative evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual unidirectional attention branches to parse facade elements.\",\"In this study, we propose a straight-line-segment feature-extraction method for the building-facade point-cloud data based on slicing to improve the existing method of detecting and extracting the straight-line-segment features from the building-fa ade point-cloud data, which exhibits problems of missed detection and less-thanoptimal accuracy. Further, the point cloud is sliced along the three coordinate axes after adjusting the point-cloud attitude of the building to ensure that its orientation is consistent with the Y-coordinate axis. Then, the feature points on each slice arc extracted, and straight-line-segment clustering is applied to the extracted feature points based on the cylinder growth method. Finally, the straight-line-segment fitting of the feature points is performed using the 1-norm minimum residual algorithm, and the endpoints of the straight line segment arc adjusted and refined. Subsequently, we validate the proposed method by applying it to several sets of experimental data; the experimental results exhibit improved accuracy, precision, and recall. The extraction accuracy of the straight line segment is half the average point spacing in the point cloud. The precision of the proposed method for extracting straight line segments is increased by 2.4% on average than that of the plane segmentation and image detection methods, whereas the recall is increased by 18.1% on average. Thus, our proposed method can accurately and effectively extract straight line segments from the building-facade point-cloud data.\",\"Facade parsing is an essential process before the 3-D modeling of digital or virtual 3-D city models. The existing grammar-based approaches for facade parsing rely on strong prior knowledge but can obtain facade parts with better structure. Pixelwise-segmentation-based approaches achieve facade parsing with much less knowledge but the resulting structure of facade parts is normally incomplete. Both these approaches are restricted by their high reliance on the data set. Therefore, they cannot be applied for facade parsing with complex scenes. To address this issue, we built a large street-level data set by taking Mapillary images as the training data for more general scenes. At the same time, we propose a new pipeline based on convolutional neural network (CNN) that combines pixelwise segmentation and global object detection to achieve better results for facade parsing. Our pipeline can be applied to facade images after rectification and street-level facade images with complex scenes. The result of the ablation study demonstrates that the design of our pipeline is effective. We test our pipeline on the classic ECP2011 data set and our new large street-level data set. Our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results for both the data sets: an accuracy of 98.2% and the mean average precision (mAP) of 98.8% on the ECP2011 data set as well as the mAP of 81.1% for facade parts parsing on our street-level data set.\",\"This paper presents an architecture for image analysis that is based on feature hierarchies. The architecture allows for shift, scale, and topological invariant detection of objects. Features are efficiently represented and combined dynamically during the detection process. The respective feature detectors are trained using a supervised learning scheme. The method discussed here can also solve the problem of segmenting an image into image regions that correspond to detected features. This segmentation can be done through backtracking of feature information in the feature hierarchy. We applied the method for a set of images where building facades are analyzed and show experimental results that demonstrate the capabilities of the system.\",\"In this paper we present a novel street scene semantic recognition framework, which takes advantage of 3D point clouds captured by a high-definition LiDAR laser scanner.

In this paper we show how to significantly reduce the need for manually labeled training data by reduction of scene complexity using non-supervised ground and building segmentation. Our system first automatically segments grounds point cloud, this is because the ground connects almost all other objects and we will use a connect component based algorithm to oversegment the point clouds. Then, using binary range image processing building facades will be detected. Remained point cloud will grouped into voxels which are then transformed to super voxels. Local 3D features extracted from super voxels are classified by trained boosted decision trees and labeled with semantic classes e.g. tree, pedestrian, car, etc. The proposed method is evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively on a challenging fixed-position Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) Velodyne data set and two Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS), Paris-rue-Madam and NAVTEQ True databases. Robust scene parsing results are reported.\",\"Windows are key components of building facades. Detecting windows, crucial to 3D semantic reconstruction and scene parsing, is a challenging task in computer vision. Early methods try to solve window detection by using hand-crafted features and traditional classifiers. However, these methods are unable to handle the diversity of window instances in real scenes and suffer from heavy computational costs. Recently, convolutional neural networks based object detection algorithms attract much attention due to their good performances. Unfortunately, directly training them for challenging window detection cannot achieve satisfying results. In this paper, we propose an approach for window detection. It involves an improved Faster R-CNN architecture for window detection, featuring in a window region proposal network, an RoI feature fusion and a context enhancement module. Besides, a post optimization process is designed by the regular distribution of windows to refine detection results obtained by the improved deep architecture. Furthermore, we present a newly collected dataset which is the largest one for window detection in real street scenes to date. Experimental results on both existing datasets and the new dataset show that the proposed method has outstanding performance.\",\"Buildings and other man-made objects, for many reasons such as economical or aesthetic, are often characterized by their symmetry. The latter predominates in the design of building footprints and building parts such as facades. Thus the identification and modeling of this valuable information facilitates the reconstruction of these buildings and their parts. This article presents a novel approach for the automatic identification and modelling of symmetries and their hierarchical structures in building footprints, providing an important prior for facade and roof reconstruction. The uncertainty of symmetries is explicitly addressed using supervised machine learning methods, in particular Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Unlike classical statistical methods, for SVMs assumptions on the a priori distribution of the data are not required. Both axial and translational symmetries are detected. The quality of the identified major and minor symmetry axes is assessed by a least squares based adjustment. Context-free formal grammar rules are used to model the hierarchical and repetitive structure of the underlying footprints. We present an algorithm which derives grammar rules based on the previously acquired symmetry information and using lexical analysis describing regular patterns and palindrome-like structures. This offers insights into the latent structures of building footprints and therefore describes the associated facade in a relational and compact way.\",\"Building facade elements are an important foundation for smart cities. As buildings exhibit an array of textures and geometric forms, the process of image acquisition is easily affected, although the robustness of texture in scenes (e.g., dilapidated buildings) is poor, with high point cloud data, and low recognition efficiency; therefore, the accuracy of building element extraction based on a single data source remains limited. In this research, a method for building facade element extraction based on multidimensional virtual semantic feature map ensemble learning and hierarchical clustering is proposed. Point clouds were obtained by multi-view images, and then the multidimensional virtual semantic feature maps, including color, texture, orientation, and curvature semantics, were acquired via reprojection. The multi-semantic feature block pre-segmentation, considering multiple features, was obtained by ensemble learning, and a hierarchical clustering strategy was established for to achieve fine extraction of building facade elements. Experiments were conducted across multiple building types, and the results showed that: 1) The method can use different virtual semantic feature map and clustering strategies to achieve accurate extraction of diverse building facade elements; 2) The method achieved joint learning tasks in both 2D and 3D space; and, 3) The proposed method achieved fine extraction of building elements with pixel accuracy (PA) over 70% in all experiments and mean intersection over union (mIoU) up to 95%, which were better than the image based method. In summary, this method offers a novel, more reliable method for segmenting and extracting building facade elements, which has important theoretical and practical significance.\",\"This paper introduces a fast and efficient segmentation technique for 2D images and 3D point clouds of building facades. Facades of buildings are highly structured and consequently most methods that have been proposed for this problem aim to make use of this strong prior information. Contrary to most prior work, we are describing a system that is almost domain independent and consists of standard segmentation methods. We train a sequence of boosted decision trees using auto-context features. This is learned using stacked generalization. We find that this technique performs better, or comparable with all previous published methods and present empirical results on all available 2D and 3D facade benchmark datasets. The proposed method is simple to implement, easy to extend, and very efficient at test-time inference.\",\"The parsing of building facades is a key component to the problem of 3D street scenes reconstruction, which is long desired in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based method for segmenting a facade into semantic categories. Man-made structures often present the characteristic of symmetry. Based on this observation, we propose a symmetric regularizer for training the neural network. Our proposed method can make use of both the power of deep neural networks and the structure of man-made architectures. We also propose a method to refine the segmentation results using bounding boxes generated by the Region Proposal Network. We test our method by training a FCN-8s network with the novel loss function. Experimental results show that our method has outperformed previous state-of-the-art methods significantly on both the ECP dataset and the eTRIMS dataset. As far as we know, we are the first to employ end-to-end deep convolutional neural network on full image scale in the task of building facades parsing.\",\"An important part of art history can be discovered through the visual information in monument facades. However, the analysis of this visual information, i.e, morphology and architectural elements, requires high expert knowledge. An automatic system for identifying the architectural style or detecting the architectural elements of a monument based on one image will certainly help improving our knowledge in art and history. Building such tool is challenging as some styles share architectural elements, the bad conservation state of some monuments and the noise included in the image itself. The aim of this paper is to introduce MonuMAI (Monument with Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence) framework. In particular, (i) we designed MonuMAI dataset rich with expert knowledge considering the proposed architectural styles taxonomy and key elements relationship, which allows addressing several tasks, e.g., monument style classification and architectural elements detection, (ii) we developed MonuMAI deep learning pipeline based on lightweight MonuNet architecture for monument style classification and MonuMAI Key Elements Detection (MonuMAI-KED) model, and (iii) we built citizen science based MonuMAI mobile app that uses the proposed MonuMAI deep learning pipeline trained on MonuMAI dataset for performing in real life conditions. Our experiments show that both MonuNet architecture and the detection model achieve very good results under real life conditions.\",\"Rapid urbanization and global warming have increased heat stress in urban areas. This in turn makes using indoor space more compelling and leads to more energy consumption. Therefore, paying attention to outdoor spaces design with thermal comfort in mind becomes more important since outdoor spaces can host a variety of activities. This research aims to introduce a machine learning-based framework to predict the effects of different urban configurations (i.e. different greening configurations and types, different facade materials, and different urban geometry) on outdoor thermal comfort through training a pix2pix Convolutional generative adversarial network (cGAN) model. For the training of the machine learning model, a dataset consisting of 208 coupled pictures of input and output has been created. The simulation of this data has been carried out by ENVI-met. The resulting machine learning model had a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 96% on the test dataset with the highest SSIM of 97.08 and lowest of 94.43 which shows the high accuracy of the model and it could have reached an answer in 3 s compared to the 30-min average time for ENVI-met simulation. The resulting model shows great promise for assisting researchers and urban designers in studying existing urban contexts or planning new developments.\",\"Terrestrial Laser Scanners (TLS) are used to get dense point samples of large object's surface. TLS is new and efficient method to digitize large object or scene. The collected point samples come into different formats and coordinates. Different scans are required to scan large object such as heritage site. Point cloud registration is considered as important task to bring different scans into whole 3D model in one coordinate system. Point clouds can be registered by using one of the three ways or combination of them, Target based, feature extraction, point cloud based. For the present study we have gone through Point Cloud Based registration approach. We have collected partially overlapped 3D Point Cloud data of Department of Computer Science & IT (DCSIT) building located in Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, Aurangabad. To get the complete point cloud information of the building we have taken 12 scans, 4 scans for exterior and 8 scans for interior facade data collection. There are various algorithms available in literature, but Iterative Closest Point (ICP) is most dominant algorithms. The various researchers have developed variants of ICP for better registration process. The ICP point cloud registration algorithm is based on the search of pairs of nearest points in a two adjacent scans and calculates the transformation parameters between them, it provides advantage that no artificial target is required for registration process. We studied and implemented three variants Brute Force, KDTree, Partial Matching of ICP algorithm in MATLAB. The result shows that the implemented version of ICP algorithm with its variants gives better result with speed and accuracy of registration as compared with CloudCompare Open Source software.\",\"3D Building facade reconstruction enables the implementation of delicate actions related to restoration, support and presentation of architectural structures. In particular, model complexity can be significantly reduced through the incorporation of computer vision and image processing tools, aiming towards the estimation of structural 3D feature characteristics instead of their actual GPS specification. In this paper we present a strategy for constructing reduced-complexity 3D models, which combines stereo vision images and morphological processing methods. Initially, the building skeleton is extracted and modeled with the use of Hough transformation and Active Contours. Subsequently, the building's facade depth map is derived using the stereo camera layout, for the refinement of inner skeleton details, such as the protrusion of windows or doors. These image-driven features are fused with Georeferenced data in order to complete the full building's skeleton model. The proposed reconstruction framework is tested on the site of Neoria buildings, a historical (Venetian) site in Chania, Crete, Greece.\",\"The Architectural Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry can benefit from accurate building facade segmentation, which can provide valuable insights into building maintenance, urban planning, and security efforts. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors are effective in recognizing building facade components from (three-dimensional) 3D point clouds by regis-tering 3D spatial coordinates and radiometric information, which reveal the spectral property of a scanned surface. Although the radiometric information (i.e., intensity feature) can be used for segmentation, its accuracy may be reduced by factors such as scanning geometry and external factors that affect the object's radiometric information. To address this issue, this study proposes a robust and automated method for segmenting building facade components using LiDAR point cloud data and an empirical-based intensity correction model to ensure proper segmentation. The proposed method employs RandLA-Net, a deep learning model capable of effectively processing large-scale point cloud data, to classify building facade components based on their spatial features combined with corrected intensity features. By incorporating the proposed method into a digital twin, it is possible to perform accurate building facade segmentation and generate valuable insights into the building's physical condition, energy efficiency, and aesthetic value in real-time. The effectiveness of the proposed method was experimentally validated using a school building facade, which demonstrated significant improvements in the recognition of facade components and highlighted the potential of digital twin-enabled building facade segmentation for the AEC industry.\",\"This paper presents a data-driven workflow for the detection of scaffolding components from point clouds. The points belonging to the scaffolding components are identified and separated from the main building structures and two basic elements, namely the toeboard and the tube, are reconstructed. The workflow has four main processing steps. Firstly, the raw point clouds are preprocessed by statistical filtering and voxel girding. In the second step, the planar surfaces of the building surface and scaffoldings are extracted via RANSAC and then grouped by their parallelity and distance to separate the building facade. In the third step, the 3D shape descriptor FPFH and random forest classification algorithm are applied to classify the point data of building facades into classes belonging to different elements. Finally, by the use of linear fitting algorithm and matching using SHOT shape descriptor, the tubes and toeboards are reconstructed with their geometric parameters. It is shown that the points belonging to these objects are identified and then reconstructed with cylinder and cuboid models. The final results show that over 60% of the tubes and nearly 90% of the toeboards are reconstructed in the investigated facade, and more than 40% of the reconstructed objects are well rebuilt.\",\"The accurate classification of architectural styles is of great significance to the study of architectural culture and human historical civilization. Models based on convolutional neural network (CNN) have achieved highly competitive results in the field of architectural style classification owing to its more powerful capability of feature expression. However, most of the CNN models to date only extract the global features of architecture facade or focus on some regions of architecture and fail to extract the spatial features of different components. To improve the accuracy of architectural style classification, we propose an architectural style classification method based on CNN and channel-spatial attention. Firstly, we add a preprocessing operation before CNN feature extraction to select main building candidate region in architectural image and then use CNN feature extractor for deep feature extraction. Secondly, channel-spatial attention module is introduced to generate an attention map, which can not only enhance the texture feature representation of architectural images but also focus on the spatial features of different architectural elements. Finally, the Softmax classifier is used to predict the score of the target class. The experimental results on the Architectural Style Dataset and AHE_Dataset have achieved satisfactory performance.\",\"We propose a novel method for recognition of structured images and demonstrate it on detection of windows in facade images. Given an ability to obtain local low-level data evidence on primitive elements of a structure (like window in a facade image), we determine their most probable number, attribute values (location, size) and neighborhood relation. The embedded structure is weakly modeled by pair-wise attribute constraints, which allow structure and attribute constraints to mutually support each other. We use a very general framework of reversible jump MCMC, which allows simple implementation of a specific structure model and plug-in of almost arbitrary element classifiers. The MC controls the classifier by prescribing it where to look, without wasting too much time on unpromising locations. We have chosen the domain of window recognition in facade images to demonstrate that the result is an efficient algorithm achieving performance of other strongly informed methods for regular structures like grids, while our general model covers loosely regular configurations as well.\",\"Land typology classification is one of the main challenges of Land Registries all around the world. This process has historically been carried out by hand, requiring a large workforce and long processing times. Satellite imagery is shaking up the information retrieval methods for rural areas, where automatic algorithms have also been developed for land categorisation, but never for urban areas. This study provides an algorithm which can potentially speed up the decision-making process, reduce and detect biases; by automatically classifying images of houses facades into land registry categories. Convolutional Neural Networks are combined with a SVM and trained with over 5,000 labelled images. Success rate is above 85% and single image processing time is of the order of milliseconds. Results make it possible to reduce operating costs and to improve the classification performance by taking the human factor out of the equation.\",\"Nowadays, with the development of the urban areas, the automatic reconstruction of the buildings, as an important objects of the city complex structures, became a challenging topic in computer vision and photogrammetric researches. In this paper, the capability of multi-view Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) images is examined to provide a 3D model of complex building facades using an efficient image-based modelling workflow. The main steps of this work include: pose estimation, point cloud generation, and 3D modelling. After improving the initial values of interior and exterior parameters at first step, an efficient image matching technique such as Semi Global Matching (SGM) is applied on UAV images and a dense point cloud is generated. Then, a mesh model of points is calculated using Delaunay 2.5D triangulation and refined to obtain an accurate model of building. Finally, a texture is assigned to mesh in order to create a realistic 3D model. The resulting model has provided enough details of building based on visual assessment.\",\"Energy consumption simulation and renovation of existing buildings require accurate acquisition of building facade features which mostly relies on time-consuming manual calculations based on architectural drawings. In this article, we proposed an automated deep learning-based approach based on the SE module and BiFPN to achieve precise and efficient facade feature extraction. The approach eliminated the image distortion of building facades and then enabled accurate segmentation of windows and accessory structures even under the situation of occlusion and reflection. The improved SOLOv2 algorithm resulted in a high mean average precision of 93% for window segmentation, leading to a more precise window-to-wall ratio estimation with a mean absolute error of 2.9% than the experts' estimation and existing deep learning-based methods. Considering the accurate results of facade parsing, our method can be utilized for city-level building feature extraction, providing theoretical and practical references for urban building energy simulation, urban renewal, and building health examination.\",\"Abandoned houses (AH) are focal points in urban communities by threatening local security, destroying housing markets, and burdening government finance in the U.S. legacy cities. In particular, individual-level AH detection provides essential information for fine-resolution urban studies, government decision-makers, and private sector practitioners. However, three primary conventional data sources (field data, utility data, and remote sensing data) cannot suffice to collect such fine-resolution data in the large spatial area via a cost-effective approach. To this end, Google Street View (GSV) imagery, which emerges as the mainstream open-access data source with global coverage, provides an opportunity to address this issue. Subsequently, a follow-up challenge confronting the detection of AH arises from the fact that it lacks an effective method that can discern authentic visual features from the redundant noise in GSV images. In this study, we aim to develop an effective method to detect individual-level AH from GSV imagery. Specifically, we developed a new hierarchical deep learning method to leverage both global and local visual features of AH in the detection. The method can be further divided into three steps: (1) Scene-based classification that can extract global visual features of AH was implemented through fine-tuning a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model. (2) We developed a patch-based classification method that can extract specific local features of AH. In this method, patches were generated from GSV images based on auto-detected local features, followed by being labeled as three categories: building patches, vegetation patches, and others. Two deep CNN models were employed to identify deteriorated building facade patches and overgrown vegetation patches, respectively. (3) Individual-level AH were detected by integrating scene classification results and patch classification results in a decision-tree model. Experimental results showed that the F-score of AH was 0.84 in a well-prepared dataset collected from five different Rust Belt cities. The proposed hierarchical deep learning approach effectively improved the accuracy comparing with the traditional scene-based method. In addition, the proposed method was applied to generate an AH map in a new site in Detroit, MI. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of GSV imagery in AH detection and showed great potential to detect AH in a large spatial extent.\",\"This paper describes a pipeline for automatically generating level of detail (LOD) models (digital twins), specifically LOD2 and LOD3, from free-standing buildings. Our approach combines structure from motion (SfM) with deep-learning-based segmentation techniques. Given multiple-view images of a building, we compute a three-dimensional (3D) planar abstraction (LOD2 model) of its point cloud using SfM techniques. To obtain LOD3 models, we use deep learning to perform semantic segmentation of the openings in the two-dimensional (2D) images. Unlike existing approaches, we do not rely on complex input, pre-defined 3D shapes or manual intervention. To demonstrate the robustness of our method, we show that it can generate 3D building shapes from a collection of building images with no further input. For evaluating reconstructions, we also propose two novel metrics. The first is a Euclidean-distance-based correlation of the 3D building model with the point cloud. The second involves re-projecting 3D model facades onto source photos to determine dice scores with respect to the ground-truth masks. Finally, we make the code, the image datasets, SfM outputs, and digital twins reported in this work publicly available in github.com\\u002feesd-epfl\\u002fLOD3_buildings and doi.org\\u002f10.5281\\u002fzenodo.6651663. With this work we aim to contribute research in applications such as construction management, city planning, and mechanical analysis, among others.\",\"Existing image inpainting algorithms have achieved good results in regular mask inpainting tasks, but there are still many limitations for irregular mask, and the inpainting results lack edge consistency and semantic correctness. To address these problems, we designed a progressive generative adversarial network in this paper. The generative network mainly contains a progressive feature generation module and an adaptive consistent attention module, and the discriminator network uses SN-PatchGAN. The network performs recursive inpainting from the edge to the centre, and the repaired features are used as the conditions for the next feature generation, which makes the constraints of the central content gradually strengthened. In order to obtain distant information from the feature maps as well as to consider the possible problem of inconsistency between feature mappings under different recursions when using attention directly in the progressive inpainting network, we designed an adaptive consistent attention module in this paper, which can adaptively combine scores obtained from different recursions to capture more feature information. The discriminator used in this paper is SN-PatchGAN, which directly calculates the hinge loss of each point on the output graph and can focus on different locations as well as different semantics. Comparing this paper's method on CelebA dataset and CMP Facade dataset with the latest work, the experimental results show that this paper's method performs well in the irregular mask image inpainting task, and the inpainting results have better performance in terms of edge consistency, semantic correctness, and overall image structure.\",\"Building recognition in urban environments aims to identify different buildings in a large-scale image dataset. This identification facilitates the annotation of any visual object to a building's facade and is an essential step in a variety of applications, such as automatic target detection in surveillance, real-time robot localization and visual navigation, architectural design, and 3D city reconstruction. Because of its importance, a significant number of building recognition systems have been proposed in recent years. Nevertheless, there is no systematic survey of building recognition in urban environments yet. To this end, we present a comprehensive review of the dominant building recognition systems by first grouping them into two categories: (i) effectiveness approaches that mainly focus on the improvement of recognition performance and (ii) efficiency methods that attempt to enhance the recognition speed. Effectiveness approaches are further categorized into two different groups: (i) feature representation-based algorithms and (ii) wide baseline matching-based methods. Efficiency methods are divided into: (i) dimensionality reduction-based methods and (ii) clustering-based algorithms. We provide analysis and discussions on each type of method and summarize their, advantages and weaknesses in depth. Furthermore, we outline future research directions and associated challenges in this promising area. This survey can serve as a starting point for new researchers in building recognition to generate new ideas according to their specific requirements. \",\"Extracting facade maps from 3D point clouds is a fast and economical way to describe a building's surface structure. Existing methods lack efficiency, robustness, and accuracy, and depend on many additional features such as point cloud reflectivity and color. This paper proposes a robust and automatic method to extract building facade maps. First, an improved 3D Hough transform is proposed by adding shift vote and 3D convolution of the accumulator to improve computational efficiency and reduce peak fuzziness and dependence on the step selection. These modifications make the extraction of potential planes fast and accurate. Second, the coplane and vertical plane constraints are introduced to eliminate pseudoplanes and nonbuilding facades. Then, we propose a strategy to refine the potential facade and to achieve the accurate calibration and division of the adjacent facade boundaries by clustering the refined point clouds of the facade. This process solves the problem where adjoining surfaces are merged into the same surface in the traditional method. Finally, the extracted facade point clouds are converted into feature images. Doors, windows, and building edges are accurately extracted via deep learning and digital image processing techniques, which combine to achieve accurate extraction of building facades. The proposed method was tested on the MLS and TLS point cloud datasets, which were collected from different cities with different building styles. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method decreases computational burden, improves efficiency, and achieves the accurate differentiation of adjacent facade boundaries with higher accuracy compared with the traditional method, verifying the robustness of the method. Additionally, the proposed method uses only point cloud geometry information, effectively reducing data requirements and acquisition costs.\",\"Creating a virtual city is demanded for computer games, movies, and urban planning, but it takes a lot of time to create numerous 3D building models. Procedural modeling has become popular in recent years to overcome this issue, but creating a grammar to get a desired output is difficult and time consuming even for expert users. In this paper, we present an interactive tool that allows users to automatically generate such a grammar from a single image of a building. The user selects a photograph and highlights the silhouette of the target building as input to our method. Our pipeline automatically generates the building components, from large-scale building mass to fine-scale windows and doors geometry. Each stage of our pipeline combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and optimization to select and parameterize procedural grammars that reproduce the building elements of the picture. In the first stage, our method jointly estimates camera parameters and building mass shape. Once known, the building mass enables the rectification of the facades, which are given as input to the second stage that recovers the facade layout. This layout allows us to extract individual windows and doors that are subsequently fed to the last stage of the pipeline that selects procedural grammars for windows and doors. Finally, the grammars are combined to generate a complete procedural building as output. We devise a common methodology to make each stage of this pipeline tractable. This methodology consists in simplifying the input image to match the visual appearance of synthetic training data, and in using optimization to refine the parameters estimated by CNNs. We used our method to generate a variety of procedural models of buildings from existing photographs.\",\"Automatic object removal with obstructed facades completion in the urban environment is essential for many applications such as scene restoration, environmental impact assessment, and urban mapping. However, the previous object removal typically requires a user to manually create a mask around unwanted objects and obtain background facade information in advance, which would be labor-intensive when implementing multitasking projects. Moreover, accurately detecting objects to be removed in the cityscape and inpainting the static obstructed building facade to obtain plausible images are the main challenges for this objective. To overcome these difficulties, this study addresses the object removal with the facade inpainting problem from the following two aspects. First, we proposed an image-based cityscape elimination method for automatic object removal and facade inpainting by applying semantic segmentation to detect several classes, including pedestrians, riders, vegetation, and cars, as well as using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for filling detected regions by background textures and patching information from street-level imagery. Second, we proposed a workflow to filter unoccluded building facades from street view images automatically and tailored a dataset for the GAN-based image inpainting model with original and mask images. Furthermore, several full-reference image quality assessment (IQA) metrics are introduced to evaluate the generated image quality. Validation results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed method, and the synthetic image is visually realistic and semantically consistent.\",\"With the development of society and the economy, the unified planning of architectural styles has become a significant problem in the balance between urban expansion and the protection of traditional buildings in villages and towns. This also allows people to re-examine the appearance of and quality of life, experienced by those in traditional village buildings. This research employs a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to develop a generative technique for designing building facades in villages and cities. The provided results can be used to develop schemes and as design references for building facade design, enhancing the design efficiency of building facades. Simultaneously, we utilized this model for the rehabilitation of building facades in villages and towns, as well as in the visual design of rural tourism products, demonstrating its practical usefulness and design-related potential. We took villages and towns in the Wuyishan area of China as an example and carried out model training, image generation, and a comparison of the derivation results of different assumed buildings and product contours. The research shows that: (1) CGAN can be used to produce and supply reference schemes for conventional civil construction facade design in rural and urban areas. (2) In terms of adaptability, CGAN may develop architectural facade design schemes with a reference value for the hypothetical experimental building facades, and it can play a role in other design domains, as well. (3) The construction of this method is not only applicable to villages and towns in the World Heritage es Cities Programme, but can be further promoted and used in the future for cities and villages that have a demand for architectural style consistency.\",\"This paper deals with the task of semantic segmentation, which aims to provide a complete description of an image by inferring a pixelwise labeling. While pixelwise classification is a suitable approach to achieve this goal, state-of-the-art kernel methods are generally not applicable since training and testing phase involve large amounts of data. We address this problem by presenting a method for large-scale inference with Gaussian processes. Standard limitations of Gaussian process classifiers in terms of speed and memory are overcome by pre-clustering the data using decision trees. This leads to a breakdown of the entire problem into several independent classification tasks whose complexity is controlled by the maximum number of training examples allowed in the tree leaves. We additionally propose a technique which allows for computing multi-class probabilities by incorporating uncertainties of the classifier estimates. The approach provides pixelwise semantics for a wide range of applications and different image types such as those from scene understanding, defect localization, and remote sensing. Our experiments are performed with a facade recognition application that shows the significant performance gain achieved by our method compared to previous approaches.\",\"Building usage maps are inputs in various urban applications. Although Street View Images (SVIs) are applied in many studies, their usage in the generation of building usage maps is limited. Further, their application to Indian cities remains void. This research aims to fill the discussed gaps by employing geotagged SVIs through web scraping, Google Street View (GSV), and manual collection. Manually collected data from mobile phone and web-scraped images also cover the dense regions, which are generally not covered in GSV. Hence, it helps the generation of accurate maps. We first applied a pretrained Inception-ResNet-v2 model to detect the building instances from training images of various Indian cities. The extracted building instances were manually labeled as different usage class (residential, commercial, industrial, and others) to develop the classification training set. EfficientNet-B7, a Deep Learning (DL) model leveraged the facade features in the training process to predict the usage class of the building instances. The model achieved an accuracy of 81% on training and 77% on test sets. The predictions were attributed with building footprint using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to prepare building usage maps for various cities in India. Although the model faced challenges in predicting a lot of buildings with similar facade, we still found it to be robust in predicting the usage of buildings across various geography. The study can act as a decision-making tool in various smart applications that require high-resolution building-use data, which can help developing sustainable cities.\",\"Using ground-based, remote hyperspectral images from 0.4-1.0 micron in similar to 850 spectral channels-acquired with the Urban Observatory facility in New York City-we evaluate the use of one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for pixel-level classification and segmentation of built and natural materials in urban environments. We find that a multi-class model trained on hand-labeled pixels containing Sky, Clouds, Vegetation, Water, Building facades, Windows, Roads, Cars, and Metal structures yields an accuracy of 90-97% for three different scenes. We assess the transferability of this model by training on one scene and testing to another with significantly different illumination conditions and\\u002for different content. This results in a significant (similar to 45%) decrease in the model precision and recall as does training on all scenes at once and testing on the individual scenes. These results suggest that while CNNs are powerful tools for pixel-level classification of very high-resolution spectral data of urban environments, retraining between scenes may be necessary. Furthermore, we test the dependence of the model on several instrument- and data-specific parameters including reduced spectral resolution (down to 15 spectral channels) and number of available training instances. The results are strongly class-dependent; however, we find that the classification of natural materials is particularly robust, especially the Vegetation class with a precision and recall \\u003e94% for all scenes and model transfers and \\u003e90% with only a single training instance.\",\"Building reconstruction using high-resolution satellite-based synthetic SAR tomography (TomoSAR) is of great importance in urban planning and city modeling applications. However, since the imaging mode of SAR is side-by-side, the TomoSAR point cloud of a single orbit cannot achieve a complete observation of buildings. It is difficult for existing methods to extract the same features, as well as to use the overlap rate to achieve the alignment of the homologous TomoSAR point cloud and the cross-source TomoSAR point cloud. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust alignment method for TomoSAR point clouds in urban areas. First, noise points and outlier points are filtered by statistical filtering, and density of projection point (DoPP)-based projection is used to extract TomoSAR building point clouds and obtain the facade points for subsequent calculations based on density clustering. Subsequently, coarse alignment of source and target point clouds was performed using principal component analysis (PCA). Lastly, the rotation and translation coefficients were calculated using the angle of the normal vector of the opposite facade of the building and the distance of the outer end of the facade projection. The experimental results verify the feasibility and robustness of the proposed method. For the homologous TomoSAR point cloud, the experimental results show that the average rotation error of the proposed method was less than 0.1 degrees, and the average translation error was less than 0.25 m. The alignment accuracy of the cross-source TomoSAR point cloud was evaluated for the defined angle and distance, whose values were less than 0.2 degrees and 0.25 m.\",\"Land-use classification based on spaceborne or aerial remote sensing images has been extensively studied over the past decades. Such classification is usually a patch-wise or pixel-wise labeling over the whole image. But for many applications, such as urban population density mapping or urban utility planning, a classification map based on individual buildings is much more informative. However, such semantic classification still poses some fundamental challenges, for example, how to retrieve fine boundaries of individual buildings. In this paper, we proposed a general framework for classifying the functionality of individual buildings. The proposed method is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which classify facade structures from street view images, such as Google Street View, in addition to remote sensing images which usually only show roof structures. Geographic information was utilized to mask out individual buildings, and to associate the corresponding street view images. We created a benchmark dataset which was used for training and evaluating CNNs. In addition, the method was applied to generate building classification maps on both region and city scales of several cities in Canada and the US.\",\"The objective of this work is a robust and highly efficient method for reconstruction and classification of facade parts in 3D point clouds. The presented top-down method is based on knowledge derived from a database of ground truth parameters. The usage of prior information is the key feature of our concept. It enables a robust and quick computation that even copes with a high percentage of outliers. Model knowledge is encoded in probability density functions. Furthermore, we combine random sampling with a novel scoring function that rates the size of predictions. Decision trees were applied to identify the most evident features that are assessed by the scoring function. Finally, cluster analysis is employed to estimate those borders of the respective object that cannot be identified precisely by the parametric model. Since the reconstruction of geometric models from a 3D point cloud is close to its classification, both problems are linked up by the presented concept. Our method works on non-oriented point clouds and is free of user interaction. The concept is delineated and demonstrated by the reconstruction of windows and stairs.\",\"Windows, as key components of building facades, have received increasing attention in facade parsing. Convolutional neural networks have shown promising results in window extraction. Most existing methods segment a facade into semantic categories and subsequently employ regularization based on the structure of manmade architectures. These methods merely concern the optimization of individual windows, without considering the spatial areas or relationships of windows. This paper presents a novel windows instance segmentation method based on Mask R-CNN architecture. The method features a spatial attention region proposal network and a relation module-enhanced head network. First, an attention module is introduced in the region proposal network to generate a spatial attention map, then the attention map is multiplied with the objectness scores of the classification branch. Second, for the head network, relation modules are added to model the spatial relationships between proposals. Appearance and geometric features are combined for instance recognition. Furthermore, we constructed a new window instance segmentation dataset with 1200 annotated images. With our dataset, the average precisions of our method on detection and segmentation increased from 53.1% and 53.7% to 56.4% and 56.7% compared with Mask R-CNN. A comparison with state-of-the-art methods also proves the predominance of our proposed method.\",\"Building facade detection is an important problem in computer vision, with applications in mobile robotics and semantic scene understanding. In particular, mobile platform localization and guidance in urban environments can be enabled with an accurate segmentation of the various building facades in a scene. Toward that end, we present a system for segmenting and labeling an input image that for each pixel, seeks to answer the question Is this pixel part of a building facade, and if so, which one? The proposed method determines a set of candidate planes by sampling and clustering points from the image with Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), using local normal estimates derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to inform the planar model. The corresponding disparity map and a discriminative classification provide prior information for a two-layer Markov Random Field model. This MRF problem is solved via Graph Cuts to obtain a labeling of building facade pixels at the mid-level, and a segmentation of those pixels into particular planes at the high-level. The results indicate a strong improvement in the accuracy of the binary building detection problem over the discriminative classifier alone, and the planar surface estimates provide a good approximation to the ground truth planes.\",\"In recent years, advances in computer hardware, graphics rendering algorithms and computer vision have enabled the utilization of 3D building reconstructions in the fields of archeological structure restoration and urban planning. This paper deals with the reconstruction of realistic 3D models of buildings facades, in the urban environment for cultural heritage. The proposed approach is an extension of our previous work in this research topic, which introduced a methodology for accurate 3D realistic facade reconstruction by defining and exploiting a relation between stereoscopic image and tacheometry data. In this work, we re-purpose well known deep neural network architectures in the fields of image segmentation and single image depth prediction, for the tasks of facade structural element detection, depth point-cloud generation and protrusion estimation, with the goal of alleviating drawbacks in our previous design, resulting in a more light-weight, robust, flexible and cost-effective design.\",\"Buildings account for 40% of the energy consumption and 13% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the U.S. To improve building energy efficiency, cities around the U.S. issued energy policies, such as the energy performance disclosure requirement in New York City, to encourage building owners to make informed retrofitting decisions. However, complying with these policies is expensive and time-consuming for government agencies and building owners, especially for old buildings where detailed building information is not readily available. In this work, we propose an automatic, non-intrusive, and scalable framework to capture energy-essential building variables through reasoning building facade images -FacadeReasoner. Specifically, we first build a comprehensive building information dataset and identify the most impactful (i.e., principal) variables in relation to building energy performance and GHG emissions using the state-of-the-art feature attribution model. Next, we propose a method to automatically collect an urban scale building image dataset with more than 10,000 facade images and extract principal-building-variables from these images using deep transfer learning. Results show that FacadeReasoner has the capability to predict principal building variables, namely building type (accuracy 0.77), year built (accuracy 0.62), building height (R2 0.80), and rough estimates of building area (R2 0.46) from facade images. This study is unique as it marks the first attempt to enable an automated end-to-end framework for urban scale principal-building-variables extraction, providing an efficient and economical alternative for large building portfolio owners and managers (e.g., municipalities) to comprehend urban scale energy-related building information for informed decision-making, directly contributing to Net-Zero 2050.\",\"There is a huge gap between the conceptual design and the practical implementation of the conservation planning of traditional architecture and settlement in China. The major cause is the diversity of individual comprehension. In this study, a generative design method was developed to regenerate the facades. The proposed method first adapted novel data acquisition and processing techniques to gather information and build the database. Cognition investigation and morphology analysis were then implemented to quantify and evaluate the features of historical characteristics. The knowledge discovery tools were further used to abstract the rules of the traditional facade. With the above three phases, the proposed method was able to generate the referable facades quantitatively and establishing generally accepted conservation plans and guidelines.\",\"Rephotography is the process of recapturing the photograph of a location from the same perspective in which it was captured earlier. A rephotographed image is the best presentation to visualize and study the social changes of a location over time. Traditionally, only expert artists and photographers are capable of generating the rephotograph of any specific location. Manual editing or human eye judgment that is considered for generating rephotographs normally requires a lot of precision, effort and is not always accurate. In the era of computer science and deep learning, computer vision techniques make it easier and faster to perform precise operations to an image. Until now many research methodologies have been proposed for rephotography but none of them is fully automatic. Some of these techniques require manual input by the user or need multiple images of the same location with 3D point cloud data while others are only suggestions to the user to perform rephotography. In historical records\\u002farchives most of the time we can find only one 2D image of a certain location. Computational rephotography is a challenge in the case of using only one image of a location captured at different timestamps because it is difficult to find the accurate perspective of a single 2D historical image. Moreover, in the case of building rephotography, it is required to maintain the alignments and regular shape. The features of a building may change over time and in most of the cases, it is not possible to use a features detection algorithm to detect the key features. In this research paper, we propose a methodology to rephotograph house images by combining deep learning and traditional computer vision techniques. The purpose of this research is to rephotograph an image of the past based on a single image. This research will be helpful not only for computer scientists but also for history and cultural heritage research scholars to study the social changes of a location during a specific time period, and it will allow users to go back in time to see how a specific place looked in the past. We have achieved good, fully automatic rephotographed results based on facade segmentation using only a single image.\",\"To solve the problems of blur, artifacts, and semantic inaccuracy of existing deep learning-based image inpainting algorithm when the large-area irregular defect area images are repaired, combining the U-NET architecture and the idea of a generative adversarial network, a generative image inpainting network based on the attention transfer cross layer mechanism is proposed. The network is divided into two parts: generator and discriminator; the generator proposes a attention transfer network cross layer based on the U-NET architecture; after the input image is encoded, the attention transfer network cross layer is used to reconstruct the encoding feature map of each layer. The decoding is performed by fusing the skip connection with the corresponding potential feature in the multi-scale decoder, solving the information loss between the codec network layers. Moreover, each decoding layer of the multi-scale decoder is prompted to generate consistent content, and finally the repaired image is obtained. After the decoding is completed, the decoding feature map of each layer is converted into a multi-scale RGB image, and the reconstruction L1 loss is applied on each scale; by minimizing the adversarial loss, the discriminator can determine the authenticity of the repaired image; the perceptual loss and style loss are introduced to judge the output image, so as to restrict the generator to generate more realistic and reasonable content. A qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis is performed on the Celeba, Facade, and Places2 with the current mainstream image inpainting algorithms. The results show that the repair results in this paper are better than others in terms of mean L1 loss, PSNR, and SSIM, and more in line with human visual characteristics. The attention transfer network cross layer proposed in this paper can effectively reconstruct the more detailed coding feature map, and it can play an active guiding role in the coding process by using skip connection; the image inpainting network can generate content that is highly consistent with the structure and semantics of the real image when repairing large-area irregular defect areas, which is more in line with the human visual experience.\",\"Feature extraction on facades from unstructured point clouds is a challenging work, especially in the presence of noise. Point cloud segmentation is one of the most important steps in this context. In this paper, a new approach for automatic processing of facade laser scanner data is introduced. Scanner orientation is partially known through the inclination sensors of the laser scanner used. Knowing these values allows us to reduce the point cloud data into a profile distribution function. After orientation, this distribution is a series of peaks and valleys suitable for segmentation. Each segmented layer is afterwards processed to find the facade contours. The results obtained prove that the approach may be successfully employed in building segmentation and extraction of planar features. Moreover, the accuracy of contours is very dependent on the resolution of the scan data. \",\"Surface normal estimation is an essential component of several computer and robot vision pipelines. While this problem has been extensively studied, most approaches are geared towards indoor scenes and often rely on multiple modalities (depth, multiple views) for accurate estimation of normal maps. Outdoor scenes pose a greater challenge as they exhibit significant lighting variation, often contain occluders, and structures like building facades are often ridden with numerous windows and protrusions. Conventional supervised learning schemes excel in indoor scenes, but do not exhibit competitive performance when trained and deployed in outdoor environments. Furthermore, they involve complex network architectures and require many more trainable parameters. To tackle these challenges, we present an adversarial learning scheme that regularizes the output normal maps from a neural network to appear more realistic, by using a small number of precisely annotated examples. Our method presents a lightweight and simpler architecture, while improving performance by at least 1.5x across most metrics. We evaluate our approaches against the state-of-the-art on normal map estimation, on a synthetic and a real outdoor dataset, and observe significant performance enhancements.\",\"3D reconstruction from single view is a very difficult problem in computer vision and computer graphics. Few works have been done in this area. In this paper, we proposed a method to discover structural regularity in single facade images on the procedural modeling of buildings by using SIFT algorithm. Firstly, symmetry information is detected from the image using SIFT algorithm for image analysis. Next, the symmetry information will be removed from the facade image. Finally, get the SIFT feature of widows and doors. Experiments show that our method can successfully discover regular structures with a higher recognition rate than existing method especially amidst shadowing and the changing illumination environment.\",\"Distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) harvesting is an effective way to collect solar energy in existing metropoli-tan cities. To facilitate the installation of PV modules at solar abundant locations, an accurate estimation of solar PV spatial potential is indispensable. Solar energy could be reflected on high-albedo building surfaces inside the urban canyon. However, using conventional ways to construct albedo datasets for different building surfaces is extremely labor-intense. In this work, we proposed to use semantic segmentation to identify facade materials from street view images. Due to the distinguishable features between materials in terms of the subtle texture and patterns rather than just their shapes and colors, identification requires more details from images, which makes multi-scale inference structure a promising solution. Compared with existing methods combining scales features at pixel-level, we proposed a novel Multi-Scale Contextual Attention Network (MSCA), using a Multi-Scale Object-Contextual Representation (OCR) block to exploit and combine contextual information from different scales in high dimensional layers. The experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing models, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIOU) of 70.23%. The results indicate that the MSCA can effectively obtain the materials information from street views and can be a reliable solution to providing urban albedo information for solar estimation.\",\"Due to high point density, accuracy and cost-effectiveness, Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) do have the great advantage of providing the details of building facade as required for the production of realistic 3D city models. Thus, a significant amount of research efforts has been directed towards reconstructing building facade models using TLS data. Most of reconstruction strategies are based on geometric feature extraction, which is categorized into two groups: point-based and segmentation-based boundary extraction. However, little attention was paid on further recognizing and separating those extracted geometric features, result of which is helpful for 3D building modeling at LOD3. This paper presents an approach to recognize 3D facade features automatically from TSL data based on heuristic knowledge of geometrical and topological configuration of facade objects. All the facade knowledge is stored in a hierarchical tree, which guides the classification process. Finally, a confusion matrix is created to evaluate the classification performance.\",\"Urban environments are regions in which spectral variability and spatial variability are extremely high, with a huge range of shapes and sizes, and they also demand high resolution images for applications involving their study. Due to the fact that these environments can grow even more over time, applications related to their monitoring tend to turn to autonomous intelligent systems, which together with remote sensing data could help or even predict daily life situations. The task of mapping cities by autonomous operators was usually carried out by aerial optical images due to its scale and resolution; however new scientific questions have arisen, and this has led research into a new era of highly-detailed data extraction. For many years, using artificial neural models to solve complex problems such as automatic image classification was commonplace, owing much of their popularity to their ability to adapt to complex situations without needing human intervention. In spite of that, their popularity declined in the mid-2000s, mostly due to the complex and time-consuming nature of their methods and workflows. However, newer neural network architectures have brought back the interest in their application for autonomous classifiers, especially for image classification purposes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been a trend for pixel-wise image segmentation, showing flexibility when detecting and classifying any kind of object, even in situations where humans failed to perceive differences, such as in city scenarios. In this paper, we aim to explore and experiment with state-of-the-art technologies to semantically label 3D urban models over complex scenarios. To achieve these goals, we split the problem into two main processing lines: first, how to correctly label the facade features in the 2D domain, where a supervised CNN is used to segment ground-based facade images into six feature classes, roof, window, wall, door, balcony and shop; second, a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) workflow is used to extract the geometry of the facade, wherein the segmented images in the previous stage are then used to label the generated mesh by a reverse ray-tracing technique. This paper demonstrates that the proposed methodology is robust in complex scenarios. The facade feature inferences have reached up to 93% accuracy over most of the datasets used. Although it still presents some deficiencies in unknown architectural styles and needs some improvements to be made regarding 3D-labeling, we present a consistent and simple methodology to handle the problem.\",\"Building facades elements detection plays a key point role in facade defects detection and street scene recon-struction tasks for sustainable city development. Although the artificial intelligence technology has made a breakthrough in image segmentation, it is nontrivial to directly apply standard deep learning approaches for building facade element detection. The main reason is that the existing semantic segmentation networks have a bad performance in predicting highly regularized shapes. This research develops a hieratical deep learning framework with a symmetric loss function to automatically detect building facade elements from images. The new framework contains two types of attention modules, namely, the spatial attention module, and the channel attention module. A new loss function is designed to integrate prior engineering knowledge, which can be used to force the detection of facade elements (e.g., windows, doors, concrete walls, and sunshades) to have a highly proportionate shape. The effectiveness of the developed approach is demonstrated in two public datasets. Experimental results indicate that the developed deep learning framework with a new loss function outperforms state-of-the-art models significantly, where the achieved a Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) on the Ecole Centrale Paris(ECP) dataset (81.9%) brings an improvement of 11.3% over Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and 4.0% over Deepfacade, respectively, and the achieved a Mean IoU on the ArtDeco dataset (85.6%) yields an improvement of 11.4% over FCN and 5.8% over Deepfacade, respectively. Moreover, the developed approach is more practical and effective to detect regularized facade elements, where the detection of the wall components has an IoU of 93.6% on the ECP dataset and 88.6% on the ArtDeco dataset, respectively. Overall, the contribution from the technical aspect is to develop a hieratical deep learning framework consisting of attention modules together with the newly designed loss function and the prior engineering knowledge. The contribution from the practical aspect is to realize the automatic and accurate detection for various building facade elements in complex environments, which can be potentially helpful for the infrastructure monitoring and maintenance operation.\",\"In this paper, we use shape grammars (SGs) for facade parsing, which amounts to segmenting 2D building facades into balconies, walls, windows, and doors in an architecturally meaningful manner. The main thrust of our work is the introduction of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to deal with the computational complexity of the problem. RL provides us with techniques such as Q-learning and state aggregation which we exploit to efficiently solve facade parsing. We initially phrase the 1D parsing problem in terms of a Markov Decision Process, paving the way for the application of RL-based tools. We then develop novel techniques for the 2D shape parsing problem that take into account the specificities of the facade parsing problem. Specifically, we use state aggregation to enforce the symmetry of facade floors and demonstrate how to use RL to exploit bottom-up, image-based guidance during optimization. We provide systematic results on the Paris building dataset and obtain state-of-the-art results in a fraction of the time required by previous methods. We validate our method under diverse imaging conditions and make our software and results available online.\",\"Advances in three-dimensional (3D) acquisition systems have introduced this technology to more fields of study, such as archaeology or architecture. In the architectural field, scanning a building is one of the first possible steps from which a 3D model can be obtained and can be later used for visualisation and\\u002for feature analysis, thanks to computer-based pattern recognition tools. The automation of these tools allows for temporal savings and has become a strong aid for professionals, so that more and more methods are developed with this objective. In this article, a method for 3D mesh segmentation focused on the representation of historic buildings is proposed. This type of buildings is characterised by having singularities and features in facades, such as doors or windows. The main objective is to recognise these features, understanding them as those parts of the model that differ from the main structure of the building. The idea is to use a recognition algorithm for planar faces that allows users to create a graph showing the connectivity between them, therefore allowing the reflection of the shape of the 3D model. At a later step, this graph is matched against some pre-defined graphs that represent the patterns to look for. Each coincidence between both graphs indicate the position of one of the characteristics sought. The developed method has proved to be effective for feature detection and suitable for inclusion in architectural surveying applications.\",\"This study proposes a method to recognize facades from large-scale urban scenes based on multi-level image features utilizing a recently developed oblique aerial photogrammetry technique. The method involves the use of multi-level image features, a bottom-up feature extraction procedure to produce regions of interest through monoscopic analysis, and then a coarse-to-fine feature matching strategy to characterise and match the regions in a stereoscopic model. Feature extraction from typical urban Manhattan scenes is based on line segments. Windows are re-organised based on the spatial constraints of line segments and the homogeneous structure of the spectrum. Facades as regions of interest are successfully constructed with a remarkable single edge and evidence from windows to get rid of occlusion. Feature matching is hierarchically performed beginning from distinctive facades and regularly distributed windows to the sub-pixel point primitives. The proposed strategy can effectively solve ambiguity and multi-solution problems in the complex urban scene matching process, particularly repetitive and poor-texture facades in oblique view.\",\"Although the Korean government has provided high-quality architectural building information for a long period of time, its focus on administrative details over three-dimensional (3D) architectural mapping and data collection has hindered progress. This study presents a basic method for extracting exterior building information for the purpose of 3D mapping using deep learning and digital image processing. The method identifies and classifies objects by using the fast regional convolutional neural network model. The results show an accuracy of 93% in the detection of facade and 91% window detection; this could be further improved by more clearly defining the boundaries of windows and reducing data noise. The additional metadata provided by the proposed method could, in the future, be included in building information modeling databases to facilitate structural analyses or reconstruction efforts.\",\"The automatic interpretation of 3D point clouds for building reconstruction is a challenging task. The interpretation process requires highly structured models representing semantics. Formal grammars can describe structures as well as the parameters of buildings and their parts. We propose a novel approach for the automatic learning of weighted attributed context-free grammar rules for 3D building reconstruction, supporting the laborious manual design of rules. We separate structure from parameter learning. Specific Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used to generate a weighted context-free grammar and predict structured outputs such as parse trees. The grammar is extended by parameters and constraints, which are learned based on a statistical relational learning method using Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). MLNs enforce the topological and geometric constraints. MLNs address uncertainty explicitly and provide probabilistic inference. They are able to deal with partial observations caused by occlusions. Uncertain projective geometry is used to deal with the uncertainty of the observations. Learning is based on a large building database covering different building styles and facade structures. In particular, a treebank that has been derived from the database is employed for structure learning.\",\"A major application area for Augmented Reality (AR) is advertisement. To achieve easy advertisement integration and management for stakeholders, a quantitative semantic understanding of the world, that adheres to human perception is necessary. Current deep learning-based segmentation algorithms such as Mask R-CNN provide a mask of the real world (e.g. building facades) in a greedy manner, which, although quantitatively accurate, does not adhere to the needs of the AR advertisers for appropriate ad placement, such as ad size, mask continuity, etc. In this paper, we propose three intuitive metrics for evaluating building facade segmentation specifically for advertisement integration, namely, average discontinuity, normalized continuous area, and resolution ratio. Each of these metrics is inspired from the way advertisers may want to view segmentation results within an AR world editor, or the way users may want to experience AR advertisements. Experimental results on a test segmentation shows the importance of such intuitive metrics, where we show how an accurate placement area for a sample 2D advertisement can be easily isolated from a segmented facade using our metrics.\",\"In the past few years, street-level geoviewers has become a. very popular web-application. In this paper, we focus on a, first urban concept which has been identified as useful for indexing then retrieving a building or a. location in a city: the windows. The work can be divided into three successive processes: first, object detection, then object characterization, finally similarity function design (kernel design). Contours seem intuitively relevant to hold architecture information from building facades. We first provide a robust window detector for our unconstrained data, present some results and compare our method with the reference one. Then; we represent objects by fragments of contours and a relational graph on these contour fragments. We design a kernel similarity function for structured sets of contours which will take into account the variations of contour orientation inside the structure set as well as spatial proximity. One difficulty to evaluate the relevance of our approach is that there is no reference database available. We made, thus, our own dataset. The results are quite encouraging regarding what; was expected and what provide methods the literature.\",\"As-built building information model (BIM) is an urgent need of the architecture, engineering, construction and facilities management (AEC\\u002fFM) community. However, its creation procedure is still labor-intensive and far from maturity. Taking advantage of prevalence of digital cameras and the development of advanced computer vision technology, the paper proposes to reconstruct a building facade and recognize its surface materials from images taken from various points of view. These can serve as initial steps towards automatic generation of as-built BIM. Specifically, 3D point clouds are generated from multiple images using structure from motion method and then segmented into planar components, which are further recognized as different structural components through knowledge based reasoning. Windows are detected through a multilayered complementary strategy by combining detection results from every semantic layer. A novel machine learning based 3D material recognition strategy is presented. Binary classifiers are trained through support vector machines. Material type at a given 3D location is predicted by all its corresponding 2D feature points. Experimental results from three existing buildings validate the proposed system.\",\"Semantic segmentation of building facade point clouds has diverse applications. The development of semantic segmentation methods is inextricably linked to datasets. The available building facade datasets suffer from a lack of abundant semantic categories and data completeness. To compensate for these shortcomings, we propose a new building facade dataset characterized by various categories and relatively complete 3-D building facades. In addition, most existing methods focus on fully supervised learning, which relies on manually labeling large-scale point cloud data and results in high time and labor costs. In this article, we propose an effective weakly supervised building facade segmentation approach, called spatial adaptive fusion consistency contrastive constraint (SAF-C3), to solve the above problem. We first design a multirandom point cloud augmentor as an auxiliary supervision branch to enhance the learning ability of the original network branch. Then, we present a spatial adaptive fusion (SAF) module to extract discriminative features for building facade point clouds. Finally, we propose a spatial consistency contrastive constraint to explore the contrastive property in feature space and to ensure the predictive consistency among the augmentation and original branches. The proposed method achieves a significant performance improvement against the state-of-the-art methods on two building facade point cloud datasets through extensive experiments. In particular, the performance of SAF-C3 with 1% labels significantly surpasses the baseline network with 100% labels.\",\"Architectural styles and their evolution are central to architecture history. However, traditional approaches to understand styles and their evolution require domain expertise, fieldwork and extensive manual processes. Recent research in deep learning and computer vision has highlighted the great potential in analyzing urban environments from images. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework for understanding architectural styles and age epochs by deciphering building facades based on street-level imagery. The frame-work is composed of two stages: Deep 'Learning' the architecture and Deep 'Interpreting' the architecture age epochs and styles. In Deep 'Learning', a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model is designed to automatically learn about the age characteristics of building facades from street view images. In Deep 'Inter-preting' stage, three components are proposed to understand the different perspectives regarding building ages and styles. In the experiment, a building age epoch dataset is compiled for the city of Amsterdam and Stockholm to understand the evolution of architectural element styles and the relationship between building ages and styles spatially and temporally. This research illustrates how publicly available data and deep learning could be used to trace the evolution of architectural styles in the spatial-temporal domain.\",\"Nowadays, multi-camera aerial platforms combining nadir and oblique cameras are experiencing a revival and several companies have proposed new image acquisition systems. Due to their various advantages, oblique imagery have found their place in numerous companies and civil applications. However, the automatic processing of such image blocks still remains a topic of research. Camera configuration indeed poses a challenge on the traditional photogrammetric pipeline used in commercial software but, on the other hand, gives the opportunity to exploit the additional information provided by the oblique views and allows a more reliable feature extraction. In particular, the information that can be provided in correspondence of building facades can open new possibilities for the building detection and footprint extraction. In this paper, a methodology for the automated extraction of building footprints from oblique imagery is presented. The extraction is performed using dense point clouds generated using an image matching algorithm. The developed methodology and the achieved results are described in detail showing the advantages and opportunities offered by oblique aerial systems for cartographic and mapping purposes.\",\"GAN has been widely applied in the research of architectural image generation. However, the quality and controllability of generated images, and the interpretability of model are still potential to be improved. In this paper, by implementing StyleGAN2 model, plausible building facade images could be generated without conditional input. In addition, by applying GANSpace to analysis the latent space, high-level properties could be controlled for both generated images and novel images outside of training set. At last, the generating and controlling process could be visualized with image embedding and PCA projection method, which could achieve unsupervised classification of generated images, and help to understand the correlation between the images and their latent vectors.\",\"Detecting building facade elements is a crucial problem in computer vision for image interpretation. In Building Information Modeling (BIM) studies, the detection of building facade elements has an important role. BIM is a tool that allows maintaining a digital representation of all aspects of building information; therefore, it will enable the storage of almost any data related to a given structure, regarding its geometric and non-geometric aspects. Facade segmentation was first studied in the 1970s using hand-crafted expertise. Later, detection and segmentation studies emerged based on shapes of objects and parametric rules. With the developing technology, deep learning approaches in object detection studies have intensified. It is obvious that the desired analyses can be performed faster with deep learning approaches. However, deep learning methods require large training data. Algorithms that consider different situations and are suitable for real-world scenarios continue to be developed. The need in this direction continues in the literature. In this study, door and window detection was carried out with deep learning on an original data set. The algorithms used are YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, and Faster R-CNN. Precision, recall and mean average precision (mAP) are used as evaluation metrics. As a result of the study, precision, recall, and mAP values with YOLOv5 were obtained as 0.85, 0.72, and 0.79, respectively. With Faster R-CNN with the lowest performance, precision, recall, and mAP were obtained as 0.54, 0.63, and 0.54, respectively.\",\"The purpose of the study presented here is to enrich low resolution (LODI) 3D city models with semantic information about the architectural style of buildings The focus is on identitying Wilhelminian style buildings - terraced houses with three to four floors, high storeys, richly decorated facades and an architectural style typical for the turn of the 20th century We use this example for the evaluation of the potential of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for data mining in 3D city models Identification of Wilhelminian style buildings with low level data is demanding since most distinguishing characteristics are on higher levels of de tail However, Wilhelminian style buildings tend to form specific ensembles of buildings with similar shape thus context information is significant After careful pre-processing feature extraction, and feature weighting, a Support Vector Machine with a radial basis function as kernel was trained In contract to other classifiers which minimize the em pineal Support Vector Machines are based on structural risk minimization This approach turned out to be especially useful for a task where the respective classes are highly inhomogeneous and a high percentage of the training data is mislabeled In order to reduce the effect of the latter an outlier detection was applied as part of the pre-processing Above, a clustering algorithm was used to cope with hidden structures in the training data Despite difficult boundary conditions the SVM classifier was able to detect Wilhelminian style houses with high accuracy This demonstrates the high potential of Support Vector Machines for data mining in 3D City Models However intelligent pre-processing and kernel parameter optimization are necessary\",\"In recent years, artificial intelligence technology has widely influenced the design field, introducing new ideas to efficiently and systematically solve urban renewal design problems. The purpose of this study is to create a stylized generation technology for building facade decoration in historic districts, which will aid in the design and control of district style and form. The goal is to use the technical advantages of the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) in image generation and style transfer to create a method for independently designing a specific facade decoration style by interpreting image data of historical district facades. The research in this paper is based on the historical district of Putian in Fujian Province and facilitates an experiment of image data acquisition, image processing and screening, model training, image generation, and style matching of the target area. The research found the following: (1) CGAN technology can better identify and generate the decorative style of historical districts. It can realize the overall or partial scheme design of the facade. (2) In terms of adaptability, this method can provide a better scheme reference for historical district reconstruction, facade renovation, and renovation design projects. Especially for districts with obvious decorative styles, the visualization effect is better. In addition, it also has certain reference significance for the determination and design of the facade decoration style of a specific historical building. (3) Lastly, this method can better learn the internal laws of the complex district style and form to generate a new design with a clear decoration style attribute. It can be extended to other fields of historical heritage protection to enhance practitioners' stylized control of the heritage environment and improve the efficiency and capability of professional design.\",\"Recently, performance improvement in facade parsing from 3D point clouds has been brought about by designing more complex network structures, which cost huge computing resources and do not take full advantage of prior knowledge of facade structure. Instead, from the perspective of data distribution, we construct a new hierarchical mesh multi-view data domain based on the characteristics of facade objects to achieve fusion of deep-learning models and prior knowledge, thereby significantly improving segmentation accuracy. We comprehensively evaluate the current mainstream method on the RueMonge 2014 data set and demonstrate the superiority of our method. The mean intersection-over-union index on the facade-parsing task reached 76.41%, which is 2.75% higher than the current best result. In addition, through comparative experiments, the reasons for the performance improvement of the proposed method are further analyzed.\",\"In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework, namely AFGL-Net to achieve building facade parsing, i.e., obtaining the semantics of small components of building facade, such as windows and doors. To this end, we present an autoencoder embedding position and direction encoding for local feature encoding. The autoencoder enhances the local feature aggregation and augments the representation of skeleton features of windows and doors. We also integrate the Transformer into AFGL-Net to infer the geometric shapes and structural arrangements of facade components and capture the global contextual features. These global features can help recognize inapparent windows\\u002fdoors from the facade points corrupted with noise, outliers, occlusions, and irregularities. The attention-based feature fusion mechanism is finally employed to obtain more informative features by simultaneously considering local geometric details and the global contexts. The proposed AFGL-Net is comprehensively evaluated on Dublin and RueMonge2014 benchmarks, achieving 67.02% and 59.80% mIoU, respectively. We also demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AFGL-Net by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods and various ablation studies.\",\"Land-use maps are important references for urban planning and urban studies. Given the heterogeneity of urban land-use types, it is difficult to differentiate different land-use types based on overhead remotely sensed data. Google Street View (GSV) images, which capture the facades of building blocks along streets, could be better used to judge the land-use types of different building blocks based on their facade appearances. Recently developed scene classification algorithms in computer vision community make it possible to categorize different photos semantically based on various image feature descriptors and machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a method to derive detailed land-use information at building block level based on scene classification algorithms and GSV images. Three image feature descriptors (i.e., scale-invariant feature transform-Fisher, histogram of oriented gradients, GIST) were used to represent GSV images of different buildings. Existing land-use maps were used to create training datasets to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for categorizing GSV images. The trained SVM classifiers were then applied to case study areas in New York City, Boston, and Houston, to predict the land-use information at building block level. Accuracy assessment results show that the proposed method is suitable for differentiating residential buildings and nonresidential buildings with an accuracy of 85% or so. Since the GSV images are publicly accessible, this proposed method would provide a new way for building block level land-use mapping in future.\",\"With the emergence of Generative Adversarial Networks, great progress has been made in image inpainting. However, most existing methods can produce plausible results, but fail to generate finer textures and structures. This is mainly due to the fact that (1) the generation of finer content in the masked region of an image is not constrained enough during network training, and (2) many different alternative pixels are exist to fill in the masked regions, making it very difficult for the inpainting network to generate reasonable sharp edges. To address these issues, we propose a Scale Enhanced GAN (SE-GAN) model which combines the constraints of large- and small-scale receptive fields of our tailor-made discriminators to achieve fine-grained constraint on image details, a novel edge loss to further ensure the sharpness of the generated image. Experiments on multiple datasets including faces(CelebA-HQ), textures(DTD), buildings(Facade) and natural images(ImageNet, Places2) show that our approach can generate higher quality inpainting results with more details than previous methods.\",\"The quality of the urban environment is crucial for societal well-being. Yet, measuring and tracking the quality of urban environment, their evolution, and spatial disparities is difficult due to the amount of on-the-ground data needed to capture these patterns. The growing availability of street view images presents new prospects in identifying urban features. However, the reliability and consistency of these methods across different locations and time remains largely unexplored. We aim to develop a comprehensive index of urban quality and change at the street segment level using Google Street View (GSV) imagery. We focus on eight object classes that indicate urban decay or contribute to an unsightly urban space, such as potholes, graffiti, garbage, tents, barred or broken windows, discolored or dilapidated facades, weeds, and utility markings. We train an object detection model on a dataset of images from different cities and assess the performance of these urban indices. We evaluate the effectiveness of this method in various urban contexts over time and discuss its potential for urban planning and public policy. We demonstrate the use of these indices in three applications: the Tenderloin in San Francisco, the Doctores and Historic Center neighborhoods in Mexico City, and South Bend, Indiana.\",\"Maintaining a public register by extracting urban objects from photos taken in the city is one of the most important tasks for municipal services. It is of great importance in the field of protection and shaping of the cultural landscape, protection of monuments, and registration of the urban tissue development. The current state of the art shows that deep learning models (DL models) can cope with the problem of extracting urban objects with the same or better performance than non-DL models, and can process video and photos automatically. This paper compares the three main DL models for facade instance detection and facade segmentation: Mask R-CNN, YOLACT, and Mask-Scoring R-CNN. The training and validation datasets used for transfer learning were created on the basis of spherical photos taken in an artificially generated virtual city. The test dataset, on the other hand, included spherical facade photos taken in a real city. The comparative analysis of the DL models was performed using parametric and nonparametric statistical tests for pairwise and multiple comparisons.\",\"Object removal and inpainting approaches typically require a user to manually create a mask around occluding objects. While creating masks for a small number of images is possible, it rapidly becomes untenable for longer image sequences. Instead, we accomplish this step automatically using an object detection framework to explicitly recognize and remove several classes of occlusions. We propose using this technique to improve 3D urban reconstruction from street level imagery, in which building facades are frequently occluded by vegetation or vehicles. By assuming facades in the background are planar, 3D scene estimation provides important context to the inpainting process by restricting input sample patches to regions that are coplanar to the occlusion, leading to more realistic final textures. Moreover, because non-static and reflective occlusion classes tend to be difficult to reconstruct, explicitly recognizing and removing them improves the resulting 3D scene.\",\"LiDAR is considered as an effective technology for digitizing the real scene at a very high-resolution and in a short time. However, the resolution of the LiDAR is not sufficient to identify and evaluate the facade surface features like edges and cracks. Generally, photographs provide a better interpretation of the linear characteristics. The complementary benefits of each allow exploring valuable spatial information with different surface detail levels. The paper introduces a flexible image-based approach for linear feature extraction from LiDAR point cloud. Initially, the algorithm converts the point clouds into a structured depth image to reduce the complexity and computation time. Using transformation matrix and camera calibration parameters, the visible point clouds are perceptively projected into color image space using co-linearity equations. The result depth channel is sampled with the interpolation process and added to the color channels to compute (RGBD) layers. The edges and linear features of the surface are initially extracted using the optical 2D imagery and subsequently, each pixel of the linear features can be projected directly into 3D space. Due to the various acquisition positions of the laser and color images, the issue of occlusion is resolved using the visibility algorithm. Applying the methodology, experimental results from the Treasury Monument of Jordan's ancient Petra City, indicate that the developed approach provides adequate contour points for better interpretation and quantification of weathering processes and dangerous cracking. 3D Modeling these features can also reduce data size, facilitating surface inspection and analysis with simpler models.\",\"With strong inference of hierarchical and repetitive structures, semantic information has been widely used in dealing with urban scenes. In this paper, we present a super-pixel-based facade parsing framework which combines the top-down shape grammar splitting with bottom-up information aggregation: machine learning forecasts prior classes, super-pixels improve compactness, and boundary estimation divides the splitting into two procedures raw and fine, providing a reasonable initial guess for the latter to achieve better random-walk optimization results. We also put forward the correlation judging between floors for the purpose of compromising freedom degree reduction with style variety and flexibility, which is also introduced as alignment constraint term to extend the probability energy. Experiments show that our method converges fast and achieves the state-of-the-art results for different styles. Further study on understanding and reconstruction is in progress of exploiting these results.\",\"Building facade detection is an important problem in computer vision, with applications in mobile robotics and semantic scene understanding. In particular, mobile platform localization and guidance in urban environments can be enabled with accurate models of the various building facades in a scene. Toward that end, we present a system for detection, segmentation, and parameter estimation of building facades in stereo imagery. The proposed method incorporates multilevel appearance and disparity features in a binary discriminative model, and generates a set of candidate planes by sampling and clustering points from the image with Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), using local normal estimates derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to inform the planar models. These two models are incorporated into a two-layer Markov Random Field (MRF): an appearance- and disparity-based discriminative classifier at the mid-level, and a geometric model to segment the building pixels into facades at the high-level. By using object-specific stereo features, our discriminative classifier is able to achieve substantially higher accuracy than standard boosting or modeling with only appearance-based features. Furthermore, the results of our MRF classification indicate a strong improvement in accuracy for the binary building detection problem and the labeled planar surface models provide a good approximation to the ground truth planes.\",\"We present a system to extract architectural assets from large-scale collections of panoramic imagery. We automatically rectify and crop parts of the panoramic image that contain dominant planes, and then use object detection to extract assets such as facades and windows. We also provide various tools to identify attributes of the assets to determine the asset quality and index the assets for search. In addition, we propose a User Interface (UI) to visualize and query assets. Finally, we present applications for urban modeling and texture synthesis.\",\"The Bukchon area in Seoul boasts a high density of Hanok, the traditional Korean architecture representing the region. Because the Hanok facade plays a vital role in the streetscape formation, we must record it in terms of social, cultural, historical, artistic, and scenic values. However, recording the facade of an existing Hanok building through drawing or image information is time consuming and labor intensive, and therefore costly. Further, its digital conversion is inherently difficult. This study proposes the use of deep learning to identify the form elements that comprise the Hanok facade. Three-dimensional modeling was performed on 405 well-preserved Hanok facades in the region, and 2808 items of image data were created under similar conditions and at differing angles. Labeling was performed on the shape elements of the Hanok facade, and a methodology was established to identify the facade elements using MASK R-CNN. The type of roof, windows, the lower part of the outer wall, and the design were identified with high accuracy.\",\"The urban built environment of contemporary cities confronts a constant risk of deterioration due to natural or artificial reasons. Especially political aggression and war conflicts have significant destructive effects on architectural and cultural heritage buildings. The post-war urbanscapes demonstrate the striking effects of the armed conflicts during the hot war encounters. However, the residues of the urbanscapes become the actual indicators of damage and loss. Since today we can make future predictions using a variety of machine learning algorithms, it is possible to represent hybrid projections of urban heterotopias. In this context, this research proposes to explore dystopian post-war projections for modern cities based on their architectural styles and demonstrate the utopian scenarios of rehabilitation possibilities for the damaged urban built environment of post-war cities by using generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithms. Two primary datasets containing the post-war and pre-war building facades have been given as the input data for the CycleGAN and pix2pix GAN models. Thus, two different image-to-image GAN models have been compared regarding their ability to produce legible building facade projections in architectural features. Besides, the machine learning process results have been discussed in terms of cities' utopian and dystopian future predictions, demonstrating the war conflicts' immense effects on the built environment. Moreover, the immediate consequence of the destructive aggression on tangible and intangible architectural heritage would become visible to inhabitants and policymakers when the AI-generated rehabilitation potentials have been exposed.\",\"The aim of this study is to investigate how children behave in the landscape of three Chinese residential quarters. Based on information collected through investigation using Principal Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis, the residential landscapes are classified into ten types, each of which can be generally described according to four spatial factors-exposure, proximity to water, accessibility, and relative building facade. The results show that: 1) playing is the most typical behaviour of children; 2) space with some degree of exposure has a more obvious effect on the distribution of children's behaviour, and most children prefer to play along the waterside; 3) children without independent action ability tend to play in a semi-open space with a safe and stable environment, while those with independent action ability choose their play space more freely; 4) integrated open space that can be easily accessed, has a waterfront landscape and is near a building facade, may significantly stimulate children's behaviour.\",\"Point clouds with ever-increasing volume are regular data in 3D city modelling, in which building reconstruction is a significant part. The photogrammetric point cloud, generated from UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) imagery, is a novel type of data in building reconstruction. Its positive characteristics, alongside its challenging qualities, provoke discussions on this theme of research. In this paper, patch-wise detection of the points of window frames on facades and roofs are undertaken using this kind of data. A density-based multi-scale filter is devised in the feature space of normal vectors to globally handle the matter of high volume of data and to detect edges. Color information is employed for the downsized data to remove the inner clutter of the building. Perceptual organization directs the approach via grouping and the Gestalt principles, to segment the filtered point cloud and to later detect window patches. The evaluation of the approach displays a completeness of 95% and 92%, respectively, as well as a correctness of 95% and 96%, respectively, for the detection of rectangular and partially curved window frames in two big heterogeneous cluttered datasets. Moreover, most intrusions and protrusions cannot mislead the window detection approach. Several doors with glass parts and a number of parallel parts of the scaffolding are mistaken as windows when using the large-scale object detection approach due to their similar patterns with window frames. Sensitivity analysis of the input parameters demonstrates that the filter functionality depends on the radius of density calculation in the feature space. Furthermore, successfully employing the Gestalt principles in the detection of window frames is influenced by the width determination of window partitioning.\",\"Repeated patterns (such as windows, balconies, and doors) are prominent and significant features in urban scenes. Therefore, detection of these repeated patterns becomes very important for city scene analysis. This paper attacks the problem of repeated pattern detection in a precise, efficient and automatic way, by combining traditional feature extraction with a Kronecker product based low-rank model. We introduced novel algorithms that extract repeated patterns from rectified images with solid theoretical support. Our method is tailored for 2D images of building facades and tested on a large set of facade images.\",\"Within the fields of urban reconstruction and city modeling, shape grammars have emerged as a powerful tool for both synthesizing novel designs and reconstructing buildings. Traditionally, a human expert was required to write grammars for specific building styles, which limited the scope of method applicability. We present an approach to automatically learn two-dimensional attributed stochastic context-free grammars (2D-ASCFGs) from a set of labeled building facades. To this end, we use Bayesian Model Merging, a technique originally developed in the field of natural language processing, which we extend to the domain of two-dimensional languages. Given a set of labeled positive examples, we induce a grammar which can be sampled to create novel instances of the same building style. In addition, we demonstrate that our learned grammar can be used for parsing existing facade imagery. Experiments conducted on the dataset of Haussmannian buildings in Paris show that our parsing with learned grammars not only outperforms bottom-up classifiers but is also on par with approaches that use a manually designed style grammar.\",\"Existing deep models for facade parsing often fail in classifying pixels in heavily occluded regions of facade images due to the difficulty in feature representation of these pixels. In this paper, we solve facade parsing with occlusions by progressive feature learning. To this end, we locate the regions contaminated by occlusions via Bayesian uncertainty evaluation on categorizing each pixel in these regions. Then, guided by the uncertainty, we propose an occlusion-immune facade parsing architecture in which we progressively re-express the features of pixels in each contaminated region from easy to hard. Specifically, the outside pixels, which have reliable context from visible areas, are re-expressed at early stages; the inner pixels are processed at late stages when their surroundings have been decontaminated at the earlier stages. In addition, at each stage, instead of using regular square convolution kernels, we design a context enhancement module (CEM) with directional strip kernels, which can aggregate structural context to re-express facade pixels. Extensive experiments on popular facade datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.\",\"In the remote sensing community, land-cover classification is usually performed on the top-view images. However, besides the top-view features (including elevation), facade captured by the oblique images is useful but severely underutilized in the land-cover classification. The facade information of an object, is by nature more variable, thus can be extremely useful when the extracted features are used for land-cover classification. Hence, in this paper, we try to explore the use of facade from the oblique images to enhance the accuracy of land-cover classification. Firstly, we locate the facades by finding the elevation changes and the corresponding above-ground objects. Then, the facade images are cropped from oblique images and the color and Haar-like features are extracted as facade features. Finally, following the object-based land-cover classification, super-pixels are generated and used as the basic unit for the feature extraction and classification. Experiments are performed on five representative site using five-head oblique aerial images and their derived orthophoto and digital surface model (DSM). The results show that with the facade information, the classification performances have been steadily improved, especially for the buildings which has around 10% improvement.\",\"Parsing building facades into procedural grammars plays an important role for 3D building model generation tasks, which have been long desired in computer vision. Deep learning is a promising approach to facade parsing, however, a straightforward solution by directly applying standard deep learning approaches cannot always yield the optimal results. This is primarily due to two reasons: 1) it is nontrivial to train existing semantic segmentation networks for facade parsing, e.g., Fully-Convolutional Neural Networks (FCN) which are usually weak at predicting fine-grained shapes (J. Long et al., 2015); and 2) building facades are man-made architectures with highly regularized shape priors, and the prior knowledge plays an important role in facade parsing, for which how to integrate the prior knowledge into deep neural networks remains an open problem. In this paper, we present a novel symmetric loss function that can be used in deep neural networks for end-to-end training. This novel loss is based on the assumption that most of windows and doors have a highly symmetric rectangle shape, and it penalizes all window predictions that are non-rectangles. This prior knowledge is smoothly integrated into the end-to-end training process. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our method has outperformed previous state-of-art methods significantly on five popular facade parsing datasets. Qualitative results have shown that our method effectively aids deep convolutional neural networks to predict more accurate, visually pleasing, and symmetric shapes.

architecture promotes a high demand for transparent building envelopes and especially glass facades. Commonly, facades are designed to fulfill a multitude of objectives such as superior aesthetic appearance, a higher degree of weathering reliability, quick installation, high transparency as well as economic and ecologic efficiency. For such glazing applications, often an assessment of acoustic properties and especially sound insulation abilities are required. Because of the complexity of such an experimental or computational investigation given the framing systems and glass unit compositions, a reliable and fairly accurate estimation of sound insulation properties of such systems becomes time-consuming and demanding. This paper provides a Machine Learning (ML) based estimation tool of acoustic properties (weighted sound insulation value RW, STC and OITC) of different glazing set-ups. A sufficiently rich database was used to train several machine learning algorithms. The acoustic properties are determined by comparing the third-octave or octave band spectrum of the sound reduction index with a reference curve (typical curve for solid construction elements) specified in the standard DIN EN ISO 717-1. Sound insulation values can currently only be determined by complex and expensive experimental investigations or numerical simulations for certain glass set-ups. Hence, there is no efficient tool for convenient and reliable estimation of the sound insulation performance of glazing systems available at the moment. To this end, the engineering team led by the authors conducted extensive studies on various glazings consisting of different glass assemblies with varying glass, cavity and interlayer thicknesses and different types of interlayer and gas fillings. Based on our research outcomes, a comprehensive web-based prediction program, the so-called AI Tool, has been developed recently. This program can provide a quick analysis and accurate prediction of arbitrary glazing set-ups, interlayers and glazing infills. A series of laboratory tests were conducted to validate the predictions by the AI Tool. The goal of this program is to provide designers, engineers, and architects an effective and economically efficient tool to facilitate the design w.r.t. acoustical properties.\",\"People spend approximately 90% of their lives indoors, and thus arguably, the indoor space design can significantly influence occupant well-being. Adequate views to the outside are one of the most cited indoor qualities related to occupant well-being. However, due to urbanization and densification trends, designers may have difficulties in providing vistas and views to the outside with an assortment of content, which can support the needs of their occupants. To better understand occupant view satisfaction and provide reliable design feedback to architects, existing view satisfaction data must be expanded to capture a wider variety of view scenarios and occupants. Most related research remains challenging in architectural practice due to a lack of easy-to-use early design analysis tools. However, early assessment of view can be advantageous as design decisions in early design, such as building orientation, plan layout, and facade design, can improve the view quality. This paper, hence, presents results from a 181 participant view satisfaction survey with 590 window views. The survey data is used to train a tree-regression model to predict view satisfaction. The prediction performance was compared to an existing view assessment framework through case studies. The result showed that the new prediction (RMSE = 0.65) is more accurate to the surveyed result than the framework (RMSE = 3.78). Further, the prediction performance was generally high (R-2 \\u003e= 0.64) for most responses, verifying the reliability. To facilitate view analysis in early design, this paper describes integrating the satisfaction prediction model and a ray-casting tool to compute view parameters in the CAD environment.\",\"The application of Double Skin Facades (DSFs) in hot climates is limited and their potential benefits are still under investigation. Moreover, daylight and thermal performances of the double facade are rarely studied together. In this paper a set of parameters are optimized for the design of a folded porous double facade for an existing office building in Cairo, with an aim of reducing cooling loads while maintaining daylight needs. The design and optimization processes take place using parametric design software, specifically Grasshopper Plugin for Rhino 3D modeller. These software tools were chosen due to the possibility of using evolutionary algorithms for multi-objective optimization, and environmental simulation plugins that provide real-time feedback during the early design phase. The existing building acts as a reference case to which the proposed facade is compared to evaluate its performance in South-East and North-West orientations. It is also compared to a conventional double facade. The paper discusses the effect of the design parameters on the thermal and daylight performances of the facade highlighting their preferred numerical range. Limitations of the software used are addressed, requiring verification of results using CFD simulations in future work.\",\"Daylight is an important factor that significantly contributes to patients' healing, with a reduction in the length of stay in the hospital. It can strongly affect energy consumption negatively or positively through lighting control strategies. Therefore, the case of healthcare buildings is very particular and sensitive, especially under extreme climate conditions as in hot and arid regions. The present study aims to determine a balance between daylight use and energy consumption through a parametric-based optimization of the external shading system in a typical hospital room in Biskra. This paper demonstrates how the implementation of parametric design with evolutionary algorithms is considered a reliable strategy to reach optimum solutions in building performance problems. The daylight performance is investigated based on multi-objective optimization to minimize the Energy Use Intensity EUI, while maximizing Spatial Daylight Autonomy sDA and Useful Daylight Illuminance UDI. A simulation model was developed via Grasshopper, which was employed with the use of Ladybug, Honeybee, and Octopus plug-ins. The results revealed that the adaptive facade system can improve indoor daylight levels and energy performance simultaneously compared to the conventional shading system. The presented framework may be used as a reference model, which can enhance opportunities to solve complex design problems in the early design stages and suggest recommendations for sustainable building design.\",\"Windows are one of the non-structural components of buildings that are most vulnerable to wind damage. It is important to obtain rapid and accurate predictions of wind-induced window damage in urban areas. A novel automated method for simulating the wind damage to building windows at the city scale is proposed in this study based on oblique photography, deep learning, and computational fluid dynamics technologies. First, a method for extracting building facade pixels from oblique aerial images is proposed to provide the data basis for subsequent window recognition. Second, the Pix2Pix deep learning network is utilized to recognize windows on building facades. Finally, the window damage in building clusters is evaluated automatically based on the window failure model and time-varying wind pressure data obtained through computational fluid dynamics simulations. A real-world community in Shenzhen, China, is used as a case study to showcase the workflow and demonstrate the reliability and feasibility of the proposed method. The proposed automated method overcomes the limitation that existing methods are difficult to apply to real building clusters. The novel method and corresponding case study presented here can provide a reference for urban areas to mitigate the impacts of wind disasters.\",\"Probabilistic methods can be used to account for uncertainties in hygrothermal analysis of building envelopes. This paper presents methods for robust mould reliability analysis and identification of critical parameters. Mould indices are calculated by probabilistic hygrothermal analysis, followed by the application of the Finnish mould growth model. To increase the robustness of the mould growth analysis, a random forests metamodel is first trained on the dataset and then used to expand the number of simulations. Finally, the reliability is calculated based on the probability of exceeding a given maximum mould index limit state. Critical parameters are identified through a sensitivity analysis based on linear and non-linear dependencies between inputs and maximum mould index. The methods are demonstrated by analysing three external wall assemblies. In conclusion, the mould reliability analysis method helps to assess the robustness of the hygrothermal analysis and mould assessment by investigating the influence of hygrothermal variables' uncertainties on the maximum mould index. By combining a metamodel with probabilistic analysis, it is possible to significantly reduce the amount of time required to evaluate a large number of scenarios.\",\"Building databases are important assets when estimating and planning for national energy savings from energy retrofitting. However, databases often lack information on building characteristics needed to determine the feasibility of specific energy conservation measures. In this paper, machine learning methods are used to enrich the Swedish database of Energy Performance Certificates with building characteristics relevant for a chosen set of energy retrofitting packages. The study is limited to the Swedish multifamily building stock constructed between 1945 and 1975, as these buildings are facing refurbishment needs that advantageously can be combined with energy retrofitting. In total, 514 ocular observations were conducted in Google Street View of two building characteristics that were needed to determine the feasibility of the chosen energy retrofitting packages: (i) building type and (ii) suitability for additional facade insulation. Results showed that these building characteristics could be predicted with an accuracy of 88.9% and 72.5% respectively. It could be concluded that machine learning methods show promising potential to enrich building databases with building characteristics relevant for energy retrofitting, which in turn can improve estimations of national energy savings potential.\",\"Successful daylighting design is a complex task which requires the designer to consider numerous design elements and their effects on multiple performance criteria. Facades, in particular, include many variables which may dramatically impact daylighting performance. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are optimization methods which are suitable for searching large solution spaces, such as those presented by design problems. This article presents a GA-based tool which facilitates the exploration of facade designs generated based on illuminance and\\u002for glare objectives. The method allows the user to input an original 3d massing model and performance goals. The overall building form remains the same while facade elements may change. Ten parameters are considered, including materials and geometry of apertures and shading devices. A simple building data model is used to automatically generate a 3d model of each solution. Results from single- and multi-objective case studies are presented to demonstrate a successful goal-driven design exploration process.\",\"The selection of high-performance building facade systems is essential to promote building energy efficiency. However, this selection is highly dependent on early-stage design decisions, which are extremely challenging considering numerous design parameters with early-stage uncertainties. This paper aims to evaluate the appli-cability of deep learning networks in estimating the energy savings of different facade alternatives in the early-stage design of buildings. The energy performance of two competing facade systems (i.e., Ultra-High-Performance Fiber-Reinforced-Concrete and conventional panels) was estimated for different scenarios through building en-ergy simulations using EnergyPlusrm. Three deep learning networks were trained using the collected data from the simulation of fourteen buildings in fourteen different locations to estimate the heating, cooling, and total site energy savings. The accuracy of trained deep networks was compared with the accuracy of three common data-driven prediction models including, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, and Generalized Linear Regression. The results showed that the deep learning network trained to predict building total site energy savings had the highest accuracy among other models with a mean absolute error of 1.59 and a root mean square error of 3.48, followed by Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, and last Generalized Linear Regression. Similarly, deep networks trained to predict building cooling and heating energy savings had the lowest mean average error of 0.20 and 1.17, respectively, compared to other predictive models. It is expected the decision support system developed based on this methodology helps architects and designers to quantify the energy savings of different facade systems in early stages of design decisions.\",\"This paper presents a high-level overview of a methodology for analysing window shade use in existing buildings. Time-lapse photography is paired with a robust image recognition algorithm to facilitate assessment of shade use and identify any possible trends. The methodology applied on a high-rise building consisting of multiple open plan offices. The analysis showed that the mean shade occlusion and the shade movement rate depend on facade orientation, with the near-south facade having the highest values and the near-north facade having the lowest ones. An average shade use rate of 0.5\\u002fday was observed, with the 72% of the shades never adjusted, throughout the period of observation.\",\"The energy-efficient operation of microgrids -a localized grouping of consuming loads (domestic appliances, EVs, etc.) with distributed energy sources such as solar photovoltaic panels- suggests the deployment of Energy Management Systems (EMSs) that enable the actuation of controllable microgrid loads coupled with Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. Such tools are capable of optimizing the aggregated performance of the microgrid in an automated manner, based on an extensive network of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). Modular adaptable\\u002fdynamic building envelope (ADBE) solutions have been proven an effective solution-exploiting free facade areas instead of roof areas-for extending the thermal inertia and energy harvesting capacity in existing buildings of different nature (residential, commercial, industrial, etc.). This study presents the PLUG-N-HARVEST holistic workflow towards the delivery of an automatically controllable microgrid integrating active ADBE technologies (e.g., PVs, HVACs). The digital platform comprises cloud AI services and functionalities for energy-efficient management, data healing\\u002fcleansing, flexibility forecasting, and the security-by-design IoT to efficiently optimize the overall performance in near-zero energy buildings and microgrids. The current study presents the effective design and necessary digital integration steps towards the PLUG-N-HARVEST ICT platform alongside real-life verification test results, validating the performance of the platform.\",\"The association between a building facade involving a matrix of programmable windows, for a prototype house, and the adjustment of the natural light at the house interior is treated algorithmically. The facade operates as a dynamic filter between exterior and interior: it filters solar radiation and heat by allowing the modification of the chromatism and light transmittance of each individual window. Varying the number and the distribution of the active windows on the facade permits the regulation of the incoming sun light and affects the visual presence of the house. A generative grammar producing the language of the optimum facade patterns, is presented. The novelty is that the grammar instead of encoding stylistic conventions, captures performative constraints and encodes them visually, to produce efficient and elegant patterns on the facade.\",\"The design of moisture-durable building enclosures is complicated by the number of materials, exposure conditions, and performance requirements. Hygrothermal simulations are used to assess moisture durability, but these require in-depth knowledge to be properly implemented. Machine learning (ML) offers the opportunity to simplify the design process by eliminating the need to carry out hygrothermal simulations. ML was used to assess the moisture durability of a building enclosure design and simplify the design process. This work used ML to predict the mold index and maximum moisture content of layers in typical residential wall constructions. Results show that ML, within the constraints of the construction, including exposure conditions, does an excellent job in predicting performance compared to hygrothermal simulations with a coefficient of determination, R-2, over 0.90. Furthermore, the results indicate that the material properties of the vapor barrier and continuous insulation layer are strongly correlated to performance.\",\"Enclosed airspaces (EAs) are a common component of different energy efficient technologies in building envelopes which have intrinsic adaptive behavior under various climatic conditions. The need for comprehensive accurate numerical models without restrictions for different applications still exists. Thus, for the first time, machine learning and regression-based techniques (Ordinary least squares Linear Regression (OLR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), r-Nearest Neighbors (rNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)) were applied to develop precise models derived from the most credible experimental data with stochastic logic of testing and training in several runs. It was found that application of KRR, SVR, and ANN leads to the most desirable outcomes with highest R-2 (0.97-0.99), and lowest errors, however OLR does not provide satisfactory results (R-2 \\u003c0.6). Moreover, major deviations are observed for calculations by OLR, kNN, and rNN in horizontal EAs (thicknesses = 40mm) with downward heat flow direction.\",\"An adaptive control and system identification framework is presented. This framework is applied for closed-loop system identification and adaptive heating demand-response control for residential buildings. The building envelope, considered for control purposes within the context of a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy, is based on the simplified Resistive-Capacitive analogy. These models characterized with parametric and state uncertainty, are adapted by incorporating, on-line, learning-based Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) for the joint state-parameter based estimation problem. Learning-based Moving Horizon Estimation, in this context, incorporates a reinforcement learning (RL) strategy. The latter entails a Q-factor parametrized value function approximation of the MHE arrival cost which is adapted (learned) on-line using a temporal difference algorithm based on the MPC control policy.\",\"The selection of an energy-efficient building facade system, as one of the most important early-stage design decisions, plays a crucial role in reducing building energy use by controlling heat transmission between outdoor and indoor environments. This paper aims to evaluate the feasibility and applicability of gradient boosting machines in estimating the energy savings of different facade alternatives in the early-stage design of building facades. The energy performance of two competing facade systems was estimated for different scenarios using building energy simulations (i.e. EnergyPlus (TM)). Three gradient boosting machines were developed based on the data collected from the simulation of thirteen building types in fifteen different locations (i.e. 195 scenarios). The prediction performance of gradient boosting models was compared with the building energy simulation results of two new building models that were not used in the database development phase to validate the models. Moreover, the prediction power of the trained gradient boosting models was compared with three common prediction models (i.e. Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, and Generalized Linear Regression) based on several performance metrics. The results showed the superiority of gradient boosting machines over other models in estimating total site energy savings, heating energy savings, and buildings' cooling energy savings.\",\"This study aims to develop a machine learning and deep learning-based model for thermal performance prediction of PCM integrated roof building. Performance prediction is carried out using the newly proposed MKR index. Five machine learning and one deep learning technique are explored in order to predict the thermal performance of PCM integrated roof considering variations in thermophysical properties of PCM. Total 500 data points are generated using numerical simulations considering variations in thermophysical properties of PCM. The five machine learning models used in this study are Random forest regression, Extra trees regression, Gradient boosting regression, Extreme Gradient boosting regression, and Catboost regression. The results indicate that Gradient boosting regression is the best-performing model compared to other machine learning models. An artificial neural network is used as a deep learning approach for predicting the MKR index. The ANN-based model performed best among all five machine learning models and proved its efficacy in training, testing, and sensitivity analysis with the independent dataset.\",\"One of the biggest challenges is towards ensuring large-scale integration of photovoltaic systems into buildings. This work is aimed at presenting a building integrated photovoltaic system power prediction concerning the building's various orientations based on the machine learning data science tools. The proposed prediction methodology comprises a data quality stage, machine learning algorithm, weather clustering assessment, and an accuracy assessment. The results showed that the application of linear regression coefficients to the forecast outputs of the developed photovoltaic power generation neural network improved the PV power generation's forecast output. The final model resulted from accurate forecasts, exhibiting a root mean square error of 4.42% in NN, 16.86% in QSVM, and 8.76% in TREE. The results are presented with the building facade and roof application such as flat roof, south facade, east facade, and west facade.\",\"Data-driven models have become increasingly prominent in the building, architecture, and construction industries. One area ideally suited to exploit this powerful new technology is building performance simulation. Physics-based models have traditionally been used to estimate the energy flow, air movement, and heat balance of buildings. However, physics-based models require many assumptions, significant computational power, and a considerable amount of time to output predictions. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) with prefabricated or simulated data are likely to be a more feasible option for environmental analysis conducted by designers during the early design phase. Because ANNs require fewer inputs and shorter computation times and offer superior performance and potential for data augmentation, they have received increased attention for predicting the surface solar radiation on buildings. Furthermore, ANNs can provide innovative and quick design solutions, enabling designers to receive instantaneous feedback on the effects of a proposed change to a building's design. This research introduces deep learning methods as a means of simulating the annual radiation intensities and exposure level of buildings without the need for physics-based engines. We propose the CoolVox model to demonstrate the feasibility of using 3D convolutional neural networks to predict the surface radiation on building facades. The CoolVox model accurately predicted the radiation intensities of building facades under different boundary conditions and performed better than ARINet (with average mean square errors of 0.01 and 0.036, respectively) in predicting the radiation intensity both with (validation error = 0.0165) and without (validation error = 0.0066) the presence of boundary buildings.\",\"The authors present the first on-site investigation of artificial intelligence (AI)-integrated three-dimensionally movable kinetic facade (KF). Despite continued architectural interest on the KF to improve indoor visual comfort, its in-situ operational strategy has been little addressed. To examine our primary hypothesis that the adaptive KF controlled by AI models improves indoor daylight probability (DGP) in real time, we developed an electromagnetic hexagonal KF mechanism, and three machine-learning (ML) regressors (eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest (RFR), Decision Tree) were implemented on a Raspberry Pi board to control the KF (width = 1.73 m, height = 1.1 m). 20,000 data from Radiance were used for model construction, and illuminance sensors were installed for on-site validation in a private office mockup. The facade shape was optimally morphed every 90s, using differential evolution. In the verification, XGB showed the greatest accuracy (R2 = 91.2%) with decent prediction time efficiency (mu = 0.58 s), but the RFR accuracy (R2 = 79.8%) slightly outperformed XGB in the field.\",\"Modeling the photovoltaic (PV) energy output with high accuracy is essential for predicting and analyzing the performance of a PV system. In the particular cases of building-integrated and building-attached photovoltaic systems (BIPV and BAPV, respectively) the time-varying partial shading conditions are a relevant added difficulty for modeling the PV power conversion. The availability of laser imaging detection and ranging (LIDAR) data to create very-high-resolution elevation digital models can be effectively used for computing the shading at high resolution. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) has been used to model the power generation of different BIPV arrays on a 5 min basis using the meteorological and solar irradiance on-site conditions, as well as the shading patterns estimated from a digital surface model as inputs. The ANN model has been validated using three years of 5-min-basis monitored data showing very high accuracy (6-16% of relative error depending on the facade). The proposed methodology combines the shading computation from a digital surface model with powerful machine learning algorithms for modeling vertical PV arrays under partial shading conditions. The results presented here prove also the capability of the machine learning techniques towards the creation of a digital twin for the specific case of BIPV systems that complements the conventional monitoring strategies and can be used in the diagnosis of performance anomalies.\",\"The aim of this study is to compare vibration exposure to noise exposure from railway traffic in terms of equal annoyance, i.e., to determine when a certain noise level is equally annoying as a corresponding vibration velocity. Based on questionnaire data from the Train Vibration and Noise Effects (TVANE) research project from residential areas exposed to railway noise and vibration, the dose response relationship for annoyance was estimated. By comparing the relationships between exposure and annoyance for areas both with and without significant vibration exposure, the noise levels and vibration velocities that had an equal probability of causing annoyance was determined using logistic regression. The comparison gives a continuous mapping between vibration velocity in the ground and a corresponding noise level at the facade that are equally annoying. For equivalent noise level at the facade compared to maximum weighted vibration velocity in the ground the probability of annoyance is approximately 20% for 59 dB or 0.48 mm\\u002fs, and about 40% for 63 dB or 0.98 mm\\u002fs.\",\"Adaptive Facades (AFs) have proven to be effective as a building envelope that can enhance energy efficiency and thermal comfort. However, evaluating the performance of these AFs using the current building performance simulation (BPS) tools is complex, time-consuming, and computationally intensive. These limitations can be overcome by using a machine learning (ML) model as a method to assess the AF system efficiently during the early design stage. This study presents an alternative approach using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that can predict the hourly cooling loads of AF in significantly less time compared to BPS. To construct the model, a generative parametric simulation of office tower spaces with an AF shading system were simulated in terms of energy consumption using Honeybee add-on in Grasshopper which are linked to EnergyPlus for training the ANN model. The prediction results showed a highly accurate model that can estimate cooling loads within seconds.\",\"Urban built environments have grown dramatically worldwide in the past few decades due to rapid economic and population growths. The potential utilization of renewable resources is highly desirable for a healthy urban environment. Hence, urban wind energy exploration has captured increasing attention from urban planners, architects, engineers, and researchers for the sustainable growth of urban environments and the well-being of urban dwellers. Advances in technologies in the design and installation of wind energy systems in buildings are paving the way to enhance wind energy generation in urban environments. This article presents a perspective of wind energy exploration based on building and urban aerodynamics. In particular, this article presents a review of current developments of wind energy systems in the built environments, factors affecting urban wind flow and resulting consequences, examples of recent designs of urban\\u002fbuilding-based wind energy systems, including building integrated vertical axis wind turbine, power window, wind-induced vibration-based wind energy harvesters, double skin and other innovative building facade systems, and wind source exploration. The potential application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in the context of wind engineering and wind energy system is also presented.\",\"This paper focuses on using evolutionary algorithms during conceptual stages of design process for multi-criteria optimisation of building envelopes. An experiment is carried out in optimising a panelled building envelope. The design scenario for the experiment is based on the scenario described in Shea et al. (2006) for the building envelope of the Media Centre Building in Paris. However, in their research, the optimisation process only allowed panel configuration to be optimised. In this paper, the task is to approach the optimisation of the envelope of the same building, assuming it to be in the early phases of the design process. The space of possible solutions is therefore assumed to be much wider, and as a result both external building form and internal layout of functional activities are allowed to vary. The performance intent of the experiment remains the same as that of Shea et al. (2006), which was to maximise daylight and minimise afternoon direct sun hours in the building at certain specific locations.\",\"To predict the response of masonry buildings to various types of loads, engineers use finite element models, specifically solid-element and macro-element models. For predicting masonry responses to seismic events in particular, equivalent frame models-a subcategory of macro-element models-are a common choice because of their low computational cost. However, an existing bottleneck in modeling pipelines is generating the geometry of the model, which is currently a slow and laborious process that is done manually using computer-aided design tools. In this paper, we address this by automating the modelling process using recent advancements in computer vision and machine learning. We present an image-based end-to-end pipeline that automatically generates finite element meshes for solid-element and equivalent-frame models of the outer walls of free-standing historical masonry buildings. As the input, our framework requires RGB images of the buildings that are processed using structure-from-motion algorithms, which create 3D geometries, and convolutional neural networks, which segment the openings and their corners. These layers are then combined to generate level of detail models. We tested our pipeline on structures with irregular surface geometries and opening layouts. While generating the solid element mesh from the level of detail model is straightforward, generating equivalent frame models required algorithms for segmenting the facade and the meshing. Experts in the field analyzed the generated equivalent frame models and determined them to be useful for numerical modeling. These finite element geometries will be invaluable for future predictions of the seismic response of damaged and undamaged buildings. The codes and dataset are publicly available for future studies and benchmarking ( and ).\",\"Electrochromic (EC) glazing reduces the cooling load via solar radiation shielding. However, excessive solar radiation shielding increases the heating load. In other words, the energy-saving effect of EC glazing is dependent on the energy performance of the building. This study compares the heating and cooling loads reduction effects of static and EC glazing under various conditions to evaluate the regional applicability of EC glazing in Japan. Furthermore, to maximize the effect, we employ a machine learning (ML)-based operation and evaluate its efficiency. A parametric study is conducted based on a standard office model in Japan using the DesignBuilder software. The result shows that the heating and cooling loads reduces by 17.1% compared with low-E glazing in warm climates (Miyazaki, Zone 7). However, in cold climates (Obihiro, Zone 2), the energy increase is 25.4% and the trend of the effect changes near Zone 4. Therefore, on days when the heating load is expected to occur in Zones 3-5, we incorporate solar heat before working hours. The results show that reduction in heating and cooling loads of 2-3% can be expected and that the operation schedule can be set accurately via ML.\",\"An accurate estimation of the extreme wind pressure acting on glazed panels is essential for the wind-resistant design of buildings. The traditional time-length-velocity (TVL) approach is severely dependent on the determination of the TVL factors and the selection of single-point measurement tap. To overcome the difficulties, this study aims to generate a generalized model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to reconstruct the super-resolution pressure distributions from low-resolution pressure measurements at different wind directions. The constraint represented by the pressure gradient are embedded in the loss function of the CNN to enable the model to generate real pressure distribution characteristics. By spatially averaging the super-resolution distri-butions, the peak space-averaged pressure on the glazed panels could be finally predicted. On the basis of a rectangle-section high-rise building, the regions near the top corner and near the middle-height under different wind directions are focused on. Results show that the pressure peaks computed from the super-resolution distributions can provide more accurate and robust representations for the true area-averaged peaks, compared with the traditional TVL method. The generalization ability of the pressure gradient guided SRCNN is systematically investigated among different pressure modes and flow patterns influenced by the incident angles.\",\"With an ever-increasing population, there is a sharp increase in the demand for residential areas. This has resulted in high-rise residential towers with building facades having balconies that not only serve utilitarian and aesthetic purposes but also provide air circulation and ventilation. Hence balconies become an important passive component to control the heat gain by the building. This paper investigates the effect of the geometry of the balcony and the material used for construction on the heat gain by the internal space, optimizing the cooling load. This study gauges the effect of various designs of building facades in terms of balcony geometry and material using Energy Plus and MATLAB-based neural network modeling. We use a surrogate model to predict simulation results and run various material properties to find the optimum material properties and the geometry of the balcony. We assume the balcony area to be fixed and find an optimum design using surrogate modeling. The results of this research can significantly reduce the energy consumption of high-rise buildings by keeping them cool.\",\"Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV), based on tandem PV cells, is considered a new alternative for combining solar energy with buildings. Accurately predicting the BIPV-harvested annual output energy (Eout,annual) is crucial for evaluating the BIPV performance. Machine learning (ML) is a potential candidate for solving such a problem without the time-consuming process of experimental investigations. This contribution proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the Eout,annual of 4-terminal perovskite\\u002fsilicon (psk\\u002fSi) PV cells under realistic environmental conditions. The input variables of the proposed model consist of the input solar irradiance (Pin), incident light's angle (Ain), the PV module's temperature (Tmod), the psk absorber's thickness (Thpsk), and the psk absorber's bandgap (Bpsk). The input data were received from the simulated results. This work also evaluates the degree of importance of each input variable and optimizes the architecture of the ANN using the surrogate algorithm before predictions. The optimized ANN-3 (three hidden layers) model shows superior performance indicators, including a mean squared error of MSE = 0.02283, correlation coefficient R = 0.99999, and Willmott's index of agreement Iw = 0.99999. Consequently, the predicted highest Eout,annual at Bpsk of 1.71 eV is 297.73, 115.01, 193.98, and 97.6 kWh\\u002fm2 for the rooftop, east, south, and west facades, respectively.\",\"In recent years, advanced control strategies based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) proved to be effective in optimizing the management of integrated energy systems in buildings, reducing energy costs and improving indoor comfort conditions when compared to traditional reactive controllers. However, the scalability and implementation of DRL controllers are still limited since they require a considerable amount of time before converging to a near-optimal solution. This issue is currently addressed in literature through the offline pre -training of the DRL agent. However this solution results in two main critical issues: (1) the need to develop a building surrogate model to perform the training task, and (2) the need to perform a fine-tuning process over several training episodes to obtain a near-optimal control policy.In this context, this paper introduces an Online Transfer Learning (OTL) strategy that exploits two knowledge-sharing techniques, weight-initialization and imitation learning, to transfer a DRL control policy from a source office building to various target buildings in a simulation environment coupling EnergyPlus and Python.A DRL controller based on discrete Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) is trained on the source building to manage the operation of a cooling system consisting of a chiller and a thermal storage. Several target buildings are defined to benchmark the performance of the OTL strategy with that of a Rule-Based Controller (RBC) and two DRL-based control strategies, deployed in offline and online fashion. The strategy adopted for OTL emulates the real world implementation with a simulation process by implementing the transferred DRL agent for a single episode in the target buildings. Target buildings have the same geometrical features and are served by the same energy system as the source building, but differ in terms of weather conditions, electricity price schedules, occupancy patterns, and building envelope efficiency levels. The results show that the OTL strategy can reduce the cumulated sum of temperature violations on average by 50% and 80% respectively when compared to RBC and online DRL while enhancing the energy system operation with electricity cost savings ranging between 20% and 40%. The OTL agent performs slightly worse than the offline DRL controller but it does not require any modeling effort and can be implemented directly on target buildings emulating a real-world implementation.\",\"Strong wind during extreme weather conditions (e.g., strong winds during typhoons) is one of the natural factors that cause the collapse of frame-type scaffolds used in facade work. This study developed an alert system for use in determining whether the scaffold structure could withstand the stress of the wind force. Conceptually, the scaffolds collapsed by the warning system developed in the study contains three modules. The first module involves the establishment of wind velocity prediction models. This study employed various deep learning and machine learning techniques, namely deep neural networks, long short-term memory neural networks, support vector regressions, random forest, and k-nearest neighbors. Then, the second module contains the analysis of wind force on the scaffolds. The third module involves the development of the scaffold collapse evaluation approach. The study area was Taichung City, Taiwan. This study collected meteorological data from the ground stations from 2012 to 2019. Results revealed that the system successfully predicted the possible collapse time for scaffolds within 1 to 6 h, and effectively issued a warning time. Overall, the warning system can provide practical warning information related to the destruction of scaffolds to construction teams in need of the information to reduce the damage risk.\",\"The use of active thermal energy storage can provide energy savings, cost reduction and CO2 mitigation by reducing energy demand for heating and cooling, allowing the use of peak load shifting strategies and enhancing the introduction of renewable energies in the sector. The high investment cost of these systems makes mandatory an appropriate control in order to maximize the energy benefits during its operation. Within this context artificial intelligence techniques have been successfully used to control active thermal energy storage units. This paper uses an experimentally validated numerical tool to study the effect of different control strategies on the performance of one TES system applied to the building sector, a ventilated facade with PCM which uses free cooling. Three different strategies were designed to control the ventilated facade based on cost savings, energy reduction and CO2 mitigation, under different climatic conditions. Results show robust benefits in the three tested control strategies, achieving average savings in comparison to a manual operation of the system of 4.3%, 7.8%, and 16.7%. Moreover, the paper shows that when the control strategy is focused on optimizing cost, the other two benefits claimed by TES systems (energy and CO2 mitigation) are significantly reduced.\",\"The ever-increasing attention towards implementation of environmentally sustainable buildings necessitates the predictions of energy consumption and indoor environmental quality (IEQ) during early design stages. Prefabrication of buildings changes the construction process and components which affects building performance. Better understanding the effects of envelope components on energy performance and IEQ will inform design decisions leading to the creation of more sustainable buildings. In this article multi-objective optimisations of building envelope were carried out by coupling TRNSYS (Transient System Simulation Tool) and jEPlus + EA (EnergyPlus simulation manager for parametrics + Evolutionary Algorithms). The objective functions to be minimised were thermal discomfort hours (TDH), daylight unsatisfied hours (DUH) and life cycle costs (LCC) while maintaining acceptable sound transmission levels and indoor air quality. The decision variables were envelope components of a prefabricated house. Applications for six different climate zones corresponding to eight locations in Australia were investigated. The optimal solution sets were unique for each climate zone. The optimal solutions achieved 27-31% savings in LCC compared to the baseline. The reductions for TDH varied from 6% to 55% among the locations. As a result of trade-offs, the selected compromised solutions in each climate could achieve better reductions for either TDH, LCC or both.\",\"Algal colonization on building facades causes paint defects, structural damages, and adverse effects on the health of occupants. Building managers need to be better informed about the status of the facade to develop effective maintenance programs. This study proposes a soft computing approach for predicting the appearance of algae on building facade with mortar cladding. The proposed approach is established by ensembles of Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system, named as ANFIS-ESM, with random subspace (RSE), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), random linear oracle (RLO), and stacking (STE) strategies. An experimental dataset which consists of 510 historical records and 12 conditioning factors has been collected for this research. Pre-training and post-training analyses on the importance of factors have also been performed by means of mutual information, ReliefF, and Fourier amplitude sensitivity test. Importantly, experimental results point out that STE strategy has attained the most accurate outcome with a classification accuracy rate (CAR) of 87.76% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91. Moreover, the proposed ensemble framework has outperformed other benchmark models including the support vector machine, the random forest, and the rotation forest. Therefore, ANFIS-ESM is a promising tool to assist building managers in establishing maintenance programs.\",\"Computational models capable of generating accurate site metrics for building performance analysis are often limited, complex and time-consuming. To address this gap, a new procedure has been developed with a five-step optimization process relevant to examining urban forms with buildings density constraints, window-to-wall ratio, incident solar radiation and energy production potential in facades. Factors analyzed include floor space intensity (FSI), building height (H), spatial daylight autonomy (sDA), annual sun exposure (ASE) and the effect of facade tilt angles on efficiency targets in cold climates. A myriad of parametric functions has been incorporated in the process through Grasshopper, DIVA, ArchSIM, and evolutionary algorithms in Galapagos. The study revealed effective results of energy production across prominent facade design options. Increasing FSI was found to decrease sDA, for a fixed H. In contrast, increasing H for a fixed FSI decreased sDA with an insignificant magnitude of 4%. The ratio of increase in glazing to increase in sDA was in the order of 1:1.47. Overall, the findings showed novelty in optimizing each facade panel to achieve best performance demonstrated by different urban densities with low\\u002fmid\\u002fhigh-rise building conditions. Energy production reached 13 kWh\\u002fm(2) with integrated photovoltaics, as a renewable source. High-rise buildings showed the best conceivable energy improvement as opposed to other height conditions. The improvement percentage was observed to be directly proportional to the height difference between the studied building and the surrounding context.\",\"By coupling parametric modelling, building performance (like energy efficiency) simulation, and algorithmic optimization, performance-based generative architectural design (PGAD) can automatically generate lots of high-performance architectural design solutions. Although it is 'performance-based', the final selection of a real design project still needs to consider the aesthetics of design choices. However, due to the overwhelming number of design choices generated by PGAD, it is difficult for designers to choose the most favourable one from them. Therefore, the current study tries to integrate the technology of sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) into the selecting stage of PGAD. Rather than navigating alternatives one from another and getting lost, designers can directly find the most aesthetically preferred one by inputting his\\u002fher hand-drawn design. A design project of fenestrating a multiple-floor office building is used to demonstrate this method and test three SBIR algorithms: Angular radial partitioning (ARP), Angular radial orientation partitioning (AROP), and Sketch-A-Net model (SAN). Test results show that AROP performs the best among these three algorithms. Its retrievals are most similar to inquiry images drawn by architects. Meanwhile, performances of AROP with different template combinations are also rated. After that, AROP with the best template is also tested with incompletely drawn inquiry images. In the end, investigation results are validated by another building facade design case. The current study automates the PGAD process stepwise, making it more applicable to real design projects.\",\"Occupant control of venetian blinds or fabric roller shades can have a significant impact on facade solar transmission, with cascading implications for daylight availability, energy reduction and Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ). However, field data describing how occupants operate interior shading devices is extremely limited leading to theoretical assumptions for the position and frequency of operation of shades or the discounting of shading devices entirely in simulation. This paper presents results of a 6-month field study conducted in open-plan daylit offices in a LEED Silver office building located in San Francisco, CA. In total, 78 workspaces were observed over multi-week periods to develop a data set describing the physical environmental conditions associated with shade operations and to collect observations of individual shade configurations. The paper compares observed behavior to existing behavioral models used in simulation and presents single-variable logistic regression models developed from this field data. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of observed shade control behavior for existing approaches to predicting annual daylight availability and solar loads during design and for compliance with energy codes and green building standards.\",\"The increase in global population, which negatively affects energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and arable land, necessitates designing sustainable habitation alternatives. Self-sufficient high-rise buildings, which integrate (electricity) generation and efficient usage of resources with dense habitation, can be a sustainable solution for future urbanisation. This paper focuses on transforming Europoint Towers in Rotterdam into self-sufficient buildings considering energy consumption and food production (lettuce crops) using artificial intelligence. Design parameters consist of the number of farming floors, shape, and the properties of the proposed facade skin that includes shading devices. Nine thousand samples are collected from various floor levels to predict self-sufficiency criteria using artificial neural networks (ANN). Optimisation problems with 117 decision variables are formulated using 45 ANN models that have very high prediction accuracies. 13 optimisation algorithms are used for an in-detail investigation of self-sufficiency at the building scale, and potential sufficiency at the neighbourhood scale. Results indicate that 100% and 43.7% self-sufficiencies could be reached for lettuce crops and electricity, respectively, for three buildings with 1800 residents. At the neighbourhood scale, lettuce production could be sufficient for 27,000 people with a decrease of self-sufficiency in terms of energy use of up to 11.6%. Consequently, this paper discusses the potentials and the improvements for self-sufficient high-rise buildings.\",\"The heating energy consumption in rural residential buildings is increasing in recent years. The 181 influencing factors which influence heating energy consumption mainly includes five parts: family basic information, rural residential building features, building envelope information, indoor air quality in winter and building heating energy consumption. Multiple linear regression analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the significant factors which affect rural building heating energy. Suitable and validated multiple regression model can use less variables to describe, explain and predict the heat energy consumption of rural residential buildings. Comparing different multiple linear regression models, one interactive exponential model which has goodness of fit, less predictive relative error and less influencing factors is optimal. This exponential model can be applied to predict heating energy consumption and annual heating energy consumption of per degree-days heating area of rural buildings. Logistic regression analysis can predict heating energy consumption from high, medium or low probability prediction classification and can evaluate the heating energy consumption level. Two regression analysis methods present a reliable, valid, and economical instrument for in-depth rural building energy saving research.\",\"Purpose: Numerous simulation software has been used to evaluate energy performance with 12% of the research focusing on long-term energy consumption prediction. This paper aims to utilize machine learning to predict the energy performance of building envelope wall materials over extended periods. Methodology: In our work, machine learning model learns from a large set of building envelopes simulated using the Integrated Environmental Solutions Virtual Environment as follows: Findings: Machine Learning models can also be used to predict the impact of building design and construction characteristics on energy consumption, showing that factors such as wall thickness, orientation, and thermal mass indicated lower relative standard error (\\u003c0.001); however, not all of them were statistically significant (p \\u003e 0.05). While the overall model indicates statistical significance (p = 2e-16), the multivariate linear regression model produces R2 value of 0.42, indicating a weak relationship between predictor variables and target attributes. Originality: The utilisation of Random forest algorithm for the wall envelop energy consumption Research implecation: different to other techniques, our proposed approach addressed the issue related to building envelop for new constructions to assist professional from construction industry.\",\"Thermally anisotropic building envelope (TABE) is a novel active building envelope that can save energy use to maintain thermal comfort in buildings by redirecting heat and coolness from building envelopes to thermal loops. Finite element models (FEMs) can be used to compute the heat fluxes through TABEs, but the high computational cost of finite element simulations has prevented parametric studies and design optimizations. This paper proposes a domain knowledge-informed, finite element-based machine learning framework to reduce the computation cost for the energy management of buildings installed with TABE that uses a ground thermal loop. First, the training heat flux data set was generated by FEM simulations with different thermal loop schedules. Then, both shallow learning models (i.e., multivariate linear regression and eXtreme Gradient Boost, or XGBoost) and a deep learning model (i.e., deep neural network, or DNN) were trained to predict the heat fluxes. Domain knowledge was used for data preprocessing and feature selection. Finally, the suitability of the selected machine learning model was tested under different thermal loop schedules. The case study results showed that: (1) XGBoost can be as accurate as DNN (coefficient of determination equal to 0.81) with much less training time; (2) the annual energy cost savings for different thermal loop schedules obtained by the XGBoost-predicted and FEMcalculated heat fluxes are consistent, having a difference of only 4%; and (3) XGBoost can reduce the computation time for the annual energy analysis of the case study building with a given thermal loop schedule from around 12 h by using FEM to less than 1 min.\",\"Application of Machine Learning (ML) in the field of architecture is a worthwhile topic to discuss in the context of digital architecture. Authors propose to extend this discussion, presenting an integrated ML pipeline built with the state-of-the-art data science tools. To investigate the affordances of such pipelines, an ML model being able to predict the environmental metrics of a generalized facade system is created. This approach is valid for arbitrary facades, as long as the proposed design could be discretized in the form analogous to the data generated for the ML model training. The presented experiment evaluates the precision of the sunlight hours and radiation values predictions, aiming at the application in the early design phases. Conducted investigation builds up on the knowledge embedded in the Grasshopper and Ladybug toolsets. Potential application of Convolutional Neural Networks and categorical datasets for classifications tasks to increase the precision of the ML models have been identified. Possibility to extend the approach beyond the workspace of Rhino and Grasshopper is suggested. Further research outlook, investigating the data pattern recognition capabilities in relation to the three-dimensional forms discretized as multidimensional arrays, is stated.\",\"The building envelope considerably influences building energy consumption. To enhance the energy efficiency of buildings, this paper proposes an approach to predict building energy consumption based on the design of the building envelope. The design parameters of the building envelope include the comprehensive heat transfer coefficient and solar radiation absorption coefficient of exterior walls, comprehensive heat transfer coefficient and solar radiation absorption coefficient of the roof, comprehensive heat transfer coefficient of outer windows, and window-wall ratio. The approach is applied to optimize the design parameters of the building envelope structure of a university teaching building in northern China. First, a building information model of a teaching building is established in Revit and imported into DesignBuilder energy consumption analysis software. Subsequently, a data set of the abovementioned 6 parameters is obtained by performing orthogonal testing and energy consumption simulations. On this basis, an RF model is used to predict building energy consumption and rank the importance of each parameter, and the Pearson function is used to evaluate the corresponding correlations. The results show that the most important parameters with the highest correlations to building energy consumption are the comprehensive heat transfer coefficients of the exterior walls and outer windows and the window-wall ratio. Finally, the RF prediction results are compared to the prediction results of a BP artificial neural network (BP-ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The findings indicate that the RF model exhibits notable advantages in building energy consumption prediction and is the optimal prediction model among the compared models. \",\"Aligning the European Union goals for climate neutrality by 2050 and the ambition for carbon equivalent emissions reduction to almost half by 2030 demands the exploration of alternative decarbonisation pathways. Energy consumption across all sectors is identified as a crucial contributor to this challenge, with a number of legislative and regulatory frameworks and commitments to be introduced every year. In response to these trends, the concept of exploiting a building's thermal mass through the integration of phase change materials (PCMs) enhances the ability of building elements to reserve and deliver large amounts of energy during phase transitions. However, the incorporation of PCMs into building elements requires the thorough understanding of their thermal behaviour. This study evaluates and predicts the thermophysical properties of mineral particles carrying PCMs and coated with a cementitious layer able to be utilised as fillers in construction applications. By employing deep learning and predictive modelling techniques, the numerical data-driven model developed in this paper enhances accuracy and efficiency in property estimation and prediction, facilitating material selection, system design, and optimisation. A model in a MATLAB simulation environment is presented, evaluating and predicting the thermophysical properties of semi-organic particles able to enhance building envelope thermal mass as a hybrid energy storage solution. These findings show the time needed for a building block to undergo cooling, demonstrating a clear upgrade in the thermal discharge of the walls. Substituting traditional EP with PCM-enhanced EP leads to a minimum reduction of 1 & DEG;C per hour in the discharge rate, thereby extending the comfort duration of indoor spaces without necessitating additional space heating. These models offer the potential for assessing diverse material compositions and usage scenarios, offering valuable insights to aid decisions in optimizing building energy efficiency.\",\"The Singapore government emphasises the importance of sustainable development of the country and set an ambitious target for the adoption of solar power in 2014. Though solar energy is the most promising renewable energy source for Singapore, there is insufficient space for large scale PV panels deployment and hence PV systems have to be integrated into the building environment. Urban morphology determines the effectiveness of PV panels in the urban environment and hence it is important to design the new developments carefully. However, there is a lack of tool and knowledge to estimate the solar energy potential of a new planning zone, so this study developed morphological based PV output and energy consumption predictive models to identify the urban form for effective PV systems deployment by multilinear regression. Three equations are built for predicting the building cooling energy consumption, PV generation on rooftop and facade and the R-2 of these three equations are 0.33, 0.44 and 0.48 respectively. The regression equations show that the urban setting for maximizing PV generation and minimizing cooling energy consumption is different. Furthermore, the low R-2 values of the three equations reflects that building the predictive models by linear regression may not be the most suitable option and other machine learning algorithms should be explored.\",\"Multi-functional kinetic facades have great potential to adapt to the environment, reduce building energy consumption, regulate shading and natural ventilation, and improve human thermal and visual comfort. However, due to their complex nature, kinetic facades systems are often associated with highly onerous time-consuming design and fabrication processes, which significantly limit their diffusion and market uptake. This research aims to propose an integrated, systematic framework that supports kinetic facades' performance design and decision making since projects' early design stages. The proposed method makes use of Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEA) which have proven successful in providing optimum solutions for complex problems. The efficacy of the framework is then validated based on a case study analysis to improve daylighting performance in an office building context. The results indicate that the integration of the proposed framework can provide a variety of data to support performance evaluation and to identify the most efficient kinetic facades solutions; moreover, this method provided a variety of optimal solutions using Pareto front and the Ranking Method; each being advantageous in a specific set of criteria as evidenced by improved useful daylight illuminance by up to 30%, daylight autonomy by up to 20% while keeping the under-lit and over-lit values as low as under 10%. Finally, future research can focus on the integration of soft computing methods to create a smart and intelligent performance evaluation framework for kinetic facades.\",\"The selection of an optimal building facade system is a challenging process that can be facilitated by using decision-analysis methods. However, current commonly-used decision-analysis tools in civil engineering cannot deal with the interactions among multiple design criteria. The Choquet integral is the only well-known method capable of accounting for such interactions. However, the process of assigning the fuzzy measures (importance weights) for this method is complex, particularly when there is a large number of criteria be considered. This paper proposes two supervised methods to estimate these fuzzy measures. The first method estimates the relative importance weights by using a statistical approach based on Principal Component Analysis, while the second method is elicited from a machine learning algorithm using Neural Networks. These two methods are used in an illustrative example to find the fuzzy measures related to facade design with respect to four criteria; and their merits and limitations are discussed.\",\"The objective of this study was to develop a prediction model for predicting the mould growth risk in wood-frame walls. A machine learning algorithm, the Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression was used for developing the model. Hygmthermal simulations were performed for a wood-frame wall with brick cladding using hourly historical and projected future climate data for cities located in different climate zones across Canada. The mould index calculated at the exterior layer of OSB was used as the response variable in the PLS model and the most relevant climate parameters were used as inputs including: temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind-driven rain, and solar radiation normal to the facade. The model was trained using a training set comprising two climate periods and different wall orientations for three cities. It was then used to predict the mould index for other years and wall orientations without performing the simulations. The coefficient of determination (R-2), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was used to evaluate the model's accuracy. Also, ranking and mould risk category analysis were carried out to assess the model's ability to rank the years according to their moisture severity. Results showed that with proper selection of training dataset, the model can be effectively used to predict the hygrothermal performance of brick-clad wood-frame wall assemblies in the selected cities and over both historical and future climates.\",\"Individual comfort is one necessary dimension from which to evaluate the indoor visual and thermal environment. However, the study of real-time, noncontact measurements of personal thermal comfort and the corresponding control system is not comprehensive. This paper aims to propose a workflow to design an adaptive facade that considers occupants' glare and thermal discomfort. From 280 valid questionnaires, the correlation between 13 defined postures and glare and thermal discomfort was determined. A CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is introduced to build a model to identify user behaviours. By taking the key point coordinates parsed by the OpenPose algorithm as input, the CNN-based model can recognize the 13 defined postures and a Sitting  type. An adaptive facade control system is proposed based on the captured occupant postures and spatial position. Validation results from volunteers showed that the CNN-based model could recognize user postures and respond immediately. After training for 40 epochs using 1260 videos as the training set, a model with 0.121 cross-entropy loss on the validation set was selected, and its accuracy reached 91.67% in the test. The adaptive facade units and the HVAC system are dynamically adjusted based on the extracted discomfort states. The set opening factor changes in steps of 0.1, and the set temperature of the HVAC system changes in steps of 1 degrees C at 15 min intervals. This allows the potential to build a personalized visual and thermal environment, which helps to improve the visual and thermal comfort of occupants.\",\"This study examined the personal characteristics and preferences of individuals that encourage interactions with smart media displays (media facades). Specifically, it aimed to determine which key aspects of a smart display media facade enhance intuitive interactions. A range of smart display technologies and their effects on interaction decisions were considered. Data were drawn from a survey of 200 randomly sampled residents and\\u002for visitors to a smart building, One Central Park, in Sydney, Australia. A binomial logistic regression analysis was undertaken to establish links between a range of design, perceptions and socio-demographic variables and individuals' decisions to interact with a smart media display. The results showed that the aesthetics of an installation, the quality of an installation's content and the safety of the operation-friendly environment significantly affected respondents' decisions to interact with the media display. Interestingly, respondents born overseas were more likely to interact with a smart display than those born in Australia. Respondents who expressed a preference for photograph-based interactions were also more likely to interact with the display. Somewhat surprisingly, age, residency and levels of familiarity with digital technology did not significantly affect respondents' decisions to interact with the display.\",\"Electric lighting energy expenses has gained importance in the last decades representing a large part of the global energy expense worldwide. The increase of the proportion of glazed building facades is an incomplete solution raising other problems regarding thermal and visual comfort, while rebound effects in terms of lighting usage lowered the energetic benefits of LED technology. Another strategy to address the issue of energy is the well-known strategy of the re-introduction of task lights. The current study presents a system arbitrating the contribution of daylight with general and task electric lighting from the prediction of key performance indicators (work plane illuminance and daylight glare probability) by a machine learning model. It aims at reducing energy consumption while minimizing the impact on occupants' comfort and productivity. This system was validated by the mean of a controlled user experiment with 60 participants. Altogether, our data revealed that RADIANCE simulations model accurately predicts on-site monitoring (R2 = .96) and that the machine learning model accurately predicts RADIANCE simulations for both work plane illuminance (R2 = .99) and daylight glare probability (R2 = .99) allowing to operate the automated system. Data from the user experiment shows that our system successfully saves 35 Wh on average compared to manual operation of the room by users, by making prior use of daylight and task lighting. This represents more than halving the energy demand. Importantly, the automation impacted neither users' comfort or task performance. System acceptance constructs such as system reliability or trust in the system were found to be linked with an attribution of the locus of control to powerful others. This result suggests that the key towards high user acceptance might lie in purposefully addressing this dimension. Altogether, the presented results support the potential for energy saving through the development of user-centred lighting automation.\",\"Building energy-saving retrofitting has become an essential way for the building sector to cope with cli-mate change. Furthermore, climate change affects building retrofit strategies. The current building stock is massive, which means there is a large demand for building retrofitting. Additionally, climatic conditions are changing, posing a significant challenge to the current time-consuming and labor-intensive decision-making process. To solve these problems, a dynamic intelligent building decision-making model was established in this study. The static and dynamic features of building retrofit decision-making were identified, four machine learning algorithms were considered, and a case base containing records for 301 retrofitted buildings was established for knowledge mining. The findings demonstrate that the XGBoost algorithm performs well in terms of building retrofit strategy prediction, with 77% accuracy for the prediction of building envelope retrofits and 76% accuracy for the prediction of HVAC system retrofits. In addition, the trends of building retrofit strategy decision-making considering dynamic climate conditions were observed. The demand for building envelope retrofitting and heating retrofitting has declined, while the demand for cooling retrofitting has increased. Some buildings are extremely sensitive to climate change, and some redundant retrofitting strategies should be avoided. The proposed intelligent decision-making model can provide valuable information for future building retrofit strategy decision-making.\",\"One of the primary aims of performance-oriented design is to develop spaces that achieve acceptable levels of human comfort. Wind-induced airflow plays a significant role in improving occupants' comfort in a building. This paper explores the extent to which simulation and evaluation of natural airflow can potentially be a contributing parameter in the conception of performance-aware designs. The authors employed Fast Fluid Dynamics simulation to study the natural ventilation performance of a pavilion and a genetic algorithm to optimize the shape of the pavilion's facades' openings. A performance analysis was conducted whereby an array of automated feedback loops carried out by a genetic algorithm produce a number of acceptable solutions. Hence the facade openings of these solutions are considered to be adequate to provide natural ventilation in the indoor environment. The study demonstrates the ability of the optimization model to yield design instances that fulfill a number of environmental criteria related to airflow and human comfort. In this light, the authors suggest that the aforementioned method can be used as an experimentation platform to influence and guide the designer during the initial stages of the design process towards a more performance-driven solution.\",\"Novel wood-plastic composites (WPC) have been on the market as facade panels for years, but they are rarely used. This study surveyed both building planners and laypersons about their attitude towards WPC facades and their willingness to apply them in commercial or private projects. By means of 24 items on product attributes, significant and measurable effects were identified by logistic regression analysis and categorised according to the theory of planned behaviour. Significantly different attitude characteristics were found for most of the items tested. It was shown that experts are strongly influenced by corporate-normative factors and base their decisions on fewer criteria, mainly from the field of product certification. Laypersons, on the other hand, are oriented on far more aspects regarding product and manufacturer. Experience with WPC was not an issue for both groups. The results guide manufacturers towards a more target group-specific product development.\",\"Visual design is associated with the use of some basic design elements and principles. Those are applied by the designers in the various disciplines for aesthetic purposes, relying on an intuitive and subjective process. Thus, numerical analysis of design visuals and disclosure of the aesthetic value embedded in them are considered as hard. However, it has become possible with emerging artificial intelligence technologies. This research aims at a neural network model, which recognizes and classifies the design principles over different domains. The domains include artwork produced since the late 20th century; professional photos; and facade pictures of contemporary buildings. The data collection and curation processes, including the production of computationally-based synthetic dataset, is genuine. The proposed model learns from the knowledge of myriads of original designs, by capturing the underlying shared patterns. It is expected to consolidate design processes by providing an aesthetic evaluation of the visual compositions with objectivity.\",\"An overview of commonly used methodologies based on the artificial intelligence approach is provided with a special emphasis on neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms. A description of selected applications to building energy systems of AI approaches is outlined. In particular, methods using the artificial intelligence approach for the following applications are discussed: Prediction energy use for one building or a set of buildings (served by one utility), Modeling of building envelope heat transfer, Controlling central plants in buildings, and Fault detection and diagnostics for building energy systems.\",\"Transmission losses through the building envelope account for a large proportion of building energy balance. One of the most important parameters for determining transmission losses is thermal transmittance. Although thermal transmittance does not take into account dynamic parameters, it is traditionally the most commonly used estimation of transmission losses due to its simplicity and efficiency. It is challenging to estimate the thermal transmittance of an existing building element because thermal properties are commonly unknown or not all the layers that make up the element can be found due to technical-drawing information loss. In such cases, experimental methods are essential, the most common of which is the heat-flux method (HFM). One of the main drawbacks of the HFM is the long measurement duration. This research presents the application of deep learning on HFM results by applying long-short term memory units on temperature difference and measured heat flux. This deep-learning regression problem predicts heat flux after the applied model is properly trained on temperature-difference input, which is backpropagated by measured heat flux. The paper shows the performance of the developed procedure on real-size walls under the simulated environmental conditions, while the possibility of practical application is shown in pilot in-situ measurements.\",\"Rainstorm damage caused by the malfunction of urban drainage systems and water intrusion due to defects in the building envelope can be considerable. Little research on this topic focused on the collection of damage data, the understanding of damage mechanisms and the deepening of data analysis methods. In this paper, the relative contribution of different failure mechanisms to the occurrence of rainstorm damage is investigated, as well as the extent to which these mechanisms relate to weather variables. For a case study in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, a property level home insurance database of around 3100 water-related damage claims was analysed. The records include comprehensive transcripts of communication between insurer, insured and damage assessment experts, which allowed claims to be classified according to their actual damage cause. The results show that roof and wall leakage is the most frequent failure mechanism causing precipitation-related claims, followed by blocked roof gutters, melting snow and sewer flooding. Claims related to sewer flooding were less present in the data, but are associated with significantly larger claim sizes than claims in the majority class, i. e. roof and wall leakages. Rare events logistic regression analysis revealed that maximum rainfall intensity and rainfall volume are significant predictors for the occurrence probability of precipitation-related claims. Moreover, it was found that claims associated with rainfall intensities smaller than 7-8mm in a 60-min window are mainly related to failure processes in the private domain, such as roof and wall leakages. For rainfall events that exceed the 7-8mmh(-1) threshold, the failure of systems in the public domain, such as sewer systems, start to contribute considerably to the overall occurrence probability of claims. The communication transcripts, however, lacked information to be conclusive about to which extent sewer-related claims were caused by overloading of sewer systems or failure of system components.\",\"Several substantial market barriers obstruct the widespread adoption of sustainable buildings. Esthetic features are amongst the main driving forces behind the marketability of buildings, thus improvement of sustainable buildings in terms of visual esthetics would enhance their marketability and thus their market intake. Nonetheless, esthetic improvement of the buildings is a challenging task because it lacks in scales and methods to measure and evaluate buildings' facade esthetic. In this regard, this study aims to develop machine learning-based models to predict the esthetic appreciation of buildings related to their facade features. For this purpose, an artificial neural network and decision tree models are developed and validated with the results of a conducted comprehensive survey (n = 807). In addition, the impact of different window features (i.e., position, number, area, width, height, symmetry, and proportion) on housings esthetic and marketability is investigated. Results show a high level of accuracy for both models in the prediction of esthetic appreciation of buildings. \",\"This Dataset provides a method of optimizing robot arm, facade pick and place locations in the construction site during facade assembly activity using generative design. A set of generative algorithms are provided in the form of graphical algorithm editors. The dataset is divided into three sets, each set controlling an essential subtask of facade assembly in the construction site. the dataset is called (iFOBOT) and consist of the following sub datasets: generative tool for facade population on building envelop (iFOBOT-D), Generative algorithm aided robot spatial location optimizer (iFOBOT-B), and Quantity take-off generative (iFOBOT-L). A sample project associated with its script and outcome results are included in this dataset to guide readers how to use this tool. This dataset only focuses on robot arm and facade module placement in construction sites. This dataset can generate optimized location of robot arm workstation in jobsite while also reducing robot collision with its body and surrounding objects, 2) reducing reachability rate, 3) reducing robot time travel during operation which in result minimize risk in facade assembly and increase productivity. This dataset is in parametric format which makes it reusable with all its history data using the reproducing guide provided here. More details of how to reuse this dataset and developed tool in construction site is covered in Robot-based Facade Spatial Assembly Optimization paper [1] \",\"Recent advances toward sustainable cities have promoted the concept of near-zero energy consumption. A Positive Energy Building (PEB) model has been developed by the European Union as part of Horizon 2020 to contribute to a cleaner neighborhood environment. To achieve PEB goals, a variety of factors must be optimized, including occupant comfort, building efficiency, economic benefits, and clean energy provision. Building modeling simulation combined with data-driven tools such as machine learning and artificial intelligence can be used to predict energy production and optimize passive and active systems. Based on these findings, this study evaluates studies from the past decade that include data-driven approaches, which accelerate different aspects of PEB, including supply and demand. These aspects include renewable energy supply prediction with the local context, optimizing comfort control with IoT, and reducing demand by optimizing building envelope design, materials selection, and active systems. While there are a few surveys regarding renewable energy management and energy efficiency in buildings, none simultaneously classified the algorithms in a PEB framework. Hence, this work inherently creates a technical framework for future researchers and building engineers to apply the appropriate data-driven approach for achieving net positive energy performance in residential, educational, and commercial buildings. Finally, comparing different applications suggests future research problems that can be addressed by integrating optimization algorithms and machine learning approaches, as well as data gaps that can be resolved to improve prediction accuracy.\",\"The durability of constructions is essential to the quality of life in urban spaces. Recently there has been a growing concern of the construction stakeholders with the durability of the materials used and construction sustainability. In this study, using a multinomial logistic regression technique, a probabilistic analysis of the degradation condition of rendered facades, as a function of age and type of mortar, is performed. The probability of the rendered facades reaching the end of their service life, i.e. the moment after which they no longer comply with the minimum performance requirements, is also evaluated. To that purpose, a sample of 100 case studies located in Lisbon, whose degradation state is determined by in situ visual inspections, is used.\",\"Microbial disfigurement of coated wooden surfaces is considered a major maintenance concern and will shorten the aesthetic service life of wooden facades. The effect of the physical surface structure of a paint film when applied on wood may have an impact on the susceptibility to mould growth. Six model paints were formulated to give the following physical surface structures: glossy, matt, soft, hard, hydrophobic, and a film with air inclusion. The model paints and a standard paint, with and without fungicide, were applied on panels of Norway spruce (Picea abies L Karst.) and exposed outdoors for nearly three years according to a modified version of EN 927-3. A logistic regression model was fit to the data, and the degree of mould growth varied with exposure time and type of paint. Hard model paint was significantly more susceptible than the other model paints and had a performance close to the standard paint without fungicide. Soft model paint provided the best performance, with the least mould growth. Temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation did not significantly contribute to the model. \",\"This paper demonstrates the validation and prediction of the wall temperature of a building exposed to a composite climate. Two artificial intelligence models, such as multiple linear regression and artificial neural networks, have been used to predict. The wall temperature has been predicted mainly based on the parameters like ambient temperature, wind speed and relative humidity in all four directions of the buildings. Three statistical analyses were used to validate the model's outcome: R-Squared, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). In terms of train and control data, the two models yield comparable findings. The artificial neural network model has more adaptability since it was able to adjust to unexpected changes in the input data, according to a comparison of the applied mathematics of each model. The regression model was used for this investigation because it gives constant estimate values for the factors, though the neural model isn't numerically characterized. The review infers that the neural model must be utilized as an additional way to predict the wall temperature. This study can plan and adapt buildings for future work, considering the most critical climatic conditions. It also assists architects and engineers in determining the appropriate insulation for the building envelope, which improves its thermal performance.\",\"Transition towards a carbon-neutral district energy community calls for carbon elimination and offsetting strategies, and phase change materials (PCMs) with substantial potential latent energy density can contribute significantly to carbon neutrality through both carbon-positive (like PCM-based thermal control in solar PVs) and carbon-negative strategies (like waste-to-energy recovery). However, roadmap for PCMs' application in carbon -neutral transition is ambiguous in the current academia, and a state-of-the-art overview on latent thermal storage is necessary. In this study, a comprehensive review was conducted on cutting-edge technologies for carbon -neutral transition with latent thermal storages. Both carbon-positive and carbon-negative strategies in the operational stage are reviewed. Carbon-positive solution mainly focuses on energy-efficient buildings, through a series of passive, active, and smart control strategies with artificial intelligence. Passive strategies, to enhance thermal inertia and thermal storage of building envelopes, mainly include free cooling, solar chimney, solar facade, and Trombe walls. Active strategies mainly include mechanical ventilations, active water pipe-embedded radiative cooling, and geothermal system integration. The ultimate target is to minimise building energy de-mands, with improved utilisation efficiency on natural heating (e.g., concentrated solar thermal energy, geothermal heating, and solar-driven ventilative heating) and cooling resources (e.g., ventilative cooling, geothermal cooling, and sky radiative cooling). As one of the most critical solutions to offset the released carbon emission, carbon-negative strategies with PCMs mainly include cleaner power production and waste heat re-covery. Main functions of PCMs include energy efficiency enhancement on cleaner power production, steady steam production, steady heat flux via the latent storage capacity, and pre-heat purpose on waste heat recovery. A thermal energy interaction network with transportation is formulated with PCMs' recovering heat from in-ternal combustion engines and spatiotemporal energy sharing, to provide frontier research guidelines. Future studies are recommended to spotlight standard testing procedure and database, benchmarks for suitable PCMs selection, seasonal cascaded energy storage, nanofluid-based heat transfer enhancement in PCMs, anti-corrosion, compatibility, thermochemical stability, and economic feasibility of PCMs. This study provides a clear roadmap on developing PCMs for transition towards a carbon-neutral district energy community, together with applica-tions, prospects, and challenges, paving the path for combined efforts from chemical materials synthesis and applications.\",\"Increasing the energy efficiency of the existing building stock can be accomplished by adding thermal insulation to the building envelope. In case of historic buildings with massive walls, internal insulation is often the only feasible post-insulation technique. Drawback of internal insulation is the modified hygrothermal response of the wall, which can result in moisture damage. Hence, it is crucial to assess the risk of damage accurately beforehand. Given the many uncertainties involved, a probabilistic assessment is advisable. This, however, would require thousands of simulations, which easily becomes computationally inhibitive. To overcome this time-efficiency issue, this paper proposes the use of neural networks to replace the original hygrothermal model. The neural network is trained on a small data set obtained from the hygrothermal model and can subsequently be used to predict the hygrothermal behaviour of building components with different boundary conditions and geometry. The transient nature of the hygrothermal behaviour requires a neural network type which can handle long-range time-dependencies. In the past, recurrent neural networks were often used for this type of data. Recently however, results indicate that convolutional neural networks can outperform recurrent neural networks on such tasks. This paper compares the prediction accuracy and training time of both neural network types for the prediction of the hygrothermal behaviour of building components.\",\"Architectural design of a facade, both at the aesthetic point of view and from the point of view of internal daylighting performance of the building, can be considered as a complex task. In this study, we implement a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to formally exploration the process of reconstruction of the education building's facade. The purpose of this research is to create a facade configuration by considering the size and location of elements and their materials when creating a suitable internal daylight distribution. The total construction cost of the building's exterior and the daylight performance of the building's interior are considered as objectives. The problem formulation includes two conflicting objectives, which are to increase daylighting aspect on each floor and reduce the total construction cost of the facade. To detect the approximation of Pareto fronts, including non-dominated solutions, we used a fast and elitist multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). Computational and architectural results show that NSGA-II is efficient enough to demonstrate eligible facade design alternatives.\",\"The capsule tower typology was a well-known visionary architectural idea during the 1960-70s. However, the few materialized projects were criticised mostly due to their use of standard-size capsules and their lack of adaptability to user needs. A new methodology for capsule tower design is proposed by means of the use of a genetic algorithm. in order to emphasise the generative approach of the original projects; it adds area and light optimisation to secure size variation and light comfort. The results show a set of variations in terms of floor layouts, capsule volumes, front facade areas and interstitial spaces amongst modules, which go beyond the uniformity of the earlier strategies. These early findings suggest that this generative approach has the potential of re-examine old design projects by increasing their feasibility and adaptability; this approach also suggests the possibility of combining this concept with additional algorithmic implementations to study other ideas.\",\"Recent Artificial Intelligence studies have achieved substantial improvements in practical tasks by using extensive amounts of data. We assume that a substantial part of the data to guide artificial design technologies resides in existing design examples. Developing ways to use this data may enable improvements in intelligent design tools, with the hope that these may provide more effective design workflows and more productive design practices. Such improvements may result in more in-depth evaluations of potentials and alternatives for design situations; hence better planning for the spatial environment. Various approaches have been developed to use representations of architectural examples for artificially tackling architectural design tasks. This study presents a review of the historical development of these approaches, with an overall aim to investigate where and how design examples have been used for practical computational design applications. The review encompasses traditional and recent Shape Grammar and Procedural Modeling studies, Case-Based Design, Similarity-Based Evaluation and Design, and recent studies on the architectural uses of Machine Vision, Semantic Modeling, Machine Learning, and Classification. The emphasis of the review is on the studies that aim at designing or generating new design examples, particularly for building layouts, facades, envelopes, and massing. For a comparative evaluation of the current capabilities of the examined lineages of studies, we propose a minimum set of design capabilities, and assess each study through this framework. This reveals the overall patterns of already covered requirements. The review shows that initial hand-operated SGs gave way to automatic generation, which in turn developed into automated SG extraction, through increasing levels of computational capabilities. Case Based Design has been neglected; however, it can be reinvigorated through novel Al techniques. On the other hand, Similarity-Based Evaluation may complement and balance the orientation towards technical performance. Machine Learning and Computer Vision appear as potential intermediaries for connecting these threads. There are example-based studies towards almost all aspects of artificial design; yet, these have not been tackled adequately or definitively. In particular, dynamic process control is still only a future potential. On the other hand, the examined research lineages have the potential to assume complementary roles for more capable and multifaceted design systems. As an overall result, example-based research perspectives raise important possibilities for intelligent design systems.\",\"Daylight is important for the well-being of humans. Therefore, many office buildings use large windows and glass facades to let more daylight into office spaces. However, this increases the chance of glare in office spaces, which results in visual discomfort. Shading systems in buildings can prevent glare but are not effectively adapted to changing sky conditions and sun position, thus losing valuable daylight. Moreover, many shading systems are also aesthetically unappealing. Electrochromic (EC) glass in this regard might be a better alternative, due to its light transmission properties that can be altered when a voltage is applied. EC glass facilitates zoning and also supports control of each zone separately. This allows the right amount of daylight at any time of the day. However, an effective control strategy is still required to efficiently control EC glass. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising control strategy that can learn from rewards and penalties and use this feedback to adapt to user inputs. We trained a Deep Q learning (DQN) agent on a set of weather data and visual comfort data, where the agent tries to adapt to the occupant's feedback while observing the sun position and radiation at given intervals. The trained DQN agent can avoid bright daylight and glare scenarios in 97% of the cases and increases the amount of useful daylight up to 90%, thus significantly reducing the need for artificial lighting.\",\"A deep energy retrofit of building envelopes is a vital strategy to reduce final energy use in existing buildings towards their net-zero emissions performance. Building energy modeling is a reliable technique that provides a pathway to analyze and optimize various energy-efficient building envelope measures. However, conventional optimization analyses are time-consuming and computationally expensive, especially for complex buildings and many optimization parameters. Therefore, this paper proposed a novel optimization algorithm, MEVO (metamodel-based evolutionary optimizer), developed to efficiently identify optimal retrofit solutions for building envelopes while minimizing the need for extensive simulations. The key innovation of MEVO lies in its integration of evolutionary techniques with design-of-computer experiments, machine learning, and metaheuristic optimization. This approach continuously refined a machine learning model through metaheuristic optimization, crossover, and mutation operations. Comparative assessments were conducted against four alternative metaheuristic algorithms and Bayesian optimization, demonstrating MEVO's effectiveness in reliably finding the best solution within a reduced computation time. A hypothesis test revealed that the proposed algorithm is significantly better than Bayesian optimization in finding the best cost values. Regarding computation time, the proposed algorithm is 4-7 times faster than the particle swarm optimization algorithm and has a similar computational speed as Bayesian Optimization.\",\"Damp walls of buildings are a serious problem due to the social and economic consequences. Moisture causes accelerated wear of facades, paint coatings, weakening of the wall structure, and high maintenance and renovation costs. The growth of fungi and bacteria worsens the indoor microclimate [1]. Effective identification of moisture inside the walls enables effective preventive actions. The paper presents an algorithmic concept that increases the quality of tomographic images showing the distribution of moisture inside the walls. The method solves the problem of monitoring the dampness of historical buildings and walls susceptible to moisture. The research focuses on solving the inverse problem of converting electrical measurements into spatial images. The study used a proprietary electrical impedance tomography system with specially designed electrodes. The measurement vector is converted to images in two stages. In the first stage, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was used, which generates raw reconstructions. The task of the second LSTM network is to convert the raw images obtained in the first stage into enhanced images. The application of the presented method is not limited to one type of narrow-sphere tomography. The two-stage approach can be easily adapted to, e.g., medical and industrial or process tomography. Therefore, it is a generic, universal method with great implementation potential, which is its great advantage.\",\"Approximately 40% of total energy demand in the European Union is consumed by the residential buildings sector, thus also significantly contributing to carbon dioxide emissions. Circa 28% of this energy demand is attributed to space heating and cooling, primarily influenced by the building's envelope and need to ensure indoor thermal comfort. Given this significant energy consumption, there is an urgent imperative to explore energy-saving strategies and develop tools to assess the effects of various design alternatives, with a focus on wall and roof characteristics. While existing white and black-box predictive models lack generalisation capabilities, the goal of this study is to develop and train a domain-informed grey-box Deep Learning model called Temp-AI -Estimator to predict the indoor temperature of buildings and containers (acting as surrogates for residential or office buildings as well as intermodal containers) based on measurements of external meteorological conditions (e.g. exterior temperature, humidity, etc.), as well as physical properties due to building construction set-ups in questions (ThermoProtect (thin coating), ThermoActive (thick coating) and thermal insulation). The major difficulty lies in making the model generalise beyond the three geographical locations included in the dataset (Berlin, Abu Dhabi, Texel). Experiments with LSTMs and Transformers as baseline models showed overfitting on the particular conditions at the sites in the training set, while failing to generalise to a new out-of-sample location. We propose to pass the model the numerical derivatives of the time-sequences, as these are less location-specific. The estimation of the necessary initial\\u002ffinal conditions is delegated to a very small network to minimise the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, we included a physically motivated module for modelling the latency and difference in amplitudes between exterior conditions and interior temperatures, informed by numerical approximation schemes of the differential equation of thermal conduction. Our experiments show that our domain-informed network achieves an increase in accuracy of almost 40% in addition to yielding results that can easily be inspected by human experts due to interpretability and explainability.\",\"Nearly 75% of EU buildings are not energy-efficient enough to meet the international climate goals, which triggers the need to develop sustainable construction techniques with high degree of resilience against climate change. In this context, a promising construction technique is represented by ventilated facades (VFs). This paper aims to propose three different VFs and the authors define a novel machine learning-based approach to evaluate and predict their energy performance under different boundary conditions, without the need for expensive on-site experimentations. The approach is based on the use of machine learning algorithms for the evaluation of different VF configurations and allows for the prediction of the temperatures in the cavities and of the heat fluxes. The authors trained different regression algorithms and obtained low prediction errors, in particular for temperatures. The authors used such models to simulate the thermo-physical behavior of the VFs and determined the most energy-efficient design variant. The authors found that regression trees allow for an accurate simulation of the thermal behavior of VFs. The authors also studied feature weights to determine the most relevant thermo-physical parameters. Finally, the authors determined the best design variant and the optimal air velocity in the cavity. This study is unique in four main aspects: the thermo-dynamic analysis is performed under different thermal masses, positions of the cavity and geometries; the VFs are mated with a controlled ventilation system, used to parameterize the thermodynamic behavior under stepwise variations of the air inflow; temperatures and heat fluxes are predicted through machine learning models; the best configuration is determined through simulations, with no onerous in situ experimentations needed.\",\"This paper reviews the state-of-the-art smart building research by a bibliometric analysis, a content analysis, and a qualitative review. The bibliometric analysis of 364 academic papers shows that smart building is a burgeoning, interdisciplinary field with a relatively high international collaboration level. Keyword's clustering identified two major themes: (1) IoT, WSN, and cloud computing for automation control and (2) the balance between energy efficiency and human comfort based on continuous monitoring and machine learning. The content analysis statistically detected a transition from the cyber-physical system (CPS) to the human-cyberphysical system (HCPS) in smart building research. We therefore proposed an HCPS framework with three dimensions-cyber-physical scale, human needs, and human roles-to summarize current research and discover potential gaps. Under this framework, five HCPS future research directions for occupants-centered smart buildings were proposed: adaptive building envelope, integrated building management system, enhanced building energy management, adaptive thermal comfort, and microgrid adoption.\",\"Road traffic noise in urban areas is a major source of annoyance. A quiet facade has been hypothesized to beneficially affect annoyance. However, only a limited number of studies investigated this hypothesis, and further quantification is needed. This study investigates the effect of a relatively quiet facade on the annoyance response. Logistic regression was performed in a large population based study (GLOBE, N similar to 18 000), to study the association between road traffic noise exposure at the most exposed dwelling facade (L-den) and annoyance in: (1) The subgroup with a relatively quiet facade (large difference in road traffic noise level between most and least exposed fac, ade (Q \\u003e 10 dB); (2) the subgroup without a relatively quiet facade (Q \\u003c 10 dB). Questionnaire data were linked to individual exposure assessment based on detailed spatial data (GIS) and standard modeling techniques. Annoyance was less likely (ORQ\\u003e10 \\u003c ORQ\\u003c10) in the subgroup with relatively quiet fac, ade compared to the subgroup without relatively quiet facade. The difference in response between groups seemed to increase with increasing Q and L-den. Results indicate that residents may benefit from a quiet fac, ade to the dwelling. \",\"This study aims to define the types of composition patterns of contemporary Polish multi-family building facades. The authors define the compositional patterns to determine their frequency. Analyses carried out on the basis of photos and visualizations of 113 examples of architecture from Poland identified groups of common features of facades. Statistical analyses of these features resulted in six types of compositions. Clear differences were noticed in relation to features, such as the repeatability of compositional elements and the method of building a vertical compositional axis. Variations were observed in the frequency and extent of application of specific types of compositions. The results of this study can be a starting point for the development of generative algorithms supporting the process of designing facades. Specifying the types will allow for further exploration of the theme, both in terms of the use of specific compositional measures and in terms of their perception.\",\"In order to obtain information about building daylighting performance earlier in the design stage, recent studies have begun to develop daylight prediction models using machine learning methods. Most studies have adopted design variation parameters as the input parameters for model training, but this method greatly limits the scope of application of the daylight model. By extending application to different design possibilities, this research proposes a novel daylight model, which includes a pre-processing procedure to convert the design model into Intermediary features as input parameters representing daylight penetration performance. By changing geometry of one kind of parametric facade and performing daylighting simulation, we were able to generate the data for training, including Intermediary features and sDA\\u002fASE values. The daylight model was then trained using an artificial neural network. Finally, the proposed daylight model was tested by predicting the daylight performance of other kinds of facades. The results indicated that the value of DA and ASE hours per grid were well predicted and that the daylight distribution was reproduced even with different kinds of facades. The deviations of sDA and ASE from simulation results ranged from 1.7 to 6.1% and 0.3-2.1 h respectively. The reproducibility, the predictive capability, and most importantly the extension of model applicability were all demonstrated for the proposed model. Furthermore, comparing to the daylighting simulation, the method using the proposed daylight model is estimated to save 9\\u002f10 daylighting evaluation time. This is critical for implementing the evaluation in the early design stage.\",\"The Digital Transformation offers completely new possibilities for architects and facade designers. Through the application of Artificial Intelligence many design decisions can be made automatically. Since most design tasks are ultimately unique and therefore not operational, fully automatic facade design will not always lead to a satisfactory result. For these reasons, the authors propose a targeted combination of rational (rule-based) and intuitive (poetic) design strategies. The design task is divided into operational subtasks that are processed automatically on the computer and non-operational subtasks that are solved by computers and humans together. A creative and agile design team evaluates different variants proposed by the computer. Promising developments will be pursued and further developed. Then the generative mechanism is adapted and the design is optimized. The concept is refined until a sustainable, user-oriented design is available. However, for the foreseeable future, the solution of non-operational problems will only be possible through human intelligence. The fear that good architecture can be generated at the push of a button and that computers will replace architects and engineers is therefore unfounded.\",\"In 2015, Taiwan's government announced the Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act, the goal of which was a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050, compared with 2005. The residential and commercial sectors produce approximately one third of all carbon emissions in Taiwan, and the number of construction renovation projects is much larger than that of new construction projects. In this paper, we considered the life-cycle CO2 (LCCO2) of a building envelope renovation project in Tainan and focused on local construction methods for typical row houses. The LCCO2 of 744 cases with various climate zones, orientations, and insulation and glazing types was calculated via EnergyPlus, SimaPro, and a local database (LCBA database), and the results were then used to develop a machine learning model. Our findings showed that the machine learning model was capable of predicting annual energy consumption and LCCO2. With regard to annual energy consumption, the RMSE was 227.09 kW center dot h (per year) and the R-2 was 0.992. For LCCO2, the RMSE was 2792.47 kgCO(2)eq and the R-2 was 0.989, which indicates a high-confidence process for decision making in the early stages of building design and renovation.\",\"Algal colonization on facade structure is a common phenomenon which significantly deteriorates the service quality of buildings and may even affect the health of residents. Thus, predicting the colonization progress of algae can be helpful to establish appropriate schedules and methods of building maintenance. This research investigates a machine learning solution for estimating algal colonization growth on mortar surfaces that relies on an artificial neural network (ANN). A data set of 539 experimental data samples has been collected to construct the proposed approaches. The cross-validation process reveals that the ANN has achieved an outstanding prediction performance with the correlation of determination (R2)=0.91 and the root-mean square error (RMSE)=5.69.\",\"Detailed monitoring of loads can provide sufficient information about buildings and help in improving the operation of energy systems. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) has become popular owing to its low cost and lack of disturbance in the occupied space. In this study, NILM methods based on artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) are proposed and compared to obtain the sub-loads of cooling loads. The cooling loads are disaggregated into four sub-loads: occupant load, equipment load, fresh air load, and building envelope load. Results showed both NILM methods could achieve load disaggregation accurately, but the RF-based NILM method performs better than that based on ANN. Moreover, the RF-based NILM method has mean relative errors (MREs) between 2.5% and 13.0%, while the ANN-based NILM method has MREs between 3.1% and 12.9%. Among the four sub-loads, the equipment load could be disaggregated with the highest accuracy. The detailed sub-loads obtained using the proposed NILM methods can guide building renovation and optimization design of building energy systems.\",\"Recent studies showed that deep learning techniques and image processing can identify the distinguishing design principles in architectural facades. However, predicting the strength of a principle is still a challenging task, as it requires a huge amount of annotated design variations. The difficulties in both searching such big numbers of data - and its labelling by experts - slow down the research. This paper proposes a computation approach for obtaining this type of data faster. With the help of parametric modelling and evolutionary algorithms, we could manipulate the design elements, and thereby generate different solutions. An integrated fuzzy logic decision mechanism could enable to carry human knowledge in the judging and labelling of alternatives automatically. The final synthetic data developed from real building images could be used for machine learning applications to enhance our understanding of artistic expression.\",\"Thermal losses through weak building envelope is responsible for global current energy crises. Application of artificial intelligence and drone setups in green buildings can help in providing the sustainable solution the world is striving for years. The contemporary research incorporates a novel concept of measuring the wearing thermal resistances in the building envelope with the aid of a drone system. The above procedure conducts a throughout building analysis by considering three prime environmental parameters such as wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH) and dry bulb temperature (DBT) with the aid of drone heat mapping procedure. The novelty of the study can be interpreted by the fact that prior researches have never explored the building envelope through a combination of drone and climatic conditions as variables in building areas difficult to access, thereby providing an easier, risk free, cost effective and efficient reading. Validation of the formula is authenticated by employing artificial intelligence-based software's which are applied for data prediction and optimization. Artificial models are established to validate the variables for each output from the specified number of climatic inputs. The pareto-optimal conditions attained after analysis are 44.90% RH, 12.61 degrees C DBT and 5.20 km\\u002fh WS. The variables and thermal resistance were validated with response surface methodology method, thereby presenting lowest error rate and comprehensive R-2 value, which are 0.547 and 0.97, respectively. Henceforth, employing drone-based technology in estimating building envelope discrepancies with the novel formula, yields consistent and effective assessment for development of green building, simultaneously reducing time and cost of the experimentation.\",\"Different simulation engines are currently required to perform daylight and energy evaluations of complex fenestration systems: Radiance has been validated to evaluate complex geometries but EnergyPlus cannot deal with them, making infeasible the thermal evaluations. The Shading Coefficient method adds an extra step to overcome that limitation: it runs irradiance simulations to create shading schedules that are shared between the simulation engines. This work supports the premise that Solar Energy Density (SED) can be used as a benchmark to evaluate the dual performance of perforated screens (PS). Therefore, only irradiance calculations will be required in evaluations - instead of running three different simulations. Orthogonal Arrays and Principal Component Analysis were the statistical techniques used to select the PS sample and weight the simulation results. The resultant SED thresholds concurrently fostered the accomplishment of daylighting and energy goals, at five different orientations: they maximised the daylit area and minimised the overlit area and total energy use. This work also presents an application example of the single-metric approach to test its effectiveness to perform single-objective optimization of PS design by using Evolutionary Algorithms. The SED approach has the advantage of reducing considerably the simulation time needed to perform the parametric optimization of PS.\",\"Employees' satisfaction and productivity is one of the main interests of employers. Psychological comfort can cause dissatisfaction with their work. Thus, it is important to understand what factors contribute to employees' satisfaction in workplaces. The purpose of this paper is to identify the weight of contribution of each design parameter on increasing psychological satisfaction. The study included 579 employees in five offices in The Netherlands through an online survey. The typologies of offices vary in terms of office layouts, orientations and facade. Additionally, a parameter of desk location was included as this factor may be associated with user satisfaction. Kruskal-Wallis H test, categorical regression, and logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the impact of these design parameters on psychological user satisfaction. The results revealed the impact of design parameters on the psychological satisfaction. The parameters of office layouts and desk locations were the significant predictor factors for the probability of satisfaction variables (e.g. privacy, concentration, communication, social contact and territoriality). The parameters for optimal satisfaction were found in cellular office, north-west oriented workstation and 4 m away from a window. Psychological comfort is an inevitable aspect in user satisfaction studies. This paper, therefore, measures and predicts the relationship between design factors and employees' satisfaction through case studies in The Netherlands. The findings help designers, architects, planners and facility managers to develop user-focussed office design principles supporting employees' work performance.\",\"Harvesting solar energy on rooftops can be a promising solution for providing affordable energy. This requires accurately estimating spatio-temporal solar photovoltaic (PV) potential on urban surfaces. However, it is still a challenge to obtain a fast and accurate estimation of rooftop solar PV potential over large urban built-up areas. Thus, this study proposes a parametric-based method to estimate annual rooftop solar irradiation at a fine spatial resolution. Specifically, seven parameters (Digital Surface Model, Sky View Factor, shadow from buildings, shadow from terrain, building volume to facade ratio, slope, and aspect) are determined that having great importance in modeling rooftop solar irradiation. Three machine learning methods (Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boost Regression Tree (GBRT), and AdaBoost) trained by the selected parameters are cross-compared based on R2, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and computation time. As a case study in Hong Kong, China, the RF outperformed GBRT and AdaBoost, with R2 = 0.77 and MAE = 22.83 kWh\\u002fm2\\u002fyear. The time for training and prediction of rooftop solar irradiation is within 13 h, achieving a 99.32% reduction in time compared to the physical-based hemispherical viewshed algorithm. These results suggest that the proposed method can provide an accurate and fast estimation of rooftop solar irradiation for large datasets.\",\"Integrated life-cycle assessment (LCA) tools have emerged as decision-making support for BIM practitioners during the design stage of sustainable projects. However, differences between methodologies applied for determining the environmental impact of buildings produce significant variations in the results obtained, making them difficult to be compared. In this study, a methodology is defined for generating environmental benchmarks for building typologies through a combination of BIM-based LCA tools and machine learning techniques. When applied to an 11-story residential building typology with 92 dwellings by varying the constructive solutions of facades, partitions, roof and thermal insulation materials, results fall within a range from 360 to 430 kgCO(2)eq\\u002fm(2). The Random Forest (RF) algorithm is successfully applied for identifying the most decisive variables in the analysis (partitions and facades), and shows signs of being useful for predicting the environmental impact of future constructions and to be applied to the analysis of greater scale urban zones.\",\"Due to the thermal inertia of building envelope and random uncertainty of occupant behaviors, real-time and accurate forecasting for building cooling and heating loads is not easy to implement. It requires not only favorable modeling methods, but also attention to the intrinsic cause analysis of loads. However, most previous studies have focused more on the improvement of forecasting algorithms, lacking the comprehensive analysis and scientific research from the load formation mechanism. To address this, a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-driven forecasting method integrating building thermal load characteristics, is proposed. This modeling approach takes into account both strong reflection ability of resistance-capacitance (RC) for the thermo-physical characteristics of building envelope and the superior handling capability of dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) for occupant uncertainties. Therewith, the independent building enve-lope model and occupant behavior model are established. Coupling the predicted values of these two sub-models, the building total load forecasting model is established using fuzzy radial basis function (RBF) neural network. A case study of an office building in Tianjin is utilized to validate the proposed method, revealing excellent predictive performance for both the sub-models and the total load model. The proposed method can effectively predict thermal load both from the for-mation mechanism of internal and external disturbances. It was found that the AI-driven model incorporating building thermal load characteristics, achieves significantly higher precision compared to the general data-driven model, with a reduction of 14.74% in coefficient of variation of root mean squared error in summer and 59.78% in winter.\",\"Wet foundations and walls of buildings significantly increase the energy consumption of buildings, and the drying of walls is one of the priority activities as part of thermal modernization, along with the insulation of the facades. This article discusses the research findings of detecting moisture decomposition within building walls utilizing electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and deep learning techniques. In particular, the focus was on algorithmic models whose task is transforming voltage measurements into spatial EIT images. Two homogeneous deep learning networks were used: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory). In addition, a new heterogeneous (hybrid) network was built with LSTM and CNN layers. Based on the reference reconstructions' simulation data, three separate neural network algorithmic models: CNN, LSTM, and the hybrid model (CNN+LSTM), were trained. Then, based on popular measures such as mean square error or correlation coefficient, the quality of the models was assessed with the reference images. The obtained research results showed that hybrid deep neural networks have great potential for solving the tomographic inverse problem. Furthermore, it has been proven that the proper joining of CNN and LSTM layers can improve the effect of EIT reconstructions.\",\"Parametric design and digital fabrication are becoming ubiquitous tools to contemporary architecture and imply a different design process. With this new perception of the contemporary production we have designed a facade sun shade using fractal geometry as a generative system. Fractals are complex shapes generated with simple rules, so it is relatively easy to change the final geometry when we work with parameters. The design process made possible the creation of different options for the brise-soleil using parametric definitions. Some solutions were physically modeled using rapid prototyping, which we consider an essential tool in the contemporary design process. The whole process conducted to the conclusion that architects need to incorporate a new set of skills when working with digital fabrication. Keywords: fractal, design process, generative system, digital fabrication.\",\"Building-Integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) have emerged as a promising sustainable energy solution, relying on accurate energy production predictions and effective decarbonization strategies for efficient deployment. This paper presents a novel approach that combines photogrammetry and deep learning techniques to address the problem of BIPV decarbonization. The method is called BIM-AITIZATION referring to the integration of BIM data, AI techniques, and automation principles. It integrates photogrammetric data into practical BIM parameters. In addition, it enhances the precision and reliability of PV energy prediction by using artificial intelligence strategies. The primary aim of this approach is to offer advanced, data-driven energy forecasts and BIPV decarbonization while fully automating the underlying process. To achieve this, the first step is to capture point cloud data of the building through photogrammetric acquisition. This data undergoes preprocessing to identify and remove unwanted points, followed by plan segmentation to extract the plan facade. After that, a meteorological dataset is assembled, incorporating various attributes that influence energy production, including solar irradiance parameters as well as BIM parameters. Finally, machine and deep learning techniques are used for accurate photovoltaic energy predictions and the automation of the entire process. Extensive experiments are conducted, including multiple tests aimed at assessing the performance of diverse machine learning models. The objective is to identify the most suitable model for our specific application. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is undertaken, comparing the performance of the proposed model against that of various established BIPV software tools. The outcomes reveal that the proposed approach surpasses existing software solutions in both accuracy and precision. To extend its applicability, the approach is evaluated using a building case study, demonstrating its ability to generalize effectively to new building data.\",\"Adaptive envelopes have the potential to significantly reduce energy use in buildings while ensuring high performance. These envelopes interact with multiple interconnected domains, such as daylight, indoor air quality, thermal comfort, and energy use, which can often conflict with one another. Identifying and developing suitable control strategies that can optimally manage the envelope's impact on many domains and avoid sub-optimal operations is an open challenge. Conventional approaches commonly adopted in buildings and building envelope control based on schedules or relatively simple decision trees may be unable to tackle the dynamic behaviour of adaptive envelopes. Due to their complexity, more advanced control approaches based on simulation-informed decision-making are scarce in both research and practice. In this work, we propose a multi-domain model-based control (MBC) algorithm for an adaptive facade concept based on a flexible Double Skin Facade (DSF). The proposed method, which aims for a balanced performance over different comfort domains and energy use, employs a co-simulation approach where the DSF is modelled in a Building Energy Simulation (BES) tool and the control algorithm to manage the simulation and optimize the control of the facade is developed in a generic programming language. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to design and demonstrate the effectiveness of a simulation-informed control strategy that can handle and optimise the behaviour of a complex facade by considering multiple performance objectives. The innovation of this approach lies in the MBC algorithm that selects the optimal facade state among over seventy possible states at each timestep, the practical demonstration of the feasibility in a BES tool, and the complexity of the controlled facade system. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed control approach, we compared the innovative MBC to more traditional control strategies, such as schedule and rule-based controls, revealing how it enabled the facade to achieve a better performance in all the analysed domains. By applying the MBC to three different year periods, we showed that the energy and environmental performance was within the selected comfort criteria for all the domains for\\u003e80% of the occupied hours, and an energy reduction of up to 70% was simultaneously obtained if compared to more traditional approaches. The control approach presented in this study and the simulation method employed can be used not only to improve the performance of advanced adaptive facades by providing an effective solution to the challenge of balancing multiple conflicting performance domains but also for more conventional building envelope systems that exhibit a certain degree of dynamic behaviour.\",\"Condition monitoring and timely repair of residential buildings is an important task when ensuring a comfortable life in cities. In the case of large metropolitan areas, it is a difficult task to perform continuous objective condition monitoring for tens of thousands of residential buildings by efforts of experts. However, residential infrastructure health can be predicted on the basis of indirect data. These can be objective building parameters or subjective data on citizens complaints about deterioration. In cities today, it is possible to collect such data in machine-readable form from various information systems. This article proposes a method to predict external deterioration of buildings on the basis of indirect data, using machine learning and SMILE Low-coding platform. Based on the results of method approbation, which used data of a metropolis, the significance of electronic participation data and objective parameters of objects for facade deterioration forecast was assessed. Options for further research are proposed to improve the quality of deterioration predicting by using data on citizens complaints about infrastructure damage.\",\"Adaptive architecture is expected to improve the performance of buildings and create more efficient building systems. One of the major research areas under this scope is the adaptive behavior of structural elements affected by load distribution. In order to achieve this, current studies develop structures that adapt by either following a database of precalculated equilibrium solutions or using self-learning algorithms to acquire active control systems to structures. This paper examined a case study element, which demonstrates an adaptive behavior in real time, based on self-learning abilities. The focus of this experiment was to gain control over a structural system as a whole (not only on a singular component) according to both objective and subjective parameters, that is, both load distribution parameters and spatial parameters, which are design related. The examined structural element was a canopy, situated in a dynamic environment that brought a change in the element's load distribution. The learning ability was given by applying a supervised learning algorithm-Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-on a physical prototype. The ANN was trained by an optimized database of finite solutions, which was created by a Genetic Algorithm. Through this method, complex calculations are conducted offline'', and the component operates in a decision-making'' mode in real time, adapting to a versatile environment while using minimal computational resources. Results show that the case study successfully exhibited self-learning and acquired the ability to adapt to unpredictable changing forces while keeping certain design requirements. This method can be applied over different structural elements (facade elements, canopies, structural components, etc.) to achieve adaptation to various parameters with an unpredictable pattern, such as human behavior or weather conditions.\",\"With the development of building design parameterization, more and more designers want to explore design options that optimize performance. However, the enormous time and costs that accompany optimization exploration are often beyond the reach of design practices. The application of machine learning in the construction field in recent years has offered potential solutions. Training predictive models through machine learning enables the rapid assessment of built environment performance and thus brings the optimization process closer to reality. In this paper, we mainly developed a process that integrates machine learning predictive model and multi-objective algorithms to achieve rapid evaluation and obtain optimal solutions. Using facade design as a case study, we demonstrate the design decision process with regard to the optimized solutions. The results showed that, through the proposed visual design decision process, designers can easily compare the performance and design appearance of different solutions and make informed decisions. In addition to saving 87% of time compared to the traditional simulation process, the integrated process also introduced the predictive model, which can achieve optimization exploration in one day. These results all demonstrate that the use of an integrated approach boasts considerable time advantages and potential feasibility in design practice.\",\"The accurate calculation of annual insolation for a large amount of building surfaces in urban environments is a key prerequisite for a targeted increase of the installed PV capacity. In this study, we build a digital city model upon publicly available geographic data. We use this model in combination with machine learning for performing PV potential analyses on large scales and at low computational costs. We train the machine learning algorithm using ground truth values for insolation, which we determine from forward ray tracing calculations for the city of Hanover, Germany. We find that our machine learning approach is able to predict the annual insolation for all types of building surfaces independent from their tilt and orientation. The RMSE relative to the mean ground truth value is 3.2% for rooftops and 8.8% for facades. The calculation time is reduced by a factor of 20 compared to the forward ray tracing approach.\",\"Digital design paradigms in architecture have been rooted in representational models which are geometry centered and therefore fail to capture building complexity holistically. Due to a lack of computational design methodologies, existing digital design workflows do little in predicting design performance in the early design stage and in most cases analysis and design optimization are done after a design is fixed. This work proposes a new computational design methodology, intended for use in the area of conceptual design of building design. The proposed methodology is implemented into a multi-agent system design toolkit which facilitates the generation of design alternatives using stochastic algorithms and their evaluation using multiple environmental performance metrics. The method allows the user to probabilistically explore the solution space by modeling the design parameters' architectural design components (i.e. facade panel) into modular programming blocks (agents) which interact in a bottom-up fashion. Different problem requirements (i.e. level of daylight inside a space, openings) described into agents' behavior allow for the coupling of data from different engineering fields (environmental design, structural design) into the a priori formation of architectural geometry. In the presented design experiment, a facade panel is modeled into an agent-based fashion and the multi-agent system toolkit is used to generate and evolve alternative facade panel configurations based on environmental parameters (daylight, energy consumption). The designer can develop the facade panel geometry, design behaviors, and performance criteria to evaluate the design alternatives. The toolkit relies on modular and functionally specific programming modules (agents), which provide a platform for facade design exploration by combining existing three-dimensional modeling and analysis software.\",\"This work analyzes data from an experimental study on facade sound insulation, consisting of independent repeated measurements executed by different laboratories on the same residential building. Mathematically, data can be seen as functions describing an acoustic parameter varying with frequency. The aim of this study is twofold. On one hand, considering the laboratory as the grouping variable, it is important to assess the within-group and between-group variability in the measurements. On the other hand, in building acoustics, it is known that sound insulation is more variable at low frequencies (from 50 to 100Hz), compared with higher frequencies (up to 5000Hz), and therefore, a multilevel functional model is employed to decompose the functional variance both at the measurement level and at the group level. This decomposition also allows for the ranking of the laboratories on the basis of measurement variability and performance at low frequencies (relative high variability) and over the whole spectrum. The former ranking is obtained via the principal component scores and the latter via an original Bayesian extension of the functional depth.\",\"Genetic algorithm (GA) are based on the continuation of fitter ones' lives considering the natural evolution. Data are coded as genes in the genetic algorithms. Optimal solutions can be achieved through the methods of crossing and mutation performed on these coded genes. Facade elements of the buildings with an architectural design in this study are independent of sustainability-related concerns, suggesting a great issue for the new buildings to be constructed in the traditional pattern. Accordingly, using the genetic algorithm method, proposals were presented for the new door and window typologies with genetic fitness for the architectural designing process of the buildings to be constructed in Surici Region, Diyarbakir, Turkey. Shape grammar, fractal and genetic algorithm, three generative designing systems, were used as the methods. Utilizing the genetic algorithm method, a field study was performed for the proposal of new door and window typologies with the fitness value. The field study was assessed through the plans and facade analyses regarding six Diyarbakir traditional houses with U plan type in Surici region of Diyarbakir. An identity card was created for the plan and facade data of the buildings and transferred to the table. Then, the door and window typologies of the exterior facade elements of each examined building were crossed within themselves with the GA method. As a result of the crossover, alternative joinery typologies with a total of 31 windows and 53 different door typologies with compatibility values were produced. Thus, the sustainability of the data of traditional joinery typologies for use in contemporary houses has been ensured. In conclusion, optimal alternative typologies were presented in regard to every chopping typology assessed with the genetic algorithm method. It is thought that this study should be a method that can be used in the production of exterior joinery typologies of contemporary houses to be built in many different cities of our country, especially in the historical texture. Thus, by using the GA method for the production of exterior joinery typologies of contemporary houses to be built in the region, different designers will be able to obtain various designs compatible with the traditional architectural texture while preserving their originality.\",\"In this study, comprehensive investigations were conducted on the structural behavior of masonry shear walls considering both aspect ratios and the axial forces. A reliable and simplified macro approach called Multi Pier (MP) method was employed to analyze single masonry piers with different aspect ratios (h\\u002fl). The shear and flexural strength along with the failure mechanism of each pier were obtained versus various levels of axial force during the sensitivity analysis. The results of the analysis were used as an input of a machine learning approach called Back Propagation Multi-Layer Perceptron (BPMLP) to generalize the data. The outcomes of machine learning was utilized to develop simple, but accurate equations as well as a user-friendly application to obtain the shear strength of a masonry pier according to the mechanical and geometrical properties. The BPMLP network is also able to produce and estimate all potential failure modes of a masonry wall. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed equations and developed application was evaluated using a novel macro-element approach. It is concluded that the proposed equations can be used in any macro-elements approach to enhancing efficiency and saving time. The proposed Equivalent Wall (EW) model was able to precisely estimate the response of full-scale facade masonry walls subjected to the in-plane loads. According to this model, each pier and spandrel was substituted by two elastic continuous (2D) macro-elements which connected via two bi-component discrete el-ements. A linear behavior based on masonry modulus of elasticity and bi-linear constitution according to the shear strength was assigned to the axial and shears components of the discrete links, respectively. The proposed EW model was verified using a five-story-seven-bay masonry wall. Satisfactory results were observed in terms of global load-deflection behavior comparing with popular approaches from the literature.\",\"The conception of a Generative Model (GM) is an important step when applying optimization methods in architectural design. The variant spectrum generable with a GM determines if an optimal solution for the different demands placed on a design can be found. Using the example of optimizing facades (more specifically window-layouts), it is shown that GM that exclusively vary either metric or topological properties of the geometry are not sufficient, because they only cover a highly restricted solution-space. To keep the solution space as large as possible, it is argued, that it is necessary to vary both topological and metric properties. The combination of both properties is called topo-metric properties. A GM for the generation of facade variants is presented, that is able to systematically vary these topo-metric properties. The effectiveness of the developed GM compared to conventional GMs is demonstrated using a simple test scenario.\",\"Robotic involvement in construction is still in its initial stages compared to other industries. Conventionally, the facade panel picking position is done manually by trial and error. The designer chooses a place to pick up a facade piece within reach of the robot arm, and then simulates the entire pick and place process in a digital model before applying to the assembly on the construction job site. After that the designer might detect errors, collisions, or singularities, which require the designer to modify the position of picking by changing the location or orientation of the module, thus repeating the simulation cycle until they reach a satisfactory result with no errors or collisions. This work is usually considered monotonous, inefficient, and time consuming. Therefore, this research proposes an optimization process implemented in design stage of construction project via static performance criteria in order to automatically search for the best picking location within the reach of the robot arm. The goal is to automate the process of robot location finding and solve the limitations of modular robot assembly simulation processes in order to allow for effective execution during the robotic construction implementation. The proposed approach, called iFobot, consists of three modules: Facade Generative Modeling (iFobot-D), Robot Position Optimization (iFobot-B), and Culminating Feedback to BIM (iFobot-L). Specifically, the scope of the paper is limited to the robot arm and facade picking and placing location finding processes. This research al lows initial assessment of the possible assembly process as regards the dimensions of modules and hence the overall dimensions of the system, which subsequently influences assembly implementation in the construction job site. A set of generative algorithms were developed using commercially developed visual programming language that automatically populate facade modules on the building envelope, find the robot and facade assembly locations with their quantity take-off, and integrate the module with the BIM environment. A case study has been developed to validate and test the proposed system. The results prove that the system generates optimized locations for the robot arm workstations with the lowest possible collision and reachability rate while addressing robot operation time reduction, thus reducing risks encountered during facade assembly and increasing productivity. Moreover, the iFobot is predicted to influence decision making during the facade assembly process on a physical construction job site.\",\"The factors affecting housing rent and take-up had been largely examined in a cluster. This leaves a dearth of knowledge on the influences of other disparate factors, such as the aesthetics of the building facade. This paper examines the effects of a deteriorated external wall paint on the tenants, rent and take-up of housing located in a high-end housing estate in Akure, Nigeria. The logic is to examine the place of aesthetics among the general factors affecting take-up and rental prices. Data were collected through census from 133 respondents residing in houses with deteriorated external wall paint. It applied both descriptive and multinomial logistic regression (MLR) to analyse the data. Findings Findings reveal that close to 60% of the respondents were psychologically affected by the visible deterioration of external wall paint. This translated to a significance reduction in rent compared with the rental prices of similar houses the appearance of which was not deteriorated. Generally, this study found that aesthetics paled into insignificance in the analysis of the general factors affecting housing take-up and rent. However, it ranked first when these were analysed on the structural characteristics of the house only. This is consistent with findings from the MLR parameter estimate, which shows that those who were psychologically affected are more likely to pay a 15% increase in their current rent to take up a similar house without paint deterioration. The findings of this study have implications on practice and theory. First, while the location mantra is a key determinant of rental prices in theory, in practice, rent on comparable houses could differ if the aesthetics of the external wall paint is compromised. This implies an avoidable loss of rent to the owner of a property who compromises the aesthetic quality of the external wall paint in a high-end location where affordability is arguably high. The implication on public authority is that a lower rent may have a negative implication on government revenue and specifically property tax which is normally based on market rent of a property. A novel quality of the study is that it separates the structural characteristics of a house from the general factors in order to examine the specific effect of deteriorated aesthetics of external wall paint on take-up and rent.\",\"Detailed parametric analysis and measurements are required to reduce building energy usage while maintaining acceptable thermal conditions. This research suggested a system that combines Building Information Modeling (BIM), machine learning, and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA II) to investigate the impact of building factors on energy usage and find the optimal design. A plugin is developed to receive sensor data and export all necessary information from BIM to MSSQL and Excel. The BIM model was imported to IDA Indoor Climate and Energy (IDA ICE) to execute an energy con-sumption simulation and then a pairwise test to produce the sample data set. To study the data set and develop a prediction model between building factors and energy usage, 11 machine learning algorithms are used. The best algorithm was Group Least Square Support Vector Machine (GLSSVM), later employed in NSGA II as the building energy consumption fitness function using Dynamo software. An NSGA II multi-objective optimization model is designed to reduce building energy consumption and optimize interior thermal comfort (measured by the predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD)). The Pareto front is calculated, and the optimum point approach is used to find the best combination of building envelope characteristics, HVAC setpoints, shading parameters, lighting, and air infiltration. The feasibility and effectiveness of the developed framework are demonstrated using a case study of an upper secondary school building in Norway; the results show that: (1) The GLSSVM has a unique capacity to forecast build-ing energy use with high accuracy: R2 of 0.99, an RMSE of 1.2, MSE of 1.44, and MAE of 0.89; (2) Building energy consumption and thermal comfort may be successfully improved by the GLSSVM-NSGA II hybrid technique, which reduces energy consumption by 37.5% and increases thermal comfort by 33.5%, respectively.\",\"As improved building energy efficiency becomes mandatory, dynamic shading systems are ex-pected to reduce building energy demand because their control mechanisms are increasingly self-adaptable to changes in the environment. Various shading control strategies had been proposed and compared in existing literature, but their energy performance can be further improved with a more comprehensive consideration of environmental changes and indoor demand. This study develops and validates an adaptive predictive control (APC) model for roller shades that combines simulation-based optimization of shading control with machine learning. The model predicts the appropriate position of roller shades based on multiple environmental parameters, minimizing the building energy demand. EnergyPlus and Python provide continuous energy simulation and data processing. Using pre-simulated datasets, machine learning algorithms develop APC models. The study scenario is a typical office space in Guangzhou, China. Quantitative analysis of the simulation results elucidates the effectiveness of the method. The performance of the model was evaluated using historical meteorological data from 2020. The proposed control model was able to achieve nearly optimal energy efficiency, reducing energy demand by 38.3% while reaching annual Useful Daylight Illuminances of 72.9%.\",\"Operation of environmentally responsive building components requires rapid prediction of the optimal adaptation of geometric shapes and positions, and such responsive configuration needs to be identified during the design process as early as possible. However, building simulation practices to characterize optimized shapes of various geometric design candidates are limited by complex simulation procedures, slow optimization, and lack of site information. This study suggests a practical approach to the design of responsive building facades by integrating on-site sensors, building performance simulation (BPS), machine-learning, and 3D geometry modeling on a unified design interface. To this end, a novel and efficient hybrid optimization algorithm, tabu-based adaptive pattern search simulated annealing (T-APSSA), was developed and integrated with wireless sensor data communication (using nRF24L01 and ESP8266 WiFi modules) on a parametric visual programming language (VPL) interface Rhino Grasshopper (0.9.0076, McNeel, Seattle, USA). The effectiveness of T-APSSA for early-stage BPS and optimal design is compared with other metaheuristic algorithms, and the proposed framework is validated by experimental optimal envelope (window shading) designs for single (daylight) and multiple (daylight and energy) objectives. Test results demonstrate the improved efficiency of T-APSSA in calculations (two to four times faster than other algorithms). This T-APSSA-integrated sensor-enabled design optimization practice supports rapid BPS and digital prototyping of responsive building facade design.\",\"This study aims to produce generative curtain wall geometries based on predetermined parameters such as storey information, shadow zones, preliminary building unit cost, frequency, etc. in a BIM platform for the preliminary design of a future project in Basmane and understand its novel outcomes and implications. The methodology is construed over four successive phases, namely: the built environment modeling, analyses for a solid understanding of the study area, determination of the generative design criteria, and finally design solutions. In the initial phase, the case-study building in Basmane with the surrounding environment was digitally modeled for the following analyses. Several programs apart from BIM have been utilized for the daylight zones and wind simulations. The daylight areas affecting the surface of the studied building were marked schematically per the simulation data. Subsequently, the area of the curtain wall, material type, preliminary building unit cost (assembly\\u002flabor and material cost), the height of storey, the density of elements, and fixed shading devices parameters were tested via optimization thru generative design methodology and provide potential design solutions by utilization of BIM tools. The findings of this study could be boiled down to a single comprehensive objective of generating outputs of assorted design solutions thru a generative design approach. When the output data set is visualized via parallel coordinate graphs, it could be well articulated that the classification of rule-based relationships and the criteria interrelations were based on the designer's decisions. Research Limitations\\u002fImplications This study was examined on a case basis by an experimental approach. It shall be considered that the curtain wall construction encompasses diverse materials, connection details, and construction techniques that affect the final cost thus this research was conducted at the preliminary design stage and might not reflect actual costs. Social\\u002fPractical Implications Albeit the technical aspect of the curtain walls is not included in this case study, it helps generative design culture by demonstrating the extent of the opportunities it offers to designers in the preliminary design stage. This study is a show-case of a preliminary design for an actual building stock in the vicinity of Basmane focusing on the building envelope design process with multiple parameters and should be regarded as an opportunity to understand how innovative solutions alike are put forward for the use of designers.\",\"Solar power forecasting is of high interest in managing any power system based on solar energy. In the case of photovoltaic (PV) systems, and building integrated PV (BIPV) in particular, it may help to better operate the power grid and to manage the power load and storage. Power forecasting directly based on PV time series has some advantages over solar irradiance forecasting first and PV power modeling afterwards. In this paper, the power forecasting for BIPV systems in a vertical facade is studied using machine learning algorithms based on decision trees. The forecasting scheme employs the skforecast library from the Python environment, which facilitates the implementation of different schemes for both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting applications. Firstly, deterministic forecasting of hourly BIPV power was performed with XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms for different cases, showing an improvement in forecasting accuracy when some exogenous variables were used. Secondly, probabilistic forecasting was performed with XGBoost combined with the Bootstrap method. The results of this paper show the capabilities of Random Forest and gradient boosting algorithms, such as XGBoost, to work as regressors in time series forecasting of BIPV power. Mean absolute error in the deterministic forecast, using the most influencing exogenous variables, were around 40% and close below 30% for the south and east array, respectively.\",\"Environmental factors directly affect a building's performance and durability. They are particularly detrimental in the case of building envelope materials and systems because these tend to exhibit a large exposed area and relatively narrow thickness. Therefore, tools are needed to model degradation and provide an insight into its occurrence and its relationship with the environmental factors that have the worst effect. In this paper, the degradation of stone wall cladding directly adhered to the substrate is estimated based on the evaluation of the characteristics of 140 wall cladding systems inspected in Lisbon, Portugal. Because it is a complex phenomenon, a probabilistic analysis is developed using multinomial logistic regression. The analysis focuses on the environmental factors that most influence the overall degradation of the facades (condition level). Probabilistic patterns are thus obtained for the evolution over time of each condition level according to their exposure level to outdoor environmental conditions.\",\"The housing sector consumes a significant amount of energy worldwide, which is mainly attributed to operating energy systems for the provision of thermally comfortable indoor environments. Although the literature in this field has focused on investigating critical factors in energy consumption, only a few studies have conducted a quantitative sensitivity analysis for thermal occupant factors (TOF) (i.e., metabolic rate and clothing level). Therefore, this paper introduces a framework for testing the criticality of TOF with a cross-comparison against building-related factors, considering the constraint of occupant thermal comfort. Using a building energy simulation model, the energy consumption of a case study is simulated, and building energy model alternatives are generated. The scope includes TOF and building envelope factors, with an established orthogonal experimental design. A popular branch of machine learning (ML) called linear genetic programming (LGP) is used to analyse the generated data from the experiment. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted using the developed LGP model to determine and rank the criticality of the considered factors. The findings reveal that occupants' metabolic rate and clothing level have relevancy factors of -0.48 and -0.38 respectively, which ranked them 2nd and 3rd against building envelope factors for achieving energy-efficient comfortable houses. This research contributes to the literature by introducing a framework that couples orthogonal experiment design with ML techniques to quantify the criticality of TOF and rank them against building-envelope factors.\",\"In recent years, especially in a building envelope, parametric design provides a method of continuous deformation of facade patterns until the architect finds interesting patterns or shapes that satisfy the desired aesthetics. However, these new design methods pose a question regarding the reasoning behind them, and sometimes the aesthetic interest dominates the true function of the envelope system and contrasts it. In opposite, too much engineering in the envelope system creates a problem with the identity of the facade. The purpose of this paper is to propose a method to integrate two different performances, quality and quantity, into one measurable goal. Using an existing building's facade as a case study, the building's facade was analyzed to understand the architect's logic behind its design. Then the found logic was programmed into the tool that allowed for the morphing of the facade into a different configuration, which can be evaluated by both quality and quantity performance to find the better solution to satisfy both goals. For the purpose of this paper, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms were considered to find solutions. For a quantitative objective, the indoor daylight availability was used as a measurement to allow for the best daylighting performance envelope system. For a qualitative objective, a matrix was developed to find the user's design preference and used it to evaluate and find a quantitative performance goal. The proposed method provides building facades that satisfy daylighting performance, and most importantly, it allows users to match their aesthetic sensibilities with the design preference.\",\"This paper describes the multi-objective optimized design of fenestration that is based on the facade of the building being divided into a number of small regularly spaced cells. The minimization of energy use and capital cost by a multi-objective genetic algorithm was investigated for: two alternative problem encodings (bit-string and integer); the application of constraint functions to control the aspect ratio of the windows; and the seeding of the search with feasible design solutions. It is concluded that the optimization approach is able to find near locally Pareto optimal solutions that have innovative architectural forms. Confidence in the optimality of the solutions was gained through repeated trail optimizations and a local search and sensitivity analysis. It was also concluded that seeding the optimization with feasible solutions was important in obtaining the optimum solutions when the window aspect ratio was constrained.\",\"Green building information modeling (Green BIM) is focused on a project using BIM as a basic tool from the beginning of the design stage and employs building performance analysis (BPA) in the design-analysis decision-making cycle to obtain an optimized design proposal. However, there are inevitable discrepancies between the simulated performance data and the data obtained from the actual environment. Neural network learning can be used in conjunction with training to obtain a predictive ability, and the resulting predictive values are more representative of actual performance than simulation values. In this study, it is proposed that a predictive value be used instead of a simulation value in judging whether design goals have been met. To construct an adaptive building envelope based on daylight simulation, this project plans to carry out the following six steps in a two-stage process: Stage 1: Data collection and learning: (1) BIM modeling, (2) BPA performance simulation, (3) production of an actual structure and illuminance measurement, and (4) collection of sample data to perform training in supervised neural network learning. Stage 2: After obtaining a predictive ability: (5) setting targets to find an optimized adaptation plan and (6) implementation of script-oriented automatic control.\",\"A genetic algorithm and an artificial neural network are deployed for the design of a dynamic multi-layered facade system that adapts in real-time to different weather and occupants' needs scenarios. The outputs are a set of different performances of the facade insulation cushions, optimized by the previous run of the genetic algorithm. A facade system of ETFE cushions is considered for them to learn from environmental data models. Each facade cushion is set up as an artificial neuron that is linked to the behavior and temperature of the others. The proposed outputs are a set of different performances of the facade system that are optimized through running the genetic algorithm. Facade neurons are configured as genes of the system that is abstractly represented on a digital model. The computational model manages cushion patterns' performances through several phenotypical adaptations, suggesting that the proposed facade system maximizes its thermal efficiency in different scenarios.\",\"The conventional control paradigm for a heat pump with a less efficient auxiliary heating element is to keep its temperature set point constant during the day. This constant temperature set point ensures that the heat pump operates in its more efficient heat-pump mode and minimizes the risk of activating the less efficient auxiliary heating element. As an alternative to a constant set-point strategy, this paper proposes a learning agent for a thermostat with a set-back strategy. This set-back strategy relaxes the set-point temperature during convenient moments, e.g., when the occupants are not at home. Finding an optimal set-back strategy requires solving a sequential decision-making process under uncertainty, which presents two challenges. The first challenge is that for most residential buildings, a description of the thermal characteristics of the building is unavailable and challenging to obtain. The second challenge is that the relevant information on the state, i.e., the building envelope, cannot be measured by the learning agent. In order to overcome these two challenges, our paper proposes an auto-encoder coupled with a batch reinforcement learning technique. The proposed approach is validated for two building types with different thermal characteristics for heating in the winter and cooling in the summer. The simulation results indicate that the proposed learning agent can reduce the energy consumption by 4%-9% during 100 winter days and by 9%-11% during 80 summer days compared to the conventional constant set-point strategy.\",\"This study assessed associations between house characteristics and mold and musty odor, using data from three consecutive (2005, 2010, and 2015) New Zealand House Condition Surveys, involving a total of 1616 timber-framed houses. Mold, musty odor, and house characteristics were assessed by independent building inspectors. We used multivariate logistic regression analyses mutually adjusted for other house characteristics for each survey separately. Positive and independent associations were found with tenure, ventilation, insulation, and envelope condition for both mold in living and bedrooms and musty odor. In particular, we found significant dose-response associations with envelope condition, ventilation, and insulation. Odds of mold increased 2.4-15.9 times (across surveys) in houses with the worst building envelope condition (BEC; p \\u003c 0.05-0.001 for trend); optimal ventilation reduced the risk of mold by 60% and the risk of musty odor by 70%-90% (p \\u003c 0.01 for trend). Other factors associated with mold and musty odor included: tenure, with an approximate doubling of odds of mold across surveys; and insulation with consistent dose-response patterns in all outcomes and surveys tested (p \\u003c 0.05 for trend in two surveys with mold and one survey for odor). In conclusion, this study showed the importance of BEC, ventilation, and insulation to avoiding harmful damp-related exposures.\",\"In this paper, we propose a method to quantify the likelihood that perforated exterior facade panels will produce wind-induced noise. This noise is generated by pressure fluctuations when vortices shed off the panels. The frequency and audibility are influenced by panel geometry, wind velocity, turbulence, and wind angle of incidence. We performed parametric computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analyses of perforated panels to calculate sound pressure levels and trained a machine learning algorithm on that data. We applied the learned relationship to a building scale CFD analysis accounting for annual variation of wind direction and strength to predict the likelihood of noise at any location on the building for a typical weather year.\",\"Building performance design plays a key role in reducing the energy consumption of buildings. However, the widely used simulation-based design is facing several challenges, such as the labor-intensive modeling process and the performance gaps between design stage estimations and operational energy use. For these reasons, artificial intelligent methods are expected by designers to improve the efficiency and reliability of building energy-efficient design. To date, there has not been a practical data-driven design method of envelopes. This study aimed at exploring data-driven building energy-efficient design of envelopes based on their quantified impacts. A feature selection method and a game-theoretic method were applied to quantify the impacts of envelopes on space heating and cooling energy, which were performed on two building datasets, one of which is from the U.S. and the other from China. Random forest classifiers were developed to conduct the study. Based on discovered energy patterns and quantified impacts of envelopes on energy consumption, a rectified linear design method of envelopes was proposed with the idea of improving the performance of high-impact envelopes. Besides, a validation study was conducted on two office buildings in the hot-summer cold-winter region. To design the envelopes of a building, the data-driven analysis was driven by its similar buildings other than the whole dataset. Moreover, a detailed energy simulation was conducted to evaluate the energy performance of different design solutions. The results showed that compared with baseline design solutions, new strategies could save 1.05%-21.2% energy for space heating and cooling for these two case buildings. The proposed method is a general building envelope design approach and allows designers to easily find an energy-efficient configuration of envelopes. This study demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the data-driven energy-efficient design of building envelopes.\",\"Artificial intelligence techniques have been successfully applied to control dynamic systems looking for an optimal control. Among those techniques, reinforcement learning has been shown as particularly effective at reducing the dimensionality of some real problems and solving control problems by learning from experience. The use of thermal energy storage active systems in the building sector is identified as suitable option to reduce their energy demand for heating and cooling. However, these systems might be expensive and require appropriate control strategies in order to improve the performance of the building. In this paper a ventilated facade with PCM is controlled using a reinforcement learning algorithm. The ventilated facade uses mechanical ventilation during nighttime to solidify the PCM and releases this cold stored to the inner environment during the peak demand period. It is crucial to decide correctly the schedule of charge and discharge process of the PCM according to the weather and indoor conditions. An experimentally validated numerical model is used to test the performance of the control algorithm under different weather conditions. Important improvements on the energy savings due to the use of control strategies were found and supported by the data under the different tested climatic conditions.\",\"Building thermal models, which characterize the properties of a building's envelope and thermal mass, are essential for accurate indoor temperature and cooling\\u002fheating demand prediction. Because of their flexibility and ease of use, data-driven models are increasingly used. This study compared and analyzed the performance of gray-box (resistance-capacitance) and black-box (recurrent neural network) models for predicting indoor air temperature in a real multi-zone commercial building. The developed resistance-capacitance model served as a benchmark model for which full sets of temporal data and building information were used as inputs. The recurrent neural network models were trained and tested assuming various available types and amounts of temporal data and known building physical information to investigate the effects of data and information availability. Feature importance analysis was conducted to select the key variables for different prediction targets under different scenarios. This research provides guidance in selecting an appropriate building thermal response modeling method based on the measured data availability, building physical information, and application.\",\"The application of energy-efficient strategies in buildings, such as the Green Building Concept, can significantly impact human comfort and resource consumption. However, due to the complexity of decision-making factors and the variety of available materials, computational models are necessary to identify the most effective solutions and optimise building energy performance. This study presents an integrated framework that uses machine learning algorithms and a Petri Net control system to optimise the thermal, comfort, and energy efficiency of both vertical and horizontal building envelopes in semi-arid climate zones. The framework incorporates several passive techniques for building energy parameters, including material thickness and melting point, window types, wall insulation thickness and thermal emissivity, wall solar absorbance, window wall ratio, fenestration position, air tightness, roof solar reflectance, roof insulation thickness and conductivity (W\\u002f(m.degrees C)), and floor insulation thickness. An experiment design was developed using Box-Behnken Design-Response Surface Methodology (BBD-RSM) for statistical optimisation, which was coupled with Design Builder simulation model. The methodology was demonstrated by applying it to a residential building in Mexico. Meta Additive Regression was used to analyse the output factors, which showed higher confidence compared to REP Tree and M5P Tree algorithms in green buildings. The results demonstrate that an annual energy reduction of 50 kW\\u002fm(2) per household can be achieved by using an optimised building envelope.\",\"Photovoltaic shading devices (PVSDs) not only generate electricity, but also control the solar radiation that passes through, thus enhancing the energy performance of the building. Geometry optimization and adjustable devices are considered as effective ways to improve the energy performance of PVSDs. Previously proposed methods fail to evaluate the importance of the geometric parameters of PVSDs comprehensively, and the proposed dynamic control strategy for adjustable PVSDs cannot respond to real-time weather changes. Therefore, this paper proposes an optimal design method for PVSDs to maximize energy performance by an optimized geometry and the proposed adaptive control model (ACM). Compared with previous studies, the proposed method integrates the influence of geometric parameters on energy performance, and the ACM proposed is able to adjust the tilt angle of PVSDs instantaneously based on real-time weather data. Subsequently, an office in Guangzhou was used as a case study for the evaluation to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that by using the optimized PVSDs, the cooling and lighting demand of the office is reduced by up to 48.7%. They are completely covered by the generated power, along with an energy surplus of 1034.4 kWh per year. In addition, daylighting in the office was enhanced, with a maximum UDI improvement of 71.6%.\",\"A high-efficiency perovskite\\u002fsilicon tandem solar cell has been a promising candidate for building -integrated photovoltaics. This work presents a deep learning approach to predicting the annual output energy harvested by the 2-terminal perovskite\\u002fsilicon tandem solar cells, thereby optimizing the tandem structure design. The data set for training and validating an artificial neural network (ANN) is the Atlas-simulated results of the tandem cell with the various perovskite layer's bandgap and thickness under the real-world conditions composed of the solar spectrum, incident spectral angle, and solar module temperature in a particular month of a year for a specific direction. Consequently, we reveal the significant influence of solar spectral shape on the ANN performance. The proposed ANN model has a mean square error of 1.26 and a correlation coefficient of 0.99979. Based on the spectral and environmental database in Gifu (Japan) in 2015, we predict that the optimal perovskite layer's bandgap and thickness are 1.72 eV and 680 nm for the east, south, and west facades, 1.73 eV and 700 nm for the rooftop, respectively. Consequently, the highest annual output energy obtained is 282.54, 105.07, 174.71, and 90.79 kWh\\u002fm2 for the rooftop, the east, south, and west facades, respectively.\",\"Building envelopes invariably tend to be static systems that encounter various performance limitations such as inefficient illuminance admittance, and heat and moisture transmission owing to their non-responsiveness towards environmental fluctuations. In contrast to such facade solutions, responsive facade systems with embedded sensing, actuation, and control systems have been proven to perform with up to 65% higher efficiency by being able to adapt their physical characters, such as orientation, and material property in real-time as a response to fluctuating environmental conditions (visual and thermal) and user preferences. Advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning processes further aid such responsive facade systems to optimize multiple parameters such as illuminance level and the associated lighting energy, visual discomfort caused by solar glare, solar heat gain, thermal resistance (heating energy and comfort level), and natural ventilation simultaneously. This research investigates the case of a real-time adaptive Building Integrated Photo Voltaic (BIPV) shading system and its ability (in comparison with traditional static building integrated photo voltaic facade systems) to perform as regards visual comfort and energy generation potential simultaneously within the humid subtropical climate of Sydney, Australia. A simulated case scenario wherein a real-time adaptive building integrated photo voltaic shading systems is deployed on a typical multistorey building facade in Sydney, Australia is accordingly presented. The conducted simulation considers the responsive building integrated photo voltaic system as a double-skin facade system and uses multi-objective evolutionary computing principles to decipher its integrability potential. A comparative analysis between traditional static mounted Photo Voltaic (PV) systems as opposed to multi-objective optimization driven real-time adaptive building integrated photo voltaic shading configurations is subsequently presented. The ability to maximize generated energy, while simultaneously maintaining visual comfort is thus a unique proposition of this research.\",\"Covering buildings with vegetation systems has been a significant feature of architectural design towards sustainability in recent years. This study reports an investigation on the green wall thermal performance compared to the bare wall on the northern facade of a 2-story residential building in the humid climate of Rasht during summertime. For experimental measurements, temperature and humidity data loggers were used for real-time data collection. Thereafter, an existing building was modeled in EnergyPlus for validation purposes. According to the results, a decrease in temperature and relative humidity was seen in the case of the building with a green wall. It was found that the green wall could drop the indoor temperature by 9% and also decrease the relative humidity level by 32%. Besides, in order to predict the green wall performance in a short time interval, a deep artificial neural network was trained from the experimental data and a 15-day weather dataset was collected and fed into the deep learning model. Moreover, the ENVI-met software is utilized to evaluate the effect of the green wall on the surrounding air. Findings indicated that the temperature in front of the green wall is slightly lower than the part of the wall without the plant. The highest temperate reduction was 0.36 degrees C at 12 p. m., which is insignificant.\",\"The performance of the building envelope of a large-scale public building significantly influences the energy consumption of such a building. This study aims to determine the best strategy for the envelope by examining the engineering design of the building in Nanchang University. The building shape coefficient, sun-shading strategies, window wall ratio, roof, and walls were studied through a method involving multilayer feed-forward neural network model simulations. Results show that the optimum shape coefficient value is 0.32. The combination of interior and exterior blinds and electrochromic glass is the ideal option to reduce the increase in the energy consumption of the architecture caused by solar radiation. Maintaining the window wall ratio at 0.4 is ideal. A green roof exerts a minimal effect on building energy consumption decrease (only 0.4%). Applying the strategy of vertical greening to the external wall can reduce cooling energy consumption by as much as 5.4%. Adopting the best envelope strategy combination can further decrease energy consumption by 20.8%. This strategy is also applicable to the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River in China, which flow through Nanchang and have a climate similar to that of the said area. Future research should be directed toward applying artificial neural networks to quantitatively evaluate the effects of a design strategy and produce the best design strategy combination.\",\"Unlike many previous studies that often focus on optimizing energy efficiency for buildings when detailed design drawings are available, this paper introduces a newly integrated model for energy-efficient building envelope design in the early stages (when detailed design drawings are not yet available). The newly developed model includes three main components: a simulation model, a predictive model, and an optimization model. The simulation model simulates the building's energy performance, considering different values for various envelope parameters. The predictive model employs machine learning algorithms, including RF, ANN, DNN, SVM, GENLIN, and GB (in which GB has been identified as the most suitable algorithm), boasting a very high R2(0.994) to assess energy consumption. The optimization model which uses AI optimization algorithms (such as NSGA II, DSE, and MOPSO) integrates the machine learning predictive model into the evaluation function during the evolutionary process, efficiently searching for Pareto-optimal building envelope solutions. Results show simultaneous savings in cost and energy, with savings of 7.52 % in cost and 8.48 % in energy, or 21.17 % in cost and 0.4 % in energy, for a case study in Vietnam. This model establishes a foundation by providing design solutions for stakeholders to assess, and can incorporate additional objectives at later stages.\",\"Consolidated urban areas usually present a challenge for the sustainable design decisions for the architect. The site, orientation and surrounding built environment compromise both passive and active systems, shortening the possible optimization measures available, leaving the designer with doubts as far as efficiency is concerned.BIM methodologies and visual programming languages have opened up a very wide range of design and analysis tools allowing the architect to make informed decisions based on data extracted from the models. Nonetheless it's optimization is through a slow process of trial and error, creating a significant limitation. This paper discusses the potentialities of the use of evolutionary algorithms to generate optimized solutions for facade solar orientation. A comparison between three different evolutionary algorithms aiming for solar radiation, inside average temperature allows to conclude the best result versus time consumed. Although under similar results the multi-objective EA represents the best compromise between time and final objective on the case study chosen for the paper. The interconnectivity in real time of BIM and algorithmic modeling softwares represents an advantage for time saving sustainable design decisions.\",\"The shift from conventional buildings to the so-called Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs) is becoming one of the major contemporary challenges in the world. In this work, a multi-objective optimization approach, based on a smart surrogate model, has been developed to minimize the energy consumption, improve the thermal comfort of the occupants and increase the energy self-sufficiency of residential buildings. For this purpose, two main phases have been considered: the first one is related to the development of the surrogate model, based on machine learning utilities, in particular Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and the second is related to the optimization process, performed by means of the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (MOPSO). This approach has been applied to a typical Moroccan building, Ground Floor thorn First Floor (GFFF), in different regulatory climate zones. The results show that the approach was successfully implemented using TRNSYS, Matlab and other numerical simulation tools, leading to different solutions in terms of building envelope design. The best-fit solution achieved a huge improvement potential in most climate zones, averaging about 75%, 50% and 85% respectively for energy consumption, thermal comfort and energy self-sufficiency of the studied building. Finally, we strongly recommend this approach to the various stakeholders in this field, including de-signers, engineers, architects, consulting firms, etc., since the results have proven its effectiveness as a very promising step towards designing Comfortable and Nearly Zero Energy Buildings. Future work will focus on the implementation of a hardware device that is able to perform all the steps of the proposed framework for possible pre-project optimizations.\",\"The Army Research Laboratory's Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliance (RCTA) is a program intended to change robots from tools that soldiers use into teammates with which soldiers can work. This requires the integration of fundamental and applied research in perception, artificial intelligence, and human-robot interaction. In October of 2014, the RCTA assessed progress towards integrating this research. This assessment was designed to evaluate the robot's performance when it used new capabilities to perform selected aspects of a mission. The assessed capabilities included the ability of the robot to: navigate semantically outdoors with respect to structures and landmarks, identify doors in the facades of buildings, and identify and track persons emerging from those doors. We present details of the mission-based vignettes that constituted the assessment, and evaluations of the robot's performance in these vignettes.\",\"Reliable data-driven models that estimate building envelope properties are indispensable for achieving emissions reduction targets. An extensive body of existing research investigates such methods, but benchmarking is limited and it is often unclear whether the approaches are scalable and robust to diverse building properties. Machine learning approaches, which natively handle complex, multivariate datasets, are rarely applied in this domain. This paper benchmarks seven different methods for characterization of the whole-building heat loss coefficient, including traditional gray box and novel black box approaches. To do so, a dataset of 16,000 simulated buildings is created. The models are benchmarked against ground truth, including an assessment of robustness to climate, construction materials, air-infiltration rate and occupant behaviour. We show the deep learning methods outperform other approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness, but that all of the approaches have limitations that restrain their practical usage. Based on this result, we suggest that further research is required to develop reliable and scalable approaches for the characteri-zation of quantitative envelope properties from sensor data. The model code, data creation pipeline and final dataset used for this work are open-sourced so that future work can expand on this study. We encourage the use of our framework to support innovation in this domain.\",\"Physical models and probabilistic applications often guide the study and characterization of natural phenomena in engineering. Such is the case of the study of air change rates (ACHs) in buildings for their complex mechanisms and high variability. It is not uncommon for the referred applications to be costly and impractical in both time and computation, resulting in the use of simplified methodologies and setups. The incorporation of airtightness limits to quantify adequate ACHs in national transpositions of the Energy Performance Building Directive (EPBD) exemplifies the issue. This research presents a roadmap for developing an alternative instrument, a compliance tool built with a Machine Learning (ML) framework, that overcomes some simplification issues regarding policy implementation while fulfilling practitioners' needs and general societal use. It relies on dwellings' terrain, geometric and airtightness characteristics, and meteorological data. Results from previous work on a region with a mild heating season in southern Europe apply in training and testing the proposed tool. The tool outputs numerical information on the air change rates performance of the building envelope, and a label, accordingly. On the test set, the best regressor showed mean absolute errors (MAE) below 1.02% for all the response variables, while the best classifier presented an average accuracy of 97.32%. These results are promising for the generalization of this methodology, with potential for application at regional, national, and European Union levels. The developed tool could be a complementary asset to energy certification programmes of either public or private initiatives.\",\"Unfinished buildings are a constant throughout the history of architecture and have given rise to intense debates on the opportuneness of their completion, in addition to offering alibis for theorizing about the compositional possibilities in coherence with the finished parts. The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) opens new avenues for the proposal of possibilities for the completion of unfinished architectures. Specifically, with the recent appearance of tools such as DALL-E, capable of completing images guided by a textual description, it is possible to count on the help of AI for architectural design tasks. In this article we explore the use of these new AI tools for the completion of unfinished facades of historical temples and analyse the still germinal stadium in the field of architectural graphic composition.\",\"Evaluating the blast loads that structures can be subjected to mainly relies on traditional design manuals that are mostly restricted to free-field explosions or to confined settings of simple geometry. However, the blast loads that apply to structures located in denser environments are significantly affected by the complex interactions of the blast wave with the urban topography. Many existing works address the effects resulting from such interactions; however, their scopes are mostly limited to considering a few buildings or streets, while the influence of building porosity on the shielding effect has received limited attention. This work utilizes validated high-fidelity numerical simulations to carry out a detailed investigation of the influence of a building's porosity (categorized as zero, low, mediumand high) on its capacity to shield virtual facades located at several distances behind the shielding structure. The results show that the shielding effect is mainly bounded below by that behind the high-porosity building and above by that behind the zero or low-porosity building, depending on the standoff distance to the charge. Finally, suitable scaling and modeling approaches including regression and machine learning techniques are applied to devise simplified, yet more general data -driven surrogate tools for computationally inexpensive predictions. These can contribute in helping design engineers evaluate blast loads behind porous structures following explosions in cityscapes.\",\"The envelope openings of houses have a strong implication in the indoor environmental quality and energy consumption. Nevertheless, there are no precise regulations for its design in equatorial tropics. Normally these designs are based in the previous experiences and common sense of the architect. Determining the correct configuration of a design problem with the desired performance is now possible with the introduction of Parametric Design and Genetic Algorithms; through these it's possible to obtain the best alternatives in the initial phase of design. The main focus of this investigation is to design windows that proportion adequate conditions of thermal and visual comfort, for a warm and humid tropical climate. The use of generative tools allows the evaluation of results in the initial stages of the project, giving the designer the possibility of choosing among diverse results with a high grade of efficiency and sustainability.\",\"We present our work on the training of robotised architectural components of intelligent buildings, focusing on main architectural components and features such as facades, roofs and partitions. The parameters governing such components may be either quantitative (such as temperature, humidity, configuration of the elements) or qualitative (such as ergonomics and aesthetics), which cannot easily be described by mathematical parameters. Due to their complexity,it is often impossible -or at least impractical, to hardcode suitable controllers for such robotised structures. Thus, we propose the use of Artificial Intelligence learning techniques, concretely Evolutionary Algorithms, so that the user can teach the robotised components how to behave in response to changing environmental conditions or user preferences. This idea is tested on an intelligent rooftop with variable geometry, that learns optimal configurations with respect to ambient light during training sessions.\",\"Different standard methods for the assessment of the thermal performance of the building envelope are used: analogy with coeval building, theoretical method, heat flow meter measurement, simple hot box, infrared thermography, and thermometric method. Review papers on these methods, applied in situ and in laboratory, have been published, focusing on theory, equipment, metrological performance, test conditions and data acquisition, data analysis, benefits, and limitations. However, steps forward have been done and not been deepened in previous works: in fact, the representative points method and the weighted area method have been proposed, too, whilst artificial intelligence and data-driven methods have begun to prove the reliability also in the U-value prevision using available datasets. Considering this context, this work aims at updating the literature background considering exclusively in situ methods. The work starts from bibliometric and scientometric analysis not previously conducted: this helped to group the methods and to sketch the innovations and the future perspectives. Indeed, from the bibliometric and scientometric literature analysis what emerged was (i) the richness of the background on this topic, especially in the recent years, (ii) two macro-groups (methods with and without measurements), and (iii) the importance of paper keywords (otherwise, interesting papers are eluded by the output of simple database queries). The method study that followed aims at providing (i) a broader view of the thermal transmittance (U-value) assessment procedures, including the utmost recent applications, proposal, and outlooks in this field, (ii) the understanding on the fundamental theories of the techniques, (iii) practical advice for building-envelope assessment, focusing on the advantages and limitations useful for professionals and researchers involved in the energy audit, conservation, or refurbishment of building stock, (iv) the identification of the interconnection between the techniques that often rely on one another, and (v) final remarks and future perspective of the procedures, which embrace the use of artificial intelligence (AI). From the topic analysis, as a result, it emerged that this is an open field for future research, especially with the implementation of AI, which requires good datasets and trials on the models' architectures, in terms of input layer, number of hidden layer and neurons, and percentage of data to be employed for model training and testing.\"],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"1_envelope_simulation_daylight\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[6.146266460418701,4.10521936416626,3.3482041358947754,3.3876378536224365,6.587753772735596,5.666935443878174,5.2180562019348145,3.3748457431793213,5.515674114227295,3.7252817153930664,4.341406345367432,4.0334792137146,5.754552364349365,5.614643096923828,3.9123101234436035,5.392429351806641,5.468471527099609,5.819150924682617,5.466152667999268,3.6252994537353516,5.820507049560547,6.002399444580078,5.035472869873047,6.2578229904174805,3.3792452812194824,9.439027786254883,3.6550707817077637,6.568240165710449,4.622781276702881,5.779889106750488,3.927826166152954,6.509665489196777,4.064582347869873,4.6565046310424805,5.399234294891357,3.5075998306274414,4.287501335144043,3.6773006916046143,4.57453727722168,5.335917949676514,5.31784725189209,5.838366508483887,4.937317371368408,5.312384605407715,4.596120834350586,5.769994258880615,3.4798426628112793,4.538220405578613,5.699127197265625,4.307064056396484,4.275635719299316,3.672342538833618,5.153195381164551,3.581261157989502,4.476955413818359,4.48464822769165,4.671517848968506,5.969802379608154,5.8376359939575195,4.925130844116211,3.9052536487579346,4.8533124923706055,5.728546142578125,5.628860950469971,5.519510746002197,4.5056586265563965,5.843462944030762,3.333785057067871,3.50716233253479,4.369290828704834,3.647143840789795,4.665872573852539,5.999342918395996,5.707961082458496,5.5175251960754395,4.82658576965332,6.002325534820557,4.410399436950684,4.957279682159424,4.188623428344727,5.2446818351745605,5.429446697235107,5.350640773773193,4.572641849517822,6.0543293952941895,3.447256326675415,4.158076763153076,5.794804096221924,5.306573867797852,5.426754951477051,6.050417423248291,3.9690358638763428,5.813131332397461,3.8676373958587646,5.739490985870361,4.204860210418701,4.570107936859131,5.7698540687561035,3.9265482425689697,6.0596699714660645,3.30134916305542,6.410093784332275,3.9180049896240234,3.966209888458252,5.650515556335449,4.981103420257568,3.7038564682006836,3.8181097507476807,3.8629541397094727,5.817419528961182,5.722933292388916,5.028458595275879,3.4325883388519287,3.29563570022583,4.901914119720459,3.8376882076263428,3.9554309844970703,5.655354022979736,6.210972309112549,5.113834381103516,3.9348862171173096,5.5663652420043945,4.944919109344482,3.6108853816986084,5.723820209503174,3.634910821914673,5.565769672393799,5.115405082702637,4.82667350769043,3.3637285232543945,4.645063400268555,3.9672932624816895,5.903277397155762,5.62432861328125,4.474643707275391,9.42386531829834,3.3427722454071045,3.9953577518463135,5.99998140335083],\"y\":[4.158638000488281,2.3413538932800293,1.9342597723007202,1.8180572986602783,4.064595699310303,4.164238929748535,2.962691307067871,1.7787226438522339,2.6202073097229004,2.813903331756592,3.20479679107666,1.3333892822265625,4.000129222869873,3.468135356903076,3.392836093902588,2.7028026580810547,2.945702314376831,1.7666298151016235,2.362196922302246,2.5459306240081787,1.7690844535827637,4.233912944793701,2.435718536376953,3.655529737472534,1.7017507553100586,3.2939870357513428,2.825359582901001,4.071616172790527,2.7310259342193604,1.8096115589141846,3.3682870864868164,4.086930274963379,3.3635082244873047,3.022716522216797,3.9088294506073,2.002714157104492,1.3360395431518555,2.743373394012451,3.0747692584991455,3.405496835708618,3.085306167602539,3.28062105178833,2.063214063644409,3.324293851852417,3.4246604442596436,1.825995922088623,2.1094400882720947,1.698169469833374,4.108520030975342,2.4853153228759766,2.291501045227051,2.7318525314331055,3.1114444732666016,2.188948392868042,2.1835062503814697,1.3757665157318115,3.4135141372680664,3.3703083992004395,4.467998027801514,2.092076301574707,1.5383541584014893,3.136509895324707,4.497023582458496,4.128657341003418,3.4574224948883057,3.380263090133667,3.5985488891601562,1.8038859367370605,1.5595946311950684,1.3458372354507446,2.7654213905334473,2.913972854614258,3.5846517086029053,3.385554075241089,3.1393792629241943,3.1552224159240723,4.200373649597168,1.5976824760437012,2.3932907581329346,1.3791663646697998,3.0910606384277344,3.915040969848633,3.473480463027954,1.3955522775650024,3.3305230140686035,1.8636990785598755,2.423411369323

data' and the use of 'Artificial Intelligence' (AI) is currently advancing due to the increasing and even cheaper data collection and processing capabilities. Social and economical change is predicted by numerous company leaders, politicians and researchers. Machine and Deep Learning (ML\\u002fDL) are sub-types of AI, which are gaining high interest within the community of data scientists and engineers worldwide. Obviously, this global trend does not stop at structural glass engineering, so that, the first part of the present paper is concerned with introducing the basic theoretical frame of AI and its sub-classes of ML and DL while the specific needs and requirements for the application in a structural engineering context are highlighted. Then this paper explores potential applications of AI for different subjects within the design, verification and monitoring of facades and glass structures. Finally, the current status of research as well as successfully conducted industry projects by the authors are presented. The discussion of specific problems ranges from supervised ML in case of the material parameter identification of polymeric interlayers used in laminated glass or the prediction of cut-edge strength based on the process parameters of a glass cutting machine and prediction of fracture patterns of tempered glass to the application of computer vision DL methods to image classification of the Pummel test and the use of semantic segmentation for the detection of cracks at the cut edge of glass. In the summary and conclusion section, the main findings for the applicability and impact of AI for the presented structural glass research and industry problems are compiled. It can be seen that in many cases AI, data, software and computing resources are already available today to successfully implement AI projects in the glass industry, which is demonstrated by the many current examples mentioned. Future research directories however will need to concentrate on how to introduce further glass-specific theoretical and human expert knowledge in the AI training process on the one hand and on the other hand more pronunciation has to be laid on the thorough digitization of workflows associated with the structural glass problem at hand in order to foster the further use of AI within this domain in both research and industry.\",\"Building energy retrofit has a significant role in achieving clean energy goals in the United States, creating a vast construction market. The initial step to improving energy efficiency is a detailed building inspection. However, building inspections are often time-consuming and not scalable. Therefore, the application of drone thermography, which can be used to create digital geometry, is explored for an automated building inspection. This application has the advantages of reducing time, labor, and safety concerns for inspection activities while solving problems of inaccessible building envelope components. Consequently, we used Infrared Thermal cameras installed on an Unmanned Aerial System to collect thermal images from building sites. The proposed workflow was started with designing a drone flight path for data collection, followed by implementing computer vision algorithms to analyze the data to identify thermal anomalies of building envelope. The paper examined a campus building in Syracuse, New York. Thermal anomalies related to cases of beam to wall thermal bridge, material degradation, and air leakage were successfully detected for the case study. Additionally, the proposed approach may be integrated with building simulation toward enriching building energy assessment. This study contributes to solve problems associated with productivity in the construction sector and to improve commercial inspection efficiency.\",\"Building facade inspection and maintenance needs to be carried out periodically, and the detection of cracks is a core component of the inspection process. The current inspection procedure is labor-intensive and time-consuming and poses significant safety issues like falling from height. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with computer vision techniques represent a promising approach for visual crack inspection on high-rise building facades. One research challenge to achieving automated visual crack inspection is image degradation in the form of motion blur caused by UAVs during image acquisition. Motion blur arises due to excessive vibrations of the UAV platform, and this may adversely affect crack detection. In this paper, a deep learning-based deblurring model based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed to address this challenge. Further, by recognizing a strong correlation between blurred and sharpened crack images, the idea of using a localized skip connection is introduced. Experimental validation of the proposed deblurring model is carried out by investigating the impact of skip connections on deblurring. The proposed model is also compared against the state-of-the-art deblurring model, and results indicate that the proposed model is able to achieve significant improvements in deblurring performance in terms of both global structure and feature details in crack images.\",\"This paper discusses the automatic texturing of building facades from thermal infrared image sequences. A fully automatic method is presented to refine GPS based positions estimating relative orientations of the image sequences including a given building model in a bundle adjustment process. The resulting refined orientation parameters are used to extract partial facade textures from all images and all sequences. The resulting partial textures of every sequence are combined to get complete facade textures in the thermal infrared domain. Textures from different image sequences are combined for object detection and extraction. These sequences are acquired either at different times for different radiometric thermal behavior of facade objects or with different viewing directions for objects located before or behind the facade plane.\",\"Methods employed for surveying buildings for condition have traditionally been reliant upon visual assessment and manual recording. Survey of traditional masonry also ostensibly conforms to this approach but, due to the sheer volume of masonry units composing walls, it is often prohibitively time consuming, exceptionally complex and ultimately costly. Notable features of such survey work for ashlar stone types require each stone to be labelled and overlaid with information relative to condition. Further hindering these already costly operations, it has been shown that the accuracy of reporting, including labelling the manifestation of defects and defect diagnosis, is subjective, depending upon the expertise and experience of those evaluating the fabric. Moving beyond these preliminary survey and reporting stages, this situation gives rise to variable repair and maintenance strategies that can have significant cost implications and can debase fundamental conservation activities. The development of digital technologies, such as terrestrial laser scanning, and advancements in novel computer vision statistical techniques can help produce accurate representation of buildings that can be subsequently rapidly processed, achieving many tangible survey functions with greater inherent objectivity. In this paper, an innovative strategy for automatic detection and classification of defects in digitised ashlar masonry walling is presented. The classification method is based on the use of supervised machine learning algorithms, assisted by surveyors' strategies and expertise to identify defective individual masonry units, through to broader global patterns for groups of stones. The proposed approach has been tested on the main facade of the Chapel Royal in Stirling Castle (Scotland), demonstrating its potential for ashlar masonry forms of wall construction. It is important to recognise that the findings are not limited to this culturally significant building and will be of high value to almost innumerable ashlar-built structures worldwide. The research ultimately attempts to reduce the degree of subjectivity in classifying defects, on a scale and rapidity hitherto beyond traditional project cost constraints. Importantly, it is recognised that through automation more effective utilisation of resources that would have been traditionally spent on survey can be redeployed to support fabric intervention or routine maintenance operations.\",\"Oblique aerial images offer views of both building roofs and facades, and thus have been recognized as a potential source to detect severe building damages caused by destructive disaster events such as earthquakes. Therefore, they represent an important source of information for first responders or other stakeholders involved in the post-disaster response process. Several automated methods based on supervised learning have already been demonstrated for damage detection using oblique airborne images. However, they often do not generalize well when data from new unseen sites need to be processed, hampering their practical use. Reasons for this limitation include image and scene characteristics, though the most prominent one relates to the image features being used for training the classifier. Recently features based on deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been shown to be more effective than conventional hand-crafted features, and have become the state-of-the-art in many domains, including remote sensing. Moreover, often oblique images are captured with high block overlap, facilitating the generation of dense 3D point clouds - an ideal source to derive geometric characteristics. We hypothesized that the use of CNN features, either independently or in combination with 3D point cloud features, would yield improved performance in damage detection. To this end we used CNN and 3D features, both independently and in combination, using images from manned and unmanned aerial platforms over several geographic locations that vary significantly in terms of image and scene characteristics. A multiple-kernel-learning framework, an effective way for integrating features from different modalities, was used for combining the two sets of features for classification. The results are encouraging: while CNN features produced an average classification accuracy of about 91%, the integration of 3D point cloud features led to an additional improvement of about 3% (i.e. an average classification accuracy of 94%). The significance of 3D point cloud features becomes more evident in the model transferability scenario (i.e., training and testing samples from different sites that vary slightly in the aforementioned characteristics), where the integration of CNN and 3D point cloud features significantly improved the model transferability accuracy up to a maximum of 7% compared with the accuracy achieved by CNN features alone. Overall, an average accuracy of 85% was achieved for the model transferability scenario across all experiments. Our main conclusion is that such an approach qualifies for practical use.\",\"Cracks in building facades are inevitable due to the age of the building. Cracks found in the building facade may be further exacerbated if not corrected immediately. Considering the extensive size of some buildings, there is definitely a need to automate the inspection routine to facilitate the inspection process. The incorporation of deep learning technology for the classification of images has proven to be an effective method in many past civil infrastructures like pavements and bridges. There is, however, limited research in the built environment sector. In order to align with the Smart Nation goals of the country, the use of Smart technologies is necessary in the building and construction industry. The focus of the study is to identify the effectiveness of deep learning technology for image classification. Deep learning technology, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), requires a large amount of data in order to obtain good performance. It is, however, difficult to collect the images manually. This study will cover the transfer learning approach, where image classification can be carried out even with limited data. Using the CNN method achieved an accuracy level of about 89%, while using the transfer learning model achieved an accuracy of 94%. Based on this, it can be concluded that the transfer learning method achieves better performance as compared to the CNN method with the same amount of data input.\",\"The article focuses on utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to capture and classify building facades of various forms of cultural sites and structures. We propose a Pareto-optimized deep learning algorithm for building detection and classification in a congested urban environment. Outdoor image processing becomes difficult in typical European metropolitan situations due to dynamically changing weather conditions as well as various objects obscuring perspectives (wires, overhangs, posts, other building parts, etc.), therefore, we also investigated the influence of such ambient noise. The approach was tested on 8768 UAV photographs shot at different angles and aimed at very different 611 buildings in the city of Vilnius (Wilno). The total accuracy was 98.41% in clear view settings, 88.11% in rain, and 82.95% when the picture was partially blocked by other objects and in the shadows. The algorithm's robustness was also tested on the Harward UAV dataset containing images of buildings taken from above (roofs) while our approach was trained using images taken at an angle (facade still visible). Our approach was still able to achieve acceptable 88.6% accuracy in building detection, yet the network showed lower accuracy when assigning the correct facade class as images lacked necessary facade information.\",\"IRT (Infrared Thermography) is a commonly used non-destructive testing method for detecting thermal anomalies of a building envelope that may cause heat loss and occupant discomfort. Despite its importance, a thermal anomaly is still usually detected by manual analysis of IRT, which strongly depends on the analyzer?s experience. In this study, an automatic anomaly detection framework from thermal and visible images was developed. The wall, which is the subject of anomaly detection, is segmented from the visible image by a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). The temperature threshold of the anomaly area is determined from the multimodal temperature distribution of the target domain. The performance of the anomaly detection was improved by applying the segmentation process (F1 score 0.497 to 0.808). The framework proposed in this study is expected to be implemented through portable devices and enable instant in-situ thermal anomaly detection.\",\"In the United States, buildings' heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems account for approximately 40% of the global energy consumption, and contribute between 40% and 48% of the CO2 emissions. One of the largest causes for this type of energy consumption is heat loss. Energy loss can be attributed to inefficiency and sub-surface defects in the structure that reduce the thermal resistance and facilitate unwanted heat transmission within the environment. In recent years, infrared (IR) thermography has proven to be an excellent tool for detecting heat loss from a building envelope. At the same time, advancements in computer vision systems have enabled the use of Structure from Motion (SfM) as a photogrammetry technique. SfM is used for the generation of three-dimensional (3D) building information modeling (BIM). It has the potential to facilitate remote visual inspection of large-scale structures and infrastructure systems by creating virtual renderings. The results of an experiment performed on a lab-scale building using both IR and SfM techniques is analyzed. In particular, the accuracy of SfM in generating a 3D virtual rendering of a target object by using images acquired from a low-cost IR camera is discussed. IR images of a building are recorded and are used for reconstructing a digital model of the structure. The goal is to characterize the viability of SfM in detecting sub-surface defects that can yield to significant heat loss and reduce thermal efficiency in the facade of the building.\",\"Graffiti is common in many communities and even affects our historical and heritage structures. This leads to a decrease in the revenue associated with commercial activities or services (e.g., shops, restaurants, residences), and potentially reduces tourism in a region. Visual data, in the form of photographs, is becoming an efficient mechanism to record information. Photographs can be quickly captured, and are already frequently posted online by ordinary citizens (e.g., tourists, residents, visitors). Exploiting image data through automation and computer vision provides a new opportunity to simplify the current manual graffiti-monitoring processes, enabling automated detection, localization, and quantification of such markings. In this study, we developed a vision-based graffiti-detection technique using a convolutional neural network. Images collected from historical structures of interest within a community can be utilized to automatically inspect for graffiti markings. In the case in which citizens collect and contribute data, there is a high degree of duplication and repetition, and potentially a lack of GPS information. These hinder the direct use of the images for automating the process. To address these challenges, we built high-resolution, single-view facade images (orthophotos) before applying our robust graffiti detector. The robust graffiti detector was built using a database with 1022 images of damaged or contaminated structures gathered during a recent European Union project, entitled Safeguarding Cultural Heritage through Technical and Organisational Resources Management (STORM). A total of 818 images were used for training (10% of the training set was randomly chosen for the validation set), achieving 88% accuracy among the remaining 204 samples for testing. Using the trained detector, the technique developed was demonstrated using data collected from the Church of Agios Nikolaos (Leontariou), Kantza, Greece.\",\"High moisture content is a common problem of adhered glazed ceramic cladding. It leads to further problems such as biological growth, delamination and efflorescence. Increased moisture also affects users' indoor comfort and more energy is needed for heating due to higher thermal conductivity. Therefore, it is useful to detect it before visible signs occur and this is possible with infrared thermography. A quasi-quantitative approach based on time-dependent infrared thermographic inspection and thermogram analysis by quantitative methods was tested in an adhered ceramic facade where rising damp had already been identified. Simple image subtraction (SIS), nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and principal component analysis (PCA) were the quantitative methods tested for the analysis of thermograms. Hammer-tapping control and surface moisture measurements were the auxiliary techniques used to assess the results. Comparative assessments showed that the quasi-quantitative approach using PCA has great potential to detect changes in moisture and also to eliminate false indications caused by unavoidable reflection and shading. The results obtained by SIS and NMF on the other hand, had limited performance in showing areas with high moisture content. \",\"As a transparent and traditional building material, glass products such as glass facade are vital components of buildings. However, the surface scratches generated in the manufacturing process or emerging in the service stage such as windborne debris impacts may lead to remarkable strength degradation of glass material. In order to assess the fracture possibility of glass components, the size and number of scratches should be monitored during their lifecycle. Automatic scratch detection of architectural glass therefore remains a necessary task for civil engineers. A pixel-level instance segmentation model using Mask and region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) was proposed for scratches detection on transparent glass surface. Images with scratches were firstly collected by a tailor-made automated microscopic camera scanning system to build the training and validation dataset. Test results demonstrate that the trained network is satisfactory, achieving a mean average precision of 96.5% with low missing and false rate under background interference. A comparison between the proposed model and another segmentation method YOLACT indicates that the proposed model has better performance in both detection and segmentation accuracy. The proposed deep learning-based approach can better support the development of non-contact defect assessment techniques for transparent building materials such as glass.\",\"One of the most common pathologies in exposed brick facades is efflorescence, which, although they often have a similar appearance, their effects and way of solving them can range from a one-off cleaning to a repair that involves adding or replacing the material. Therefore, the novel goal of this work is to verify whether it is possible to automate this task of distinguishing what type of intervention each brick needs. To do this, the methodology followed focuses on proposing, training and validating a deep convolutional neural network with the real-time end-to-end method that simultaneously predicts multiple bounding boxes and class probabilities for those boxes. For this, images of 765 building facades will be used, of which 392 were selected, proceeding to label 4704 bricks, resulting in that the model achieved a mAP maximum at epoch 100 with 0.894, which is therefore of interest for the creation of intervention maps.\",\"Structural disaster damage detection and characterisation is one of the oldest remote sensing challenges, and the utility of virtually every type of active and passive sensor deployed on various air- and spaceborne platforms has been assessed. The proliferation and growing sophistication of UAV in recent years has opened up many new opportunities for damage mapping, due to the high spatial resolution, the resulting stereo images and derivatives, and the flexibility of the platform. We have addressed the problem in the context of two European research projects, RECONASS and INACHUS. In this paper we synthesize and evaluate the progress of 6 years of research focused on advanced image analysis that was driven by progress in computer vision, photogrammetry and machine learning, but also by constraints imposed by the needs of first responder and other civil protection end users. The projects focused on damage to individual buildings caused by seismic activity but also explosions, and our work centred on the processing of 3D point cloud information acquired from stereo imagery. Initially focusing on the development of both supervised and unsupervised damage detection methods built on advanced texture features and basic classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Random Forest, the work moved on to the use of deep learning. In particular the coupling of image-derived features and 3D point cloud information in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) proved successful in detecting also subtle damage features. In addition to the detection of standard rubble and debris, CNN-based methods were developed to detect typical facade damage indicators, such as cracks and spalling, including with a focus on multi-temporal and multi-scale feature fusion. We further developed a processing pipeline and mobile app to facilitate near-real time damage mapping. The solutions were tested in a number of pilot experiments and evaluated by a variety of stakeholders.\",\"Crack detection in masonry facades is a crucial task for ensuring the safety and longevity of buildings. However, traditional methods are often time-consuming, expensive, and labourintensive. In recent years, deep learning techniques have been applied to detect cracks in masonry images, but these models often require large amounts of annotated data to achieve high accuracy, which can be difficult to obtain. In this article, we propose a deep learning approach for crack detection on brickwork masonry facades using transfer learning with limited annotated data. Our approach uses a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network model as a feature extractor, which is then optimised specifically for crack detection. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we created and curated a dataset of 700 brickwork masonry facade images, and used 500 images for training, 100 for validation, and the remaining 100 images for testing. Results showed that our approach is very effective in detecting cracks, achieving an accuracy and F1-score of up to 100% when following end-to-end training of the neural network, thus being a promising solution for building inspection and maintenance, particularly in situations where annotated data is limited. Moreover, the transfer learning approach can be easily adapted to different types of masonry facades, making it a versatile tool for building inspection and maintenance.\",\"Accurate assessment of building damage is very important for disaster response and rescue. Traditional damage detection techniques using 2D features at a single observing angle cannot objectively and accurately reflect the structural damage conditions. With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetric techniques and 3D point processing, automatic and accurate damage detection for building roof and facade has become a research hotspot in recent work. In this paper, we propose a building damage detection framework based on the boundary refined supervoxel segmentation and random forest-latent Dirichlet allocation classification. First, the traditional supervoxel segmentation method is improved to segment the point clouds into good boundary refined supervoxels. Then, non-building points such as ground and vegetation are removed from the generated supervoxels. Next, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model is used to construct the high-level feature representation for each building supervoxel based on the selected 2D image and 3D point features. Finally, LDA model and random forest algorithm are employed to identify the damaged building regions. This method is applied to oblique photogrammetric point clouds collected from the Beichuan Country Earthquake Site. The research achieves the 3D damage assessment for building facade and roof. The result demonstrates that the proposed framework is capable of achieving around 94% accuracy for building point extraction and around 90% accuracy for damage identification. Moreover, both of the precision and recall for building damage detection reached around 89%. Concluded from comparison analysis, the proposed method improved the damage detection accuracy and the highest improvement ratio is over 8%.\",\"Visual evaluation of facade condition plays an important role to ensure the structural health of the whole building. To automatically achieve visual evaluation of facade condition with high accuracy, current studies have applied various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to classify, localize, and segment the defects. However, the methods in previous research mainly focused on accuracy improvement rather than providing effective evaluations of defects according to the requirement of industry standards. Therefore, this study proposes a rule-based deep learning method to achieve evaluation-oriented facade defects detection, which can be used to provide effective evaluation areas containing the necessary information (e.g., type, location, quantity, and size of facade defects) for condition evaluation. First, annotation rules for classification, segmentation, and localization are designed to instruct the manual annotation work and automatically adjust the bounding boxes into effective evaluation areas. Then, a proposal weighting rule is developed to be combined with the deep learning model during the model training process to improve the accuracy and stability of the predictions. A rectification rule is further used to adjust the raw predictions into predictions with effective evaluation areas for facade defects. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrated that using the proposed method can successfully improve the performance of facade defects detection to meet the requirement of condition evaluation. Besides, this method is tested to be adaptable to various distance settings in the requirement.\",\"Wood is considered one of the most important construction materials, as well as a natural material prone to degradation, with fungi being the main reason for wood failure in a temperate climate. Visual inspection of wood or other approaches for monitoring are time-consuming, and the incipient stages of decay are not always visible. Thus, visual decay detection and such manual monitoring could be replaced by automated real-time monitoring systems. The capabilities of such systems can range from simple monitoring, periodically reporting data, to the automatic detection of anomalous measurements that may happen due to various environmental or technical reasons. In this paper, we explore the application of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) techniques to wood Moisture Content (MC) data. Specifically, data were obtained from a wood construction that was monitored for four years using sensors at different positions. Our experimental results prove the validity of these techniques to detect both artificial and real anomalies in MC signals, encouraging further research to enable their deployment in real use cases.\",\"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently become popular in building facade inspections to maintain a safe and well-performed built environment. A camera-equipped UAV system can capture numerous high-resolution facade images for close-up visual inspections. However, in several cases, the multispectrum and spatiotemporal data collected by UAVs are not systematically documented and utilized, which obstructs the automation in the identification, localization, assessment, and tracking of facade anomalies. This paper develops an integrated, computational GIS-based information system to provide automated storage, retrieval, detection, assessment, and documentation of facade anomalies based on UAV-captured data. The developed system creates user-friendly access to diverse professional imagery analysis tools from external artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. A real-world case was studied to present the procedure and advances in the management and analysis of multisourced inspection data to automate UAV-based facade diagnosis. As a result, the proposed method facilitates the seamless fusion, processing, visualization, and documentation of multimodal inspection data, resulting in convenient analysis with discrepancies measured in decimeters for length, millimeters for width, and centimeters for geoposition. This contributes to the understanding of facade conditions and decision-making of timely maintenance throughout a building's service lifecycle.\",\"Cracks are pathologies whose appearance in ceramic tiles can cause various damages due to the coating system losing water tightness and impermeability functions. Besides, the detachment of a ceramic plate, exposing the building structure, can still reach people who move around the building. Manual inspection is the most common method for addressing this problem. However, it depends on the knowledge and experience of those who perform the analysis and demands a long time and a high cost to map the entire area. This work focuses on automated optical inspection to find faults in ceramic tiles performing the segmentation of cracks in ceramic images using deep learning to segment these defects. We propose an architecture for segmenting cracks in facades with Deep Learning that includes an image pre-processing step. We also propose the Ceramic Crack Database, a set of images to segment defects in ceramic tiles. The proposed model can adequately identify the crack even when it is close to or within the grout.\",\"Featured Application The method proposed in this paper is suitable for application in the condition assessment of inaccessible building facades or high-rise and large structures of all kinds. Building facade assessment could be performed in a more efficient way using a multidisciplinary approach and modern technologies. This study proposes the orthofacade-based assisted inspection method (AIM), universal and applicable to different types of facade cladding and suitable for application in the condition assessment of inaccessible building facades or high-rise and large structures of all kinds. The AIM method offers a multidisciplinary approach by combining unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, electronic tachymetry, and digital image processing techniques (photogrammetry and open-source computer vision methods). The method was verified in a case study performed on a high-rise building facade. On-site data acquisition of high-resolution images of facade and control points was conducted by UAV and tachymetry. The data were further processed in photogrammetric software in order to generate a georeferenced orthofacade. Crack detection was performed at pixel level via computer code using the OpenCV library methods. The established diagnostic model, defined by control points, enables precise determination of crack location. Crack length, width, or area could be calculated based on the coordinates of its points, by performing simple mathematical operations. The AIM method provides automation of crack detection and precise determination of location and geometrical parameters of detected crack.\",\"In order for a risk assessment to deliver sensible results, exposure in the concerned area must be known or at least estimated in a reliable manner. Exposure estimation, though, may be tricky, especially in urban areas, where large-scale surveying is generally expensive and impractical; yet, it is in urban areas that most assets are at stake when a disaster strikes. Authoritative sources such as cadastral data and business records may not be readily accessible to private stakeholders such as insurance companies; airborne and especially satellite-based Earth-Observation data obviously cannot retrieve all relevant pieces of information. Recently, a growing interest is recorded in the exploitation of street-level pictures, procured either through crowdsourcing or through specialized services like Google Street View. Pictures of building facades convey a great amount of information, but their interpretation is complex. Recently, however, smarter image analysis methods based on deep learning started appearing in literature, made possible by the increasing availability of computational power. In this paper, we leverage such methods to design a system for large-scale, systematic scanning of street-level pictures intended to map floor numbers in urban buildings. Although quite simple, this piece of information is a relevant exposure proxy in risk assessment. In the proposed system, a series of georeferenced images are automatically retrieved from the repository where they sit. A tailored deep learning net is first trained on sample images tagged through visual interpretation, and then systematically applied to the entire retrieved dataset. A specific algorithm allows attaching number of floors tags to the correct building in a dedicated GIS (Geographic Information System) layer, which is finally output by the system as an exposure proxy layer.\",\"Facade tiles of buildings are likely to weaken, crack, or fall off due to aging or out of natural causes such as temperature variations during daytime and nighttime and earthquakes. Tile spalling of tall buildings often leads to accidents or even severe casualties. In view that a routine thorough inspection is costly, this study aims to develop a cost-effective means to detect facade tile degradation of tall buildings through machine learning. We leverage a drone to film outer walls of high-rise buildings at several dozens of sites, from which training data are produced for learning and validation. We resort to a convolutional neural network with deep learning capabilities that is trained with sufficient knowledge to identify hazardous conditions of cracked tiles in two or three levels. Core to our implementation is Jetson TX2-an embedded system-which is programmed in light of AlexNet over Keras and TensorFlow, opensource libraries for deep neural network programming. To heighten learning quality subject to limited amount of training data, image preprocessing involving gray-level transformation, thresholding, and morphological operations is introduced. Experimental results corroborate that our scheme achieves a correct classification rate of over 86%. Our development serves a moderate approach to deep learning in daily contexts, a practical scenario over which to inspire other applications.\",\"There is a growing trend in the application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems for visual inspection of building facades. Current practices remain at a low efficiency to manage the large amount of UAV-collected close-range facade images to support the inspection and documentation of facade anomalies such as cracks and corrosions. This paper proposes a GIS-based two-step procedure to streamline the process of the management of UAV-collected images for supporting building facade inspection. First, a 2D GIS spatial model of building facades is created by net-unfolding facade surfaces around the building footprint in GIS to store the geometric and geographic information of building facades. Then, the UAV-collected images are automatically geo-registered to the 2D GIS spatial model through computer vision techniques applied in GIS. An experimental case study is also presented to demonstrate the process and evaluate the performance of the proposed method. It is demonstrated that the GIS-based spatial model of net-unfolded building facades allows for an efficient and effective registration of UAV-captured close-range facade images without apparent loss of pixel data. Provided with image data processing capabilities to detect and assess facade anomalies, the proposed GIS-based workflow can contribute to an automated documentation of UAV-based facade inspections to support the decision-making of further maintenance actions.\",\"Remote sensing images have long been recognized as useful for the detection of building damages, mainly due to their wide coverage, revisit capabilities and high spatial resolution. The majority of contributions aimed at identifying debris and rubble piles, as the main focus is to assess collapsed and partially collapsed structures. However, these approaches might not be optimal for the image classification of facade damages, where damages might appear in the form of spalling, cracks and collapse of small segments of the facade. A few studies focused their damage detection on the facades using only post-event images. Nonetheless, several studies achieved better performances in damage detection approaches when considering multi-temporal image data. Hence, in this work a multi-temporal facade damage detection is tested. The first objective is to optimally merge pre- and post-event aerial oblique imagery within a supervised classification approach using convolutional neural networks to detect facade damages. The second objective is related to the fact that facades are normally depicted in several views in aerial manned photogrammetric surveys; hence, different procedures combining these multi-view image data are also proposed and embedded in the image classification approach. Six multi-temporal approaches are compared against 3 mono-temporal ones. The results indicate the superiority of multi-temporal approaches (up to similar to 25% in f1-score) when compared to the mono-temporal ones. The best performing multi-temporal approach takes as input sextuples (3 views per epoch, per facade) within a late fusion approach to perform the image classification of facade damages. However, the detection of small damages, such as smaller cracks or smaller areas of spalling, remains challenging in this approach, mainly due to the low resolution (similar to 0.14 m ground sampling distance) of the dataset used.\",\"Despite advanced construction technologies that are unceasingly filling the city-skylines with glassy high-rise structures, maintenance of these shining tall monsters has remained a high-risk labor-intensive process. Thus, nowadays, utilizing fa ade-cleaning robots seems inevitable. However, in case of navigating on cracked glass, these robots may cause hazardous situations. Accordingly, it seems necessary to equip them with crack-detection system to eventually avoid cracked area. In this study, benefitting from convolutional neural networks developed in TensorFlow (TM), a deep-learning-based crack detection approach is introduced for a novel modular facade-cleaning robot. For experimental purposes, the robot is equipped with an on-board camera and the live video is loaded using OpenCV. The vision-based training process is fulfilled by applying two different optimizers utilizing a sufficiently generalized data-set. Data augmentation techniques and also image pre-processing also apply as a part of process. Simulation and experimental results show that the system can hit the milestone on crack-detection with an accuracy around 90%. This is satisfying enough to replace human-conducted on-site inspections. In addition, a thorough comparison between the performance of optimizers is put forward: Adam optimizer shows higher precision, while Adagrad serves more satisfying recall factor, however, Adam optimizer with the lowest false negative rate and highest accuracy has a better performance. Furthermore, proposed CNN's performance is compared to traditional NN and the results provide a remarkable difference in success level, proving the strength of CNN.\",\"Targeted energy management and control is becoming an increasing concern in the building sector. Automatic analyses of thermal data, which minimize the subjectivity of the assessment and allow for large-scale inspections, are therefore of high interest. In this study, we propose an approach for a supervised extraction of facade openings (windows and doors) from photogrammetric 3D point clouds attributed to RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) information. The novelty of the proposed approach is in the combination of thermal information with other available characteristics of data for a classification performed directly in 3D space. Images acquired in visible and thermal infrared spectra serve as input data for the camera pose estimation and the reconstruction of 3D scene geometry. To investigate the relevance of different information types to the classification performance, a Random Forest algorithm is applied to various sets of computed features. The best feature combination is then used as an input for a Conditional Random Field that enables us to incorporate contextual information and consider the interaction between the points. The evaluation executed on a per-point level shows that the fusion of all available information types together with context consideration allows us to extract objects with 90% completeness and 95% correctness. A respective assessment executed on a per-object level shows 97% completeness and 88% accuracy.\",\"This paper describes a new concept to automatically characterize building types in urban areas based on publicly available image databases, making parts of seismic risk assessment more time and cost-effective, and improving the reliability of seismic risk assessment, especially in regions where building stock information is currently not documented. One of the main steps in evaluating potential human and economic losses in a seismic risk assessment, is the development of inventory databases for existing building stocks in terms of load-resisting structural systems and material characteristics (building typologies classification). The common approach for building stock model classification is to perform extensive fieldwork and walk-down surveys in representative areas of a city, and in some cases using random sample surveys of geounits. This procedure is time and cost consuming, and subject to personal interpretation: to mitigate these costs, we have introduced a machine learning methodology to automate this classification based on publicly available image databases. We here use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically identify the different building typologies in the city of Oslo, Norway, based on facade images taken from in-situ fieldwork and from Google Street View. We use transfer learning of state-of-the-art pretrained CNNs to predict the Model Building Typology. The present article attempts to categorize Oslo's building stock in five main building typologies: timber, unreinforced masonry, reinforced concrete, composite (steel-reinforced concrete) and steel. This method results in 89% accuracy score for timber buildings, though only 35% success score for steel-reinforced concrete buildings. We here classify and define for the first time a relevant set of five typologies for the Norwegian building typologies as observed in Oslo and applicable at national level. In addition, this study shows that CNNs can significantly contribute in terms of developing a cost-effective building stock model.\",\"This study proposes a novel bounding-box object augmentation (BoxAug) method to improve the performance of deep learning models in detecting defects in residential building facades. The most significant characteristic of the method is that it augments objects in images, rather than augmenting images, to solve the data imbalance problem. Moreover, it employs the bounding-box form for object detection, instead of the segmentation mask form. To evaluate the method, 7635 images obtained using unmanned aerial vehicles were utilized as the original training dataset. The faster region-based convolutional neural network model trained with the augmented training dataset using the method exhibited better performance than the model trained with the original dataset. Particularly, the class with the least objects in the original dataset displayed a markedly improved performance. Thus, the method can serve as an auxiliary method for effectively augmenting real-world image datasets with an unbalanced number of objects.\",\"Building structural type information is the foundation for seismic risk assessment and management since it reflects the behavior of buildings under seismic load. However, in earthquake-prone regions, most of this information is out-of-date or nonexistent. This paper proposes a deep learning-based method for automatically identifying building structural types from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) oblique images. The method consists of four steps: (1) collect facades of buildings with different structural types by web crawler technology as a sample set; (2) construct a convolutional neural network with a facade prior knowledge attention branch and train the model using the sample set; (3) extract building facades from UAV oblique images based on the georeferencing results of feature points as the test set; (4) identify building structural types by inputting the test set into the trained model. Three cases have been selected to verify the feasibility and applicability of the method. The average recall rate of 85% and the average F1 score of 83% have been achieved in areas with regular building distribution. This method integrates multidisciplinary knowledge to provide a solution for rapid collection of building vulnerability information, and expands the role of oblique photography data in urban management and disaster prevention planning.\",\"Defects in residential building facades affect the structural integrity of buildings and degrade external appearances. Defects in a building facade are typically managed using manpower during maintenance. This approach is time-consuming, yields subjective results, and can lead to accidents or casualties. To address this, we propose a building facade monitoring system that utilizes an object detection method based on deep learning to efficiently manage defects by minimizing the involvement of manpower. The dataset used for training a deep-learning-based network contains actual residential building facade images. Various building designs in these raw images make it difficult to detect defects because of their various types and complex backgrounds. We employed the faster regions with convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) structure for more accurate defect detection in such environments, achieving an average precision (intersection over union (IoU) = 0.5) of 62.7% for all types of trained defects. As it is difficult to detect defects in a training environment, it is necessary to improve the performance of the network. However, the object detection network employed in this study yields an excellent performance in complex real-world images, indicating the possibility of developing a system that would detect defects in more types of building facades.\",\"Building inspection is a critical issue for designing rehabilitation projects, which are recently gaining importance for environmental and energy efficiency reasons. Image sensors on-board unmanned aerial vehicles are a powerful tool for building inspection, given the diversity and complexity of facades and materials, and mainly, their vertical disposition. The UBRISTES (UAV-based Building Rehabilitation with vISible and ThErmal infrared remote Sensing) system is proposed as an effective solution for facade inspection in urban areas, validating a method for the simultaneous acquisition of visible and thermal aerial imaging applied to the detection of the main types of facade anomalies\\u002fpathologies, and showcasing its possibilities using a first principles analysis. Two public buildings have been considered for evaluating the proposed system. UBRISTES is ready to use in building inspection and has been proved as a useful tool in the design of rehabilitation projects for inaccessible, complex building structures in the context of energy efficiency.\",\"Manual inspections of glass facade of high rising buildings are expensive, time-consuming and potentially life-threatening for both inspectors and pedestrians on the street. Advances in machine learning for image\\u002fvideo analysis and availability of affordable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with onboard video recording and processing sensors provide opportunities for smart, safe and automatic glass facade inspections. This paper is concerned with developing an effective solution for recognizing cracked glass panels, which can be installed on board a UAV. From static 2D photographic images, the proposed solution analyzes textural patterns of smooth glass surface and crack segments, linearity of detected crack segments, geometrical characteristics of crack curvatures and the crack pixel patterns, captures these discriminative features for glass cracks using Uniform Local Binary Pattern (ULBP), histograms of linearity, geometrical curvature descriptors with fixed length connected pixel configurations, and accordingly classifies images of cracked and non-cracked glass panels using a kNN classifier. Experimental results with images of different resolutions acquired by a UAV drone in a real office building setting and images collected through Google search demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves promising results with accuracy rates in excess of 80% and even as high as 91% despite the presence of reflections.\",\"Most current research deals with line following at an aerial position with respect to the target object. We address a task scenario of close-up inspection on vertical surfaces. Line following is a basic component for the close-up inspection process on high rise structures, such as building facade, tower skeleton, and wind turbine blade. The inspection process may also require slower and accurate line following movement for anomaly detection in higher resolution. In this paper, we formulate the problem of accurate line following on vertical surfaces. We propose the carrot in probabilistic grid algorithm for accurate line following on vertical surfaces and work through a refinement for performance improvement. We implemented the carrot in probabilistic grid algorithm on a ready-to-fly quadrotor (micro rotary UAV) and evaluated the line following performance with several forms of geometric line segments on a vertical surface. Experimental results based on extensive actual flight tests show satisfactory performance of the carrot in probabilistic grid algorithm over the benchmark line following algorithm.\",\"Facade defect classification based on deep learning has made great progresses in recent years. However, deep learning models commonly need abundant labeled data for training, and it could be impractical and expensive to collect sufficient labeled samples for all classes of defects. Sometimes, there are only a few samples in rare classes, which are not able to support the training process. In addition, common classifiers based on deep learning cannot easily extend their recognition classes and thus cannot classify unseen classes with only a few samples. Therefore, to overcome the problem of insufficient data and the extension constraint of the classifier, a few-shot classification method based on an extensible classifier and contrastive learning is proposed to recognize unseen classes with limited (1, 2 or 5) samples. The extensible classifier implemented by imprinting weights can easily extend the model to classify unseen classes with a few samples. Meanwhile, contrastive learning, which is a complementary task in training, is used to enrich the model's generalization and representation on unseen classes. Besides, a hard negative mining (HNM) method is introduced to address the imbalanced data in contrastive learning and further improve accuracies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the few-shot classification accuracy with only 1 sample from 35.8% to 63.5% on novel and unseen classes, and from 73.1% to 82.1% on all classes, while maintaining a high and comparable accuracy (89.6%) on base classes.\",\"Facade defects not only detract from the building's aesthetics but also compromise its performance. Furthermore, they potentially endanger pedestrians, occupants, and property. Existing deep-learning-based methodologies are facing some challenges in terms of recognition speed and model complexity. An improved YOLOv7 method, named BFD-YOLO, is proposed to ensure the accuracy and speed of building facade defects detection in this paper. Firstly, the original ELAN module in YOLOv7 was substituted with a lightweight MobileOne module to diminish the quantity of parameters and enhance the speed of inference. Secondly, the coordinate attention module was added to the model to enhance feature extraction capability. Next, the SCYLLA-IoU was used to expedite the rate of convergence and increase the recall of the model. Finally, we have extended the open datasets to construct a building facade damage dataset that includes three typical defects. BFD-YOLO demonstrates excellent accuracy and efficiency based on this dataset. Compared to YOLOv7, BFD-YOLO's precision and mAP@.5 are improved by 2.2% and 2.9%, respectively, while maintaining comparable efficiency. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method obtained higher detection accuracy with guaranteed real-time performance.\",\"Many tiles on facade of historic temples are damaged and deteriorated due to aging and environmental factors. Regular inspection is required for proper maintenance and automatic inspection offers a significant advantage over manual inspection as it is efficient and accurate. Many previous studies are focus on detecting damages in factory tiles for the quality control purposes, although there has not been much study on tile damages for historical temples. This paper proposed an image-based system to detect damages in tiles using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on a temple facade. The dataset was created by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and a digital camera from a historical temple in Bangkok, Thailand. In the proposed work, CNN was trained on various image patches sizes. The detection accuracy of the system was found to be 95% in the validation data and 91% on the testing data. The results of the proposed system were compared with a system using hand-crafted features, including 2D wavelet transforms with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The proposed system shows that the CNN approach is more accurate than the traditional handcrafted method.\",\"This paper set out an automatic multicategory damage detection technique using convolutional neural networks (CNN) models based on image classification and features' extraction, to detect damages of historic structures such as: erosion, material loss, color change of the stone, and sabotage issues. The city of Al-Salt in Jordan was selected for the case study in this research. The best model showed an average damage detection accuracy of 95%. It was demonstrated that the proposed CNN model was significantly powerful, effective and reliable for damage detection of historic masonry buildings using features' extraction based on imaging, and it contributed to the management and safety of historic heritage and preservation.\",\"This paper describes a new approach for image-based modeling based on thermographic images and applied to efficiency energy studies of building facades. The approach is automatic and allows obtaining thermographic 3D models and orthoimages, which can be used to assess energy efficiency of building facades. The classical photogrammetry approach is reinforced and combined with computer vision algorithms, especially for the processes of image matching and dense surface generation, so that they have a robust performance with thermographic images. Experimental results presented here demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach using the Polytechnic Advanced School of Avila (Spain) as a case of study. \",\"One common objective in computer vision and photogrammetry is to infer higher level object structure which is not directly observable in images or other sensing data. A practical problem field for such research is seismic building damage assessment. It is possible to observe objects such as facades, roofs, or rubble piles in oblique airborne images, but whether they are part of an actually intact or destroyed building is not observable directly: only the spatial relation between those directly observable objects allows conclusions about the structural integrity of a building. In this paper we present an approach to seismic building damage assessment, where a graph-based learning technique is employed to detect and to classify building damage levels, given instances of four object classes derived by supervised classification in object space. Results show that the vague building damage level description leads to relatively low classification score (52%), when a pre-defined building outline is assumed. However, if one is independent from such a pre-segmentation, the detection and classification rate is higher (70%).\",\"The new Construction 4.0 paradigm takes advantage of existing technologies. In this scope, the development and application of image-based methods for evaluating and monitoring the state of conservation of buildings has shown significant growth, including support for maintenance plans. Recently, powerful algorithms have been applied to automatically evaluate the state of conservation of buildings using deep learning frameworks, which are utilised as a black-box approach. The large amount of data required for training, the difficulty in generalising, and the lack of parameters to assess the quality of the results often make it difficult for non-experts to evaluate them. For several applications and scenarios, simple and more intuitive image-based approaches can be applied to support building inspections. This paper presents the StainView, which is a fast and reliable method. The method is based on the classification of the mosaic image, computed from a systematic acquisition, and allows one to (i) map stains in facades; (ii) locate critical areas; (iii) identify materials; (iv) characterise colours; and (v) produce detailed and comprehensive maps of results. The method was validated in three identical buildings in Bairro de Alvalade, in Lisbon, Portugal, that present different levels of degradation. The comparison with visual inspection demonstrates that StainView enables the automatic location and mapping of critical areas with high efficiency, proving to be a useful tool for building inspection: differences were of approximately 5% for the facade with the worst and average state of conservation, however, the values deteriorate for the facade under good conditions, reaching the double of percentage. In terms of processing speed, StainView allows a facade mapping that is 8-12 times faster, and this difference tends to grow with the number of evaluated facades.\",\"Automated measurement of the relative pose between a crane borne curtain wall module and its installation location on the side face of a high-rise building can be applied to increase the safety and efficiency of crane operations though informing the action required to achieve alignment. However, the detection and measurement tasks are challenging because the construction site is large, unstructured, and highly dynamic. This article introduces a markerless computer vision measurement algorithm and a practical implementation, which uses a forward-facing infrared camera attached to the crane spreader. The algorithm self-verifies the measurement against known information so that it can fail safely instead of returning a malformed measurement. The algorithm is experimentally validated in challenging lighting conditions. The window frame segmentation achieved F-beta = 0.59. Overall, the algorithm returned 71% successful and 0 malformed measurements.\",\"Developments in computer vision, such as structure from motion and multiview stereo reconstruction, have enabled a range of photogrammetric applications using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based imagery. However, some specific cases still present reconstruction challenges, including survey areas composed of steep, overhanging, or vertical rock formations. Here, the suitability and geometric accuracy of four UAV-based image acquisition and data processing scenarios for topographic surveying applications in complex terrain are assessed and compared. The specific cases include the use of: 1) nadir imagery; 2) nadir and oblique imagery; 3) nadir and facade imagery; and 4) nadir, oblique, and facade imagery to reconstruct a topographically complex natural surface. Results illustrate that including oblique and facade imagery to supplement the more traditional nadir collections significantly improves the geometric accuracy of point cloud data reconstruction by approximately 35% when assessed against terrestrial laser scanning data of near-vertical rock walls. Most points (99.41%) had distance errors of less than 50 cm between the point clouds derived from the nadir imagery and nadir-oblique-facade imagery. Apart from delivering enhanced spatial resolution in facade details, the geometric accuracy improvements achieved from integrating nadir, oblique, and facade imagery provide value for a range of applications, including geotechnical and geohazard investigations. Such gains are particularly relevant for studies assessing rock integrity and stability, and engineering design, planning, and construction, where information on the position of rock cracks, joints, faults, shears, and bedding planes may be required.\",\"The increasing number of accidents arising from falling objects from the facade of tall buildings has attracted much attention globally. To regulators, a preventive approach based on a mandatory periodic facade inspection has been deemed as a necessary measure to maintain the functionality and integrity of the facade of tall buildings. Researchers worldwide have been working towards a predictive approach to allow for the assessment of the likely failure during some future period, by measuring the condition of the facade to detect latent defects and anomalies. The methods proposed include laser scanning, image-based sensing and infrared thermography to support the automatic facade visual inspection. This paper aims to review and analyse the state-of-the-art literature on the automated inspection of building facades, with emphasis on the detection and maintenance management of latent defects and anomalies for falling objects from tall buildings. A step-by-step holistic method is leveraged to retrieve the available literature from databases, followed by the analyses of relevant articles in different long-standing research themes. The types and characteristics of facade falling objects, legislations, practices and the effectiveness of various inspection techniques are discussed. Various diagnostic, inspection and analytical methods which support facade inspection and maintenance are analysed with discussion on the potential future research in this field.\",\"Facade inspection is a regular but necessary maintenance task to ensure the safety, functioning, and aesthetics of a building. Traditional visual identification of facade defects is dangerous, time-consuming, and insufficient. Based on an image dataset and deep learning algorithms, an automatic facade defects classification technique is developed in this research. A layer-based categorization rule is proposed to categorize facade defects. To handle the problem of imbalanced data size among defect classes, a meta learning-based method is applied, which reassigns weights to the training data. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed method had a stronger capacity to deal with the imbalanced dataset problem comparing with previous methods by improving the classification accuracy from 71.43% of a basic convolutional neural network (CNN) model to 82.86% of a meta learning-based CNN model.\",\"Developing a classifier to identify the defects from facade images using deep learning requires abundant labeled images. However, it is time-consuming and uneconomical to label the collected images. Hence, it is desired to train an accurate classifier with only a small amount of labeled data. Therefore, this study proposes a semi-supervised learning algorithm that uses only a small amount of labeled data for training, but still achieves high classification accuracy. In addition, based on the mean teacher algorithm, this study develops a novel uncertainty filter to select reliable unlabeled data for initial training epochs to further improve the classification accuracy. Validation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the model accuracy from 79.26% to 84.36% compared to the traditional supervised learning algorithm with 10% of labeled data in a dataset. From another perspective, compared to supervised learning algorithm, the proposed technique can help reduce the time and cost for preparing the labeled data.\",\"Annotation work is burdensome and challenging for developing a facade defects detector, especially when the raw data set is large but not all useful. To alleviate the problem, this study proposes an informativeness-guided active learning methodology to effectively select informative data to train a robust facade defects detector. A novel data annotation workflow is developed to ensure the high quality of labels. Then, an active learning-based model training strategy is adopted to enable the model to have both the abilities of generalization and discrimination on different defect features. Besides, an innovative informativeness assessment method is proposed by flexibly combining the degree of uncertainty and the degree of representativeness. Through the proposed method, the performance of facade defects detection can be further boosted with the same amount but more informative training data so that the cost-efficiency of human annotation work can be improved.\",\"Weathering, aging, infiltration, solar radiation and several other factors cause the deterioration of buildings and infrastructures and hence the need for periodical maintenance and restoration. The need for maintenance has been traditionally determined based on visual inspections of qualified operators. Since this process is obviously time consuming and quite expensive, especially when the considered building is quite large and high, then a number of recent studies have been recently published proposing remote sensing tools in order to ease the monitoring process. Among the possible spatial data acquisition sensors, terrestrial laser scanning has been considered in several of the existing studies, mostly because of its high reliability, to cope with cracks and defect detection up to the millimeter level of resolution, which is the typical accuracy of the current generation of professional laser scanners. This paper considers the problem of detecting small defects on the facade of a University building Similar to other previous studies, in this work defect detection is accomplished by considering distances with respect to a planar surface locally fitted on the building facade. Then, statistical filtering and machine learning tools have been implemented in order to cope with damage detection of the brick surfaces at sub-millimeter level.\",\"We propose a cost-effective, non-intrusive approach to assess the quality of the thermal isolation of the building stock in a given municipality or small city. Our prototype measurement system, mounted on a vehicle, acquires geotagged optical and infrared images from the street-side of the buildings. A basic approach to detect gross thermal anomalies, such as thermal bridges, via a binary classifier trained on 2000 carefully labeled infrared images is demonstrated. Thermal anomalies are identified with a precision score of around 89.2 % and 75.6 % recall on a test dataset of 1184 images infrared recorded in Hergiswil (NW). The enabled automated assessment helps to identify retrofitting targets and supports increasing the renovation rate.\",\"Crack damage evaluation is a crucial index in building repair and maintenance for assessing the health of buildings. This study propose a framework for crack segmentation and damage evaluation to provide a rapid and accurate crack evaluation in practical applications. The framework consists of four steps: data set collection, training of the crack segmentation model, indicator establishment, and damage severity evaluation. Deeplabv3 + is used for crack segmentation. And different indicators are established based on connected domain analysis. To determine the severity of the crack, we establish a damage factor through hierarchical analysis. Field experiments are carried out on real buildings to assess crack damage and verify the method's feasibility and effectiveness. Our proposed method provides a fast and reliable way to evaluate cracks in buildings, which has a high potential for practical application.\",\"In recent years, as number of new building getting larger, there has been an increased interest in the cleaning of exterior walls. Accordingly, there is a growing interest in automatic cleaning robots that move around the outer building facade. These robots are also required to apply different cleaning methods to remove various contaminants on the outer wall of the building. However, current surface contaminant detection systems can either detect only a single type of contaminant, or are not compact enough for installation on mobile platforms that move around the outer facade. As cleaning workers are able to distinguish various contaminants with the naked eye, we aim to solve this problem by developing a machine-vision system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image processing methods. As it is a compact system that uses only a camera to take pictures and a processor to process the images, it is suitable for applications involving mobile platforms. Object-type contaminants such as avian feces are handled by the YOLOv3 module using the object-detection algorithm. Area-type contaminants such as rusty stains are processed using the color-detection module using the HSV color space, median filter, and flood fill algorithm. Particle-type contaminants such as dust are handled by the grayscale module, converting images to grayscale images and then comparing the average brightness with a reference that is provided in advance. This proposed machine vision system will detect objects, areas, and particle-type contaminants with a single image and some reference images provided in advance.\",\"Timely assessment of damages induced to buildings due to an earthquake is critical for ensuring life safety, mitigating financial losses, and expediting the rehabilitation process as well as enhancing the structural resilience where resilience is measured by an infrastructure's capacity to restore full functionality post extreme events. Since manual inspection is expensive, time consuming and risky, low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles or robots can be leveraged as a viable alternative for quick reconnaissance. Visual data captured by the sensors mounted on the robots can be analyzed, and the damages can be detected and classified autonomously. The present study proposes the use of deep learning-based approaches to this end. Region-based convolutional neural network (Faster RCNN) is exploited to detect four different damage types, namely, surface crack, spalling (which includes facade spalling and concrete spalling), and severe damage with exposed rebars and severely buckled rebars. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on manually annotated image data collected from reinforced concrete buildings damaged under several past earthquakes such as Nepal (2015), Taiwan (2016), Ecuador (2016), Erzincan (1992), Duzce (1999), Bingol (2003), Peru (2007), Wenchuan (2008), and Haiti (2010). Several experiments are presented in the paper to illustrate the capabilities, as well as the limitations, of the proposed approach for earthquake reconnaissance. It was observed that Inception-ResNet-v2 significantly outperforms the other networks considered in this study. The research outcome is a stepping stone forward to facilitate the autonomous assessment of buildings where this can be potentially useful for insurance companies, government agencies, and property owners.\",\"In the last decade, the documentation of historical buildings has made tremendous progress in generalising the use of high-precision laser scanning and drone photogrammetry. Yet the potential of digital surveying is not fully exploited due to difficulties in manually analysing large amounts of collected data. Machine learning offers immense potential as a game-changer in building archaeology, especially for the documentation of structures composed of millions of units. This paper presents the first segmentation of large-scale surveys of historic masonry using machine learning, using the thirteenth-century Basilica of St Anthony (Padua, Italy) as a case study. Based on a drone survey of the north facade of the building (110 x 70 m), a state-of-the-art non-learning segmentation approach is described and its limitations for historical structures are illustrated. Then, a new workflow based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) is presented. The result is a precise mapping of about 300,000 individual bricks showing a large variety of formats and bonds. The automatic surveys are analysed using visual programming language (VPL), enabling a rapid and feature-based identification of building phases and repair interventions. The outcome demonstrates the validity of machine learning for the analysis of historical structures and its potential in the field of heritage.\",\"This paper proposes an automated approach to predict crack pattern similarities that correlate well with assessment by structural engineers. We use Siamese convolutional neural networks (SCNN) that take two crack pattern images as inputs and output scalar similarity measures. We focus on 2D masonry facades with and without openings. The image pairs are generated using a statistics-based approach and labelled by 28 structural engineering experts. When the data is randomly split into fit and test data, the SCNNs can achieve good performance on the test data (R-2 approximate to 0.9). When the SCNNs are tested on unseen archetypes, their test R-2 values are on average 1% lower than the case where all archetypes are seen during the training. These very good results indicate that SCNNs can generalise to unseen cases without compromising their performance. Although the analyses are restricted to the considered synthetic images, the results are promising and the approach is general.\",\"This paper describes a knowledge-based system for the non-destructive diagnostics of facade isolation. The system uses the fusion of information extracted from images obtained from two electromagnetic wavebands: from low-resolution IR images (320 x 240 pixels: 7.5-13 mu m wavelength), and from high-resolution visual RGB images (3264 x 2448 pixels; 0.39-0.75 mu m wavelength). The fusion of the information is a perquisite for the design of an efficient knowledge-based system for non-destructive testing and facade diagnostics. In the paper, special attention is devoted to the following knowledge-based system components: system-core components (the database, the knowledge base, the inference engine, and the user interface) and application-specific components (image acquisition, the resolution pyramid, image pre-processing and feature extraction, image registration, object segmentation, fusion, and data analysis). Examples of the non-destructive testing and the facade diagnostics obtained with the system are presented. \",\"Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are frequently used for periodic visual inspection of building envelopes to detect unsafe conditions or vulnerable damages. Inspection practitioners have to manually examine the large amounts of high-resolution images collected by UAVs to identify anomalies or damages on building facades for reporting and repairs. The computer vision and deep learning technologies have emerged as promising solutions to automate the image-based inspection process. However, for the detection of facade cracks from UAV-captured images, existing deep learning solutions may not perform well due to the complicated background noises caused by different facade components and materials. Towards that end, this paper proposed a two-step deep learning method for the automated detection of facade cracks from UAV-captured images. In the first step, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model was designed and trained on 26,177 images to classify images in a patch-level size of 128 x 128 pixels into crack or non-crack. In the second step, a U-Net neural network model was trained on 2870 image sets to segment crack pixels within those patches classified as cracks. Experimental results show a high performance of 94% and 96% precision, 94% and 95% recall, and 94% and 96% F1-scores was achieved by the CNN model and the U-Net model respectively. The experimental results proved that the twostep method can improve the reliability and efficiency of detecting and differentiating facade cracks from complicated facade noises. The proposed method can also be extended to detect other types of facade anomalies (e.g., corrosion and joint failures), thus facilitating a comprehensive assessment of facade conditions for better decision-making for the maintenance of building facades during its service life.\",\"As the number of high-rise buildings is increasing, more methods of exterior-wall cleaning are being developed. There are a few models based on artificial intelligence that determine the type and level of contamination primarily by moving the cleaning area. In this study, we propose an system using YOLOv3 algorithm, color-detection, to install on facade cleaning robot and brightness-discrimination. There are three types of contaminant-detection parameters: size, color, and brightness, and these parameters are subjected to a robust optimization process to maintain a constant detection rate under different conditions. The three parameters are determined via Taguchi method with signal to noise ratio and noise factors. An environment for algorithm testing is established, and artificial contamination is implemented on the specimen. A field test with the detection algorithm shall be performed in the near
