Experiments were performed on a facade during a damage assessment to analyze key, visually-based features that are important for understanding human-infrastructure interaction during the process. For data collection and analysis, experiments were conducted to assess an inspector's behavioral changes while assessing a real structure. These eye tracking features provided the basis for the inspector's intent prediction and were used to understand how humans interact with the structure during the inspection processes.

However, traditional approaches to understand styles and their evolution require domain expertise, fieldwork and extensive manual processes. Recent research in deep learning and computer vision has highlighted the great potential in analyzing urban environments from images. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework for understanding architectural styles and age epochs by deciphering building facades based on street-level imagery. The frame-work is composed of two stages: Deep 'Learning' the architecture and Deep 'Interpreting' the architecture age epochs and styles. In Deep 'Learning', a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model is designed to automatically learn about the age characteristics of building facades from street view images. In Deep 'Inter-preting' stage, three components are proposed to understand the different perspectives regarding building ages and styles. In the experiment, a building age epoch dataset is compiled for the city of Amsterdam and Stockholm to understand the evolution of architectural element styles and the relationship between building ages and styles spatially and temporally. This research illustrates how publicly available data and deep learning could be used to trace the evolution of architectural styles in the spatial-temporal domain.","[Sun, Maoran; Zhang, Fan; Duarte, Fabio; Ratti, Carlo] MIT, Senseable City Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Zhang, F (corresponding author), MIT, Senseable City Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",zhangfan@link.cuhk.edu.hk,,,,,,,,26,27,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2022,128,,,,,,,,103787,10.1016/j.cities.2022.103787,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2022.103787,,Jun.22,,Urban Studies,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000812045100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although the artificial intelligence technology has made a breakthrough in image segmentation, it is nontrivial to directly apply standard deep learning approaches for building facade element detection. The main reason is that the existing semantic segmentation networks have a bad performance in predicting highly regularized shapes. This research develops a hieratical deep learning framework with a symmetric loss function to automatically detect building facade elements from images. The new framework contains two types of attention modules, namely, the spatial attention module, and the channel attention module. A new loss function is designed to integrate prior engineering knowledge, which can be used to force the detection of facade elements (e.g., windows, doors, concrete walls, and sunshades) to have a highly proportionate shape. The effectiveness of the developed approach is demonstrated in two public datasets. Experimental results indicate that the developed deep learning framework with a new loss function outperforms state-of-the-art models significantly, where the achieved a Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) on the Ecole Centrale Paris(ECP) dataset (81.9%) brings an improvement of 11.3% over Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and 4.0% over Deepfacade, respectively, and the achieved a Mean IoU on the ArtDeco dataset (85.6%) yields an improvement of 11.4% over FCN and 5.8% over Deepfacade, respectively. Moreover, the developed approach is more practical and effective to detect regularized facade elements, where the detection of the wall components has an IoU of 93.6% on the ECP dataset and 88.6% on the ArtDeco dataset, respectively. Overall, the contribution from the technical aspect is to develop a hieratical deep learning framework consisting of attention modules together with the newly designed loss function and the prior engineering knowledge. The contribution from the practical aspect is to realize the automatic and accurate detection for various building facade elements in complex environments, which can be potentially helpful for the infrastructure monitoring and maintenance operation.","[Zhang, Gaowei; Pan, Yue; Zhang, Limao] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Pan, Yue] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Shanghai Key Lab Digital Maintenance Bldg & Infra, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Zhang, LM (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",gwzhang@ntu.edu.sg; panyue001@sjtu.edu.cn; limao.zhang@ntu.edu.sg,,,,,,,,24,26,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2022,133,,,,,,,,104016,10.1016/j.autcon.2021.104016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2021.104016,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000787885200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Inspection practitioners have to manually examine the large amounts of high-resolution images collected by UAVs to identify anomalies or damages on building facades for reporting and repairs. The computer vision and deep learning technologies have emerged as promising solutions to automate the image-based inspection process. However, for the detection of facade cracks from UAV-captured images, existing deep learning solutions may not perform well due to the complicated background noises caused by different facade components and materials. Towards that end, this paper proposed a two-step deep learning method for the automated detection of facade cracks from UAV-captured images. In the first step, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model was designed and trained on 26,177 images to classify images in a patch-level size of 128 x 128 pixels into crack or non-crack. In the second step, a U-Net neural network model was trained on 2870 image sets to segment crack pixels within those patches classified as cracks. Experimental results show a high performance of 94% and 96% precision, 94% and 95% recall, and 94% and 96% F1-scores was achieved by the CNN model and the U-Net model respectively. The experimental results proved that the twostep method can improve the reliability and efficiency of detecting and differentiating facade cracks from complicated facade noises. The proposed method can also be extended to detect other types of facade anomalies (e.g., corrosion and joint failures), thus facilitating a comprehensive assessment of facade conditions for better decision-making for the maintenance of building facades during its service life.","[Chen, Kaiwen] Univ Alabama, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 401 7th Ave, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Reichard, Georg; Akanmu, Abiola] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Bldg Construct, 1365 Perry St, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Xu, Xin] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Chen, KW (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 401 7th Ave, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",kaiwen.chen@ua.edu; reichard@vt.edu; xu942@purdue.edu; abiola@vt.edu,,,,,,,,37,37,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021,43,,,,,,,,102913,10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102913,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102913,,Jul.21,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000701626700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although it is 'performance-based', the final selection of a real design project still needs to consider the aesthetics of design choices. However, due to the overwhelming number of design choices generated by PGAD, it is difficult for designers to choose the most favourable one from them. Therefore, the current study tries to integrate the technology of sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) into the selecting stage of PGAD. Rather than navigating alternatives one from another and getting lost, designers can directly find the most aesthetically preferred one by inputting his/her hand-drawn design. A design project of fenestrating a multiple-floor office building is used to demonstrate this method and test three SBIR algorithms: Angular radial partitioning (ARP), Angular radial orientation partitioning (AROP), and Sketch-A-Net model (SAN). Test results show that AROP performs the best among these three algorithms. Its retrievals are most similar to inquiry images drawn by architects.

Regular inspection is required for proper maintenance and automatic inspection offers a significant advantage over manual inspection as it is efficient and accurate. Many previous studies are focus on detecting damages in factory tiles for the quality control purposes, although there has not been much study on tile damages for historical temples. This paper proposed an image-based system to detect damages in tiles using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on a temple facade. The dataset was created by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and a digital camera from a historical temple in Bangkok, Thailand. In the proposed work, CNN was trained on various image patches sizes. The detection accuracy of the system was found to be 95% in the validation data and 91% on the testing data. The results of the proposed system were compared with a system using hand-crafted features, including 2D wavelet transforms with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

In this article, we propose a deep learning approach for crack detection on brickwork masonry facades using transfer learning with limited annotated data. Our approach uses a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network model as a feature extractor, which is then optimised specifically for crack detection. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we created and curated a dataset of 700 brickwork masonry facade images, and used 500 images for training, 100 for validation, and the remaining 100 images for testing. Results showed that our approach is very effective in detecting cracks, achieving an accuracy and F1-score of up to 100% when following end-to-end training of the neural network, thus being a promising solution for building inspection and maintenance, particularly in situations where annotated data is limited.

The existing grammar-based approaches for facade parsing rely on strong prior knowledge but can obtain facade parts with better structure. Pixelwise-segmentation-based approaches achieve facade parsing with much less knowledge but the resulting structure of facade parts is normally incomplete. Both these approaches are restricted by their high reliance on the data set. Therefore, they cannot be applied for facade parsing with complex scenes. To address this issue, we built a large street-level data set by taking Mapillary images as the training data for more general scenes. At the same time, we propose a new pipeline based on convolutional neural network (CNN) that combines pixelwise segmentation and global object detection to achieve better results for facade parsing. Our pipeline can be applied to facade images after rectification and street-level facade images with complex scenes. The result of the ablation study demonstrates that the design of our pipeline is effective. We test our pipeline on the classic ECP2011 data set and our new large street-level data set.

To automatically achieve visual evaluation of facade condition with high accuracy, current studies have applied various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to classify, localize, and segment the defects. However, the methods in previous research mainly focused on accuracy improvement rather than providing effective evaluations of defects according to the requirement of industry standards. Therefore, this study proposes a rule-based deep learning method to achieve evaluation-oriented facade defects detection, which can be used to provide effective evaluation areas containing the necessary information (e.g., type, location, quantity, and size of facade defects) for condition evaluation. First, annotation rules for classification, segmentation, and localization are designed to instruct the manual annotation work and automatically adjust the bounding boxes into effective evaluation areas. Then, a proposal weighting rule is developed to be combined with the deep learning model during the model training process to improve the accuracy and stability of the predictions. A rectification rule is further used to adjust the raw predictions into predictions with effective evaluation areas for facade defects. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrated that using the proposed method can successfully improve the performance of facade defects detection to meet the requirement of condition evaluation.

Deep learning is a promising approach to facade parsing, however, a straightforward solution by directly applying standard deep learning approaches cannot always yield the optimal results. This is primarily due to two reasons: 1) it is nontrivial to train existing semantic segmentation networks for facade parsing, e.g., Fully-Convolutional Neural Networks (FCN) which are usually weak at predicting fine-grained shapes (J. Long et al., 2015); and 2) building facades are man-made architectures with highly regularized shape priors, and the prior knowledge plays an important role in facade parsing, for which how to integrate the prior knowledge into deep neural networks remains an open problem. In this paper, we present a novel symmetric loss function that can be used in deep neural networks for end-to-end training. This novel loss is based on the assumption that most of windows and doors have a highly symmetric rectangle shape, and it penalizes all window predictions that are non-rectangles. This prior knowledge is smoothly integrated into the end-to-end training process. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our method has outperformed previous state-of-art methods significantly on five popular facade parsing datasets. Qualitative results have shown that our method effectively aids deep convolutional neural networks to predict more accurate, visually pleasing, and symmetric shapes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate symmetry constraint into end-to-end training in deep neural networks for facade parsing.","[Liu, Hantang; Xu, Yinghao; Zhang, Jialiang; Zhu, Jianke; Li, Yang] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jianke] Alibaba Zhejiang Univ Joint Res Inst Frontier Tec, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Hoi, Steven C.

Accordingly, there is a growing interest in automatic cleaning robots that move around the outer building facade. These robots are also required to apply different cleaning methods to remove various contaminants on the outer wall of the building. However, current surface contaminant detection systems can either detect only a single type of contaminant, or are not compact enough for installation on mobile platforms that move around the outer facade. As cleaning workers are able to distinguish various contaminants with the naked eye, we aim to solve this problem by developing a machine-vision system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image processing methods. As it is a compact system that uses only a camera to take pictures and a processor to process the images, it is suitable for applications involving mobile platforms. Object-type contaminants such as avian feces are handled by the YOLOv3 module using the object-detection algorithm. Area-type contaminants such as rusty stains are processed using the color-detection module using the HSV color space, median filter, and flood fill algorithm. Particle-type contaminants such as dust are handled by the grayscale module, converting images to grayscale images and then comparing the average brightness with a reference that is provided in advance. This proposed machine vision system will detect objects, areas, and particle-type contaminants with a single image and some reference images provided in advance.","[Lee, Jiseok; Park, Garam; Seo, TaeWon] Hanyang Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea; [Hong, Jooyoung] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Kim, Hwa Soo] Kyounggi Univ, Sch Mech Syst Engn, Suwon 16227, South Korea; [Lee, Sungon] Hanyang Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Ansan 15588, South Korea",Hanyang University; Seoul National University (SNU); Hanyang University,"Seo, T (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea.;Lee, S (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Ansan 15588, South Korea.",sungon@hanyang.ac.kr; taewonseo@hanyang.ac.kr,,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,8,,,,,,180010,180021,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3027839,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3027839,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000578630800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Defects in a building facade are typically managed using manpower during maintenance. This approach is time-consuming, yields subjective results, and can lead to accidents or casualties. To address this, we propose a building facade monitoring system that utilizes an object detection method based on deep learning to efficiently manage defects by minimizing the involvement of manpower. The dataset used for training a deep-learning-based network contains actual residential building facade images. Various building designs in these raw images make it difficult to detect defects because of their various types and complex backgrounds. We employed the faster regions with convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) structure for more accurate defect detection in such environments, achieving an average precision (intersection over union (IoU) = 0.5) of 62.7% for all types of trained defects. As it is difficult to detect defects in a training environment, it is necessary to improve the performance of the network. However, the object detection network employed in this study yields an excellent performance in complex real-world images, indicating the possibility of developing a system that would detect defects in more types of building facades.","[Lee, Kisu; Kim, Ha Young] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Informat, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea; [Hong, Goopyo] Kangwon Natl Univ, Div Architecture & Civil Engn, 346 Jungang Ro, Samcheok Si 25913, Gangwon Do, South Korea; [Sael, Lee] Ajou Univ, Dept Data Sci, 206 World Cup Ro, Suwon 16499, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Lee, Sanghyo] Hanyang Univ, ERICA, Div Smart Convergence Engn, 55 Hanyangdaehak Ro, Ansan 15588, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Yonsei University; Kangwon National University; Ajou University; Hanyang University,"Kim, H (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Informat, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.;Lee, S (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, ERICA, Div Smart Convergence Engn, 55 Hanyangdaehak Ro, Ansan 15588, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",kisu0928@naver.com; goopyoh@kangwon.ac.kr; sael@ajou.ac.kr; mir0903@hanyang.ac.kr; hayoung.kim@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,,12,12,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2020,12,22,,,,,,,9785,10.3390/su12229785,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12229785,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000595048500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Moreover, most of the existing literature has utilized the Pix2Pix algorithm for facade generation experiments, failing to attempt to replace the original generator in Pix2Pix with a different generator for experiments. This study addresses the above issues by collecting and filtering entries from the international Solar Decathlon (SD competition) to obtain a data set. Subsequently, a low-rise residential building facade generation model based on the Pix2Pix neural network was constructed for training and testing. At the same time, the original U-net generator in Pix2Pix was replaced with three different generators, U-net++, HRNet and AttU-net, for training and test results were obtained.

However, the previous object removal typically requires a user to manually create a mask around unwanted objects and obtain background facade information in advance, which would be labor-intensive when implementing multitasking projects. Moreover, accurately detecting objects to be removed in the cityscape and inpainting the static obstructed building facade to obtain plausible images are the main challenges for this objective. To overcome these difficulties, this study addresses the object removal with the facade inpainting problem from the following two aspects. First, we proposed an image-based cityscape elimination method for automatic object removal and facade inpainting by applying semantic segmentation to detect several classes, including pedestrians, riders, vegetation, and cars, as well as using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for filling detected regions by background textures and patching information from street-level imagery. Second, we proposed a workflow to filter unoccluded building facades from street view images automatically and tailored a dataset for the GAN-based image inpainting model with original and mask images. Furthermore, several full-reference image quality assessment (IQA) metrics are introduced to evaluate the generated image quality. Validation results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed method, and the synthetic image is visually realistic and semantically consistent.","[Zhang, Jiaxin; Fukuda, Tomohiro; Yabuki, Nobuyoshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Div Sustainable Energy & Environm Engn, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan",Osaka University,"Fukuda, T (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Div Sustainable Energy & Environm Engn, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",fukuda@see.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,9,,,,,,117486,117495,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3106124,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3106124,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000690431800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper proposes an efficient approach for evaluating HBFC on a large-scale using SVIs and a deep learning algorithm. Specifically, a shadow processing method was developed, and transfer learning was integrated into the harmoniousness evaluation process. The historical district of Guangzhou, China, was selected as a case study area. This study contributes to the development of human-centered planning and design by providing continuous measurements of unmeasurable quality across large-scale areas.

The current inspection procedure is labor-intensive and time-consuming and poses significant safety issues like falling from height. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with computer vision techniques represent a promising approach for visual crack inspection on high-rise building facades. One research challenge to achieving automated visual crack inspection is image degradation in the form of motion blur caused by UAVs during image acquisition. Motion blur arises due to excessive vibrations of the UAV platform, and this may adversely affect crack detection. In this paper, a deep learning-based deblurring model based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed to address this challenge. Further, by recognizing a strong correlation between blurred and sharpened crack images, the idea of using a localized skip connection is introduced. Experimental validation of the proposed deblurring model is carried out by investigating the impact of skip connections on deblurring. The proposed model is also compared against the state-of-the-art deblurring model, and results indicate that the proposed model is able to achieve significant improvements in deblurring performance in terms of both global structure and feature details in crack images.","[Liu, Yiqing; Yeoh, Justin K.

Secondly, the coordinate attention module was added to the model to enhance feature extraction capability. Next, the SCYLLA-IoU was used to expedite the rate of convergence and increase the recall of the model. Finally, we have extended the open datasets to construct a building facade damage dataset that includes three typical defects. BFD-YOLO demonstrates excellent accuracy and efficiency based on this dataset.

Computer vision-based techniques provide opportunities to autonomously detect such heat anomalies to significantly improve the efficiency of decision-making for building envelope retrofitting and maintenance. In this work, we propose a novel Capsule Network-based deep learning model - CapsLab - that detects and identifies thermal anomalies by semantic segmentation. CapsLab is built based on our proposed prediction-tuning capsule (PT-Capsule) layer. Different from a traditional capsule layer, which consists of part-whole transformation and capsule-routing process, the proposed layer is composed of a prediction and tuning process, which helps decreasing the number of model parameters significantly. While the applicability of traditional Capsule Networks (CapsNets) has been limited to simpler tasks and smaller datasets due to their scalability issue, we can leverage the lightweight of the proposed PT-Capsule layer, and apply it to the semantic segmentation task. In this work, we also employ our previously presented performance metric, referred to as the Anomaly Identification Metric (AIM) (Kakillioglua et al. 2021), to evaluate the segmentation outputs. Traditional performance metrics do not accurately reflect the true performance of the segmentation models in thermal anomaly identification due to the high subjectivity in the annotation process and higher overlap ratio sensitivity of the standard metrics. AIM, on the other hand, is robust to these drawbacks. Experimental results show, both qualitatively and quantitatively, that our proposed segmentation method can effectively segment the thermal anomalies. Specifically, our model provides 9.38% and 13.53% improvements over the baseline model - DeepLabV3+ - based on traditional mIoU score and the AIM score, respectively, while requiring less model parameters and less computation at the same time. In addition, the scores that the AIM metric generates better align with the scores provided by building performance experts.","[Pan, Chenbin; Wang, Jiyang; Chai, Weiheng; Velipasalar, Senem] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY USA; [Kakillioglu, Burak] Motorola Solut Inc, Chicago, MA 60661 USA; [El Masri, Yasser; Panagoulia, Eleanna; Rakha, Tarek] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA USA; [Bayomi, Norhan; Fernandez, John E.] MIT, Cambridge, MA USA; [Chen, Kaiwen] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL USA",Syracuse University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Kakillioglu, B (corresponding author), Motorola Solut Inc, Chicago, MA 60661 USA.",bkakilli@syr.edu,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2022,54,,,,,,,,101767,10.1016/j.aei.2022.101767,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2022.101767,,Oct.22,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Multidisciplinary",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000877545400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Detecting windows, crucial to 3D semantic reconstruction and scene parsing, is a challenging task in computer vision. Early methods try to solve window detection by using hand-crafted features and traditional classifiers. However, these methods are unable to handle the diversity of window instances in real scenes and suffer from heavy computational costs. Recently, convolutional neural networks based object detection algorithms attract much attention due to their good performances. Unfortunately, directly training them for challenging window detection cannot achieve satisfying results. In this paper, we propose an approach for window detection. It involves an improved Faster R-CNN architecture for window detection, featuring in a window region proposal network, an RoI feature fusion and a context enhancement module. Besides, a post optimization process is designed by the regular distribution of windows to refine detection results obtained by the improved deep architecture. Furthermore, we present a newly collected dataset which is the largest one for window detection in real street scenes to date. Experimental results on both existing datasets and the new dataset show that the proposed method has outstanding performance.","[Ma, Wenguang; Ma, Wei] Beijing Univ Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Technology,"Ma, W (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.",mawenguang@emails.bjut.edu.cn; mawei@bjut.edu.cn,,,,,,,,6,7,,,,,,,,,,,Feb.29,2020,14,2,,,,,855,870,,10.3837/tiis.2020.02.022,http://dx.doi.org/10.3837/tiis.2020.02.022,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000518453900022,View Full Record in Web of Science

With the recent development and use of city digital twins (CDTs), massive high-quality digital assets of buildings have been created. These assets make it possible to generate high-quality and cost-effective synthetic datasets that can replace real-world ones as training sets for the supervised learning-based instance segmentation of building facades. In this study, we developed a novel framework that can automatically produce synthetic datasets from a CDT. An auto-generation system for synthetic street views was built by rendering city digital assets in a game engine, while the system auto-generated the instance annotations for building facades. The hybrid dataset HSRBFIA, along with various subsets containing different proportions of synthetic and real data, were used to train deep learning models for facade instance segmentation. In our experiments, two types of synthetic data (CDT-based and virtual-based) were compared, and the results showed that the CDT synthetic data were more effective in boosting deep learning training with real-world images compared with the virtual synthetic data (no real-world counterparts).

The proposed approach can provide city managers with an overall perception of urban facade color and building function across city-scale areas in a cost-efficient way, contributing to data-driven decision making for urban analytics and planning.","[Zhang, Jiaxin; Fukuda, Tomohiro; Yabuki, Nobuyoshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Div Sustainable Energy & Environm Engn, 2-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan",Osaka University,"Fukuda, T (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Div Sustainable Energy & Environm Engn, 2-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",zhang@it.see.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp; fukuda@see.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp; yabuki@see.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,,22,22,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2021,10,8,,,,,,,551,10.3390/ijgi10080551,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10080551,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000689226000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the images for building segmentation are often in the form of traditional orthophotos, where the relief displacement would cause non-negligible misalignment between the roof outline and the footprint of a building; such misalignment poses considerable challenges for extracting accurate building footprints, especially for high-rise buildings. Aiming at alleviating this problem, a new workflow is proposed for generating rectified building footprints from traditional orthophotos. We first use the facade labels, which are prepared efficiently at low cost, along with the roof labels to train a semantic segmentation network. Then, the well-trained network, which employs the state-of-the-art version of EfficientNet as backbone, extracts the roof segments and the facade segments of buildings from the input image. Finally, after clustering the classified pixels into instance-level building objects and tracing out the roof outlines, an energy function is proposed to drive the roof outline to maximally align with the building footprint; thus, the rectified footprints can be generated. The experiments on the aerial orthophotos covering a high-density residential area in Shanghai demonstrate that the proposed workflow can generate obviously more accurate building footprints than the baseline methods, especially for high-rise buildings.","[Chen, Qi; Zhang, Yuanyi; Li, Xinyuan] China Univ Geosci Wuhan, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Tao, Pengjie] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences; Wuhan University,"Chen, Q (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci Wuhan, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",chenqi@cug.edu.cn; zhangyy@cug.edu.cn; li.xinyuan@cug.edu.cn; pjtao@whu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2022,22,1,,,,,,,207,10.3390/s22010207,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22010207,,,,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000741383000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This research employs a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to develop a generative technique for designing building facades in villages and cities. The provided results can be used to develop schemes and as design references for building facade design, enhancing the design efficiency of building facades. Simultaneously, we utilized this model for the rehabilitation of building facades in villages and towns, as well as in the visual design of rural tourism products, demonstrating its practical usefulness and design-related potential. We took villages and towns in the Wuyishan area of China as an example and carried out model training, image generation, and a comparison of the derivation results of different assumed buildings and product contours. The research shows that: (1) CGAN can be used to produce and supply reference schemes for conventional civil construction facade design in rural and urban areas. (2) In terms of adaptability, CGAN may develop architectural facade design schemes with a reference value for the hypothetical experimental building facades, and it can play a role in other design domains, as well.

A rephotographed image is the best presentation to visualize and study the social changes of a location over time. Traditionally, only expert artists and photographers are capable of generating the rephotograph of any specific location. Manual editing or human eye judgment that is considered for generating rephotographs normally requires a lot of precision, effort and is not always accurate. In the era of computer science and deep learning, computer vision techniques make it easier and faster to perform precise operations to an image. Until now many research methodologies have been proposed for rephotography but none of them is fully automatic. Some of these techniques require manual input by the user or need multiple images of the same location with 3D point cloud data while others are only suggestions to the user to perform rephotography. In historical records/archives most of the time we can find only one 2D image of a certain location. Computational rephotography is a challenge in the case of using only one image of a location captured at different timestamps because it is difficult to find the accurate perspective of a single 2D historical image. Moreover, in the case of building rephotography, it is required to maintain the alignments and regular shape. The features of a building may change over time and in most of the cases, it is not possible to use a features detection algorithm to detect the key features. In this research paper, we propose a methodology to rephotograph house images by combining deep learning and traditional computer vision techniques. The purpose of this research is to rephotograph an image of the past based on a single image. This research will be helpful not only for computer scientists but also for history and cultural heritage research scholars to study the social changes of a location during a specific time period, and it will allow users to go back in time to see how a specific place looked in the past.

In particular, individual-level AH detection provides essential information for fine-resolution urban studies, government decision-makers, and private sector practitioners. However, three primary conventional data sources (field data, utility data, and remote sensing data) cannot suffice to collect such fine-resolution data in the large spatial area via a cost-effective approach. To this end, Google Street View (GSV) imagery, which emerges as the mainstream open-access data source with global coverage, provides an opportunity to address this issue. Subsequently, a follow-up challenge confronting the detection of AH arises from the fact that it lacks an effective method that can discern authentic visual features from the redundant noise in GSV images. In this study, we aim to develop an effective method to detect individual-level AH from GSV imagery. Specifically, we developed a new hierarchical deep learning method to leverage both global and local visual features of AH in the detection. The method can be further divided into three steps: (1) Scene-based classification that can extract global visual features of AH was implemented through fine-tuning a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model. (2) We developed a patch-based classification method that can extract specific local features of AH. In this method, patches were generated from GSV images based on auto-detected local features, followed by being labeled as three categories: building patches, vegetation patches, and others. Two deep CNN models were employed to identify deteriorated building facade patches and overgrown vegetation patches, respectively. (3) Individual-level AH were detected by integrating scene classification results and patch classification results in a decision-tree model. Experimental results showed that the F-score of AH was 0.84 in a well-prepared dataset collected from five different Rust Belt cities. The proposed hierarchical deep learning approach effectively improved the accuracy comparing with the traditional scene-based method. In addition, the proposed method was applied to generate an AH map in a new site in Detroit, MI. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of GSV imagery in AH detection and showed great potential to detect AH in a large spatial extent.","[Zou, Shengyuan; Wang, Le] Univ Buffalo State Univ New York, Dept Geog, Amherst, NY 14261 USA",,"Wang, L (corresponding author), Univ Buffalo State Univ New York, Dept Geog, Amherst, NY 14261 USA.",szou2@buffalo.edu; lewang@buffalo.edu,,,,,,,,13,15,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2021,175,,,,,,298,310,,10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2021.03.020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2021.03.020,,Apr.21,,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000644695700021,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, complying with these policies is expensive and time-consuming for government agencies and building owners, especially for old buildings where detailed building information is not readily available. In this work, we propose an automatic, non-intrusive, and scalable framework to capture energy-essential building variables through reasoning building facade images -FacadeReasoner.

Next, we propose a method to automatically collect an urban scale building image dataset with more than 10,000 facade images and extract principal-building-variables from these images using deep transfer learning. Results show that FacadeReasoner has the capability to predict principal building variables, namely building type (accuracy 0.77), year built (accuracy 0.62), building height (R2 0.80), and rough estimates of building area (R2 0.46) from facade images. This study is unique as it marks the first attempt to enable an automated end-to-end framework for urban scale principal-building-variables extraction, providing an efficient and economical alternative for large building portfolio owners and managers (e.g., municipalities) to comprehend urban scale energy-related building information for informed decision-making, directly contributing to Net-Zero 2050.","[Yu, Xinran; Ergan, Semiha] NYU, Dept Civil & Urban Engn, 6 Metrotech Ctr, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [Zou, Zhengbo] Univ British Columbia, Fac Appl Sci, Dept Civil Engn, 6250 Appl Sci Ln, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering; University of British Columbia,"Yu, XR (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Civil & Urban Engn, 6 Metrotech Ctr, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.",celiayu@nyu.edu; zhengbo@civil.ubc.ca; semiha@nyu.edu,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,Aug.15,2023,344,,,,,,,,121228,10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121228,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121228,,May.23,,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:001001414700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The recent emergence of the potentiality of deep learning and computer vision has provided an alternative to traditional empirical-based judgment, which is limited by its subjective bias and high traversal costs. To address these challenges, this study aims to build a workflow for a visual analysis of function and facade to extract the different contributions that facade elements provide to functional expression. The approach is demonstrated with an experiment on a section of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) where large-scale historical buildings images were categorized to identify functions using deep learning, together with activation and substance for visual calculations. First, the dataset aggregated with images of historic buildings along the CER was used to identify functional categories using SE-DenseNet merging channel attention. The results of the model visualized using t-SNE and Grad-CAM were then used to analyze the relationships of facade features across functional categories and differences in elemental feature representation across functional prototypes. The results show the following: (1) SE-Densenet can more efficiently identify building functions from the closely linked facade images of historic building groups, with the average accuracy reaching 85.84%. (2) Urban-rural differences exist not only in the count of spatial distributions among the CER's historic building groups, but also in a significant visual divergence between functions related to urban life and those involved in the military, industry, and railways. (3) Windows and walls occupy areas with more characteristics, but their decorative elements have a higher intensity of features. The findings could enhance the objective understanding and deeper characteristics of the historical building group system, contributing to integrated conservation and characteristic sustainability.","[Li, Peilun; Zhao, Zhiqing; Chen, Yuling; Xie, Jiayu] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China; [Li, Peilun; Zhao, Zhiqing; Chen, Yuling; Xie, Jiayu] Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Key Lab Cold Reg Urban & Rural Human Settlement En, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China; [Li, Peilun; Zhao, Zhiqing; Chen, Yuling; Xie, Jiayu] Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Natl Terr Spatial Planning & Ecol Restorat, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China; [Li, Peilun; Chen, Yuling] Natl Univ Singapore, Coll Design & Engn, Singapore 117575, Singapore; [Zhang, Bocheng] Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Suzhou 215009, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; National University of Singapore; Suzhou University of Science & Technology,"Zhao, ZQ (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China.;Zhao, ZQ (corresponding author), Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Key Lab Cold Reg Urban & Rural Human Settlement En, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China.;Zhao, ZQ (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Natl Terr Spatial Planning & Ecol Restorat, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China.;Zhang, BC (corresponding author), Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Suzhou 215009, Peoples R China.",peilunli@hit.edu.cn; zzq@hit.edu.cn; bocheng@mail.usts.edu.cn; yulingchen@hit.edu.cn; jiayu.xie@stu.hit.edu.cn,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2023,15,22,,,,,,,15857,10.3390/su152215857,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su152215857,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:001113761500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

One type of segmentation, of particular interest to computer vision, is that of urban segmentation. Although recent solutions have leveraged on deep neural networks, approaches usually do not consider regularities appearing in facade structures (e.g., windows are often in groups of similar alignment, size, or spacing patterns) as well as additional urban structures such as building footprints and roofs. Moreover, both satellite and street view images are often noisy and occluded, thus getting the complete structure segmentation from a partial observation is difficult. Our key observations are that facades and other urban structures exhibit regular structures, and additional views are often available. In this paper, we present a novel framework (RFCNet) that consists of three modules to achieve multiple goals. Specifically, we propose Regularization to improve the regularities given an initial segmentation, Fusion that fuses multiple views of the segmentation, and Completion that can infer the complete structure if necessary. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively for multiple facade datasets. Furthermore, by applying our framework to other urban structures (e.g., building footprints and roofs), we demonstrate our approach can be generalized to various pattern types.","[Zhang, Xiaowei; Aliaga, Daniel] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Zhang, XW (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN USA.",zhan2597@purdue.edu,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2022,220,,,,,,,,103435,10.1016/j.cviu.2022.103435,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cviu.2022.103435,,May.22,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000802026200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

But for many applications, such as urban population density mapping or urban utility planning, a classification map based on individual buildings is much more informative. However, such semantic classification still poses some fundamental challenges, for example, how to retrieve fine boundaries of individual buildings. In this paper, we proposed a general framework for classifying the functionality of individual buildings. The proposed method is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which classify facade structures from street view images, such as Google Street View, in addition to remote sensing images which usually only show roof structures. Geographic information was utilized to mask out individual buildings, and to associate the corresponding street view images. We created a benchmark dataset which was used for training and evaluating CNNs.

Convolutional neural networks have shown promising results in window extraction. Most existing methods segment a facade into semantic categories and subsequently employ regularization based on the structure of manmade architectures. These methods merely concern the optimization of individual windows, without considering the spatial areas or relationships of windows. This paper presents a novel windows instance segmentation method based on Mask R-CNN architecture. The method features a spatial attention region proposal network and a relation module-enhanced head network. First, an attention module is introduced in the region proposal network to generate a spatial attention map, then the attention map is multiplied with the objectness scores of the classification branch. Second, for the head network, relation modules are added to model the spatial relationships between proposals. Appearance and geometric features are combined for instance recognition. Furthermore, we constructed a new window instance segmentation dataset with 1200 annotated images. With our dataset, the average precisions of our method on detection and segmentation increased from 53.1% and 53.7% to 56.4% and 56.7% compared with Mask R-CNN.

The network is divided into two parts: generator and discriminator; the generator proposes a attention transfer network cross layer based on the U-NET architecture; after the input image is encoded, the attention transfer network cross layer is used to reconstruct the encoding feature map of each layer. The decoding is performed by fusing the skip connection with the corresponding potential feature in the multi-scale decoder, solving the information loss between the codec network layers. Moreover, each decoding layer of the multi-scale decoder is prompted to generate consistent content, and finally the repaired image is obtained. After the decoding is completed, the decoding feature map of each layer is converted into a multi-scale RGB image, and the reconstruction L1 loss is applied on each scale; by minimizing the adversarial loss, the discriminator can determine the authenticity of the repaired image; the perceptual loss and style loss are introduced to judge the output image, so as to restrict the generator to generate more realistic and reasonable content. A qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis is performed on the Celeba, Facade, and Places2 with the current mainstream image inpainting algorithms. The results show that the repair results in this paper are better than others in terms of mean L1 loss, PSNR, and SSIM, and more in line with human visual characteristics. The attention transfer network cross layer proposed in this paper can effectively reconstruct the more detailed coding feature map, and it can play an active guiding role in the coding process by using skip connection; the image inpainting network can generate content that is highly consistent with the structure and semantics of the real image when repairing large-area irregular defect areas, which is more in line with the human visual experience.","[Yingnan, Shi; Yao, Fan] Xizang Minzu Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Xian Yang, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Ningjun, Zhang] Zhengzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China",Xizang Minzu University,"Yao, F (corresponding author), Xizang Minzu Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Xian Yang, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",fanyao11241983@163.com,,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2021,242,,,,,,,,167101,10.1016/j.ijleo.2021.167101,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijleo.2021.167101,,Jun.21,,Optics,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000683394100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, DL models are black-box methods hard to debug, interpret, and certify. DL alone cannot provide explanations that can be validated by a non technical audience such as end-users or domain experts. In contrast, symbolic AI systems that convert concepts into rules or symbols - such as knowledge graphs - are easier to explain. However, they present lower generalization and scaling capabilities. A very important challenge is to fuse DL representations with expert knowledge. One way to address this challenge, as well as the performance-explainability trade-off is by leveraging the best of both streams without obviating domain expert knowledge. In this paper, we tackle such problem by considering the symbolic knowledge is expressed in form of a domain expert knowledge graph. We present the eXplainable Neural-symbolic learning (X-NeSyL) methodology, designed to learn both symbolic and deep representations, together with an explainability metric to assess the level of alignment of machine and human expert explanations. The ultimate objective is to fuse DL representations with expert domain knowledge during the learning process so it serves as a sound basis for explainability. In particular, X-NeSyL methodology involves the concrete use of two notions of explanation, both at inference and training time respectively: (1) EXPLANet: Expert-aligned eXplainable Part-based cLAssifier NETwork Architecture, a compositional convolutional neural network that makes use of symbolic representations, and (2) SHAP-Backprop, an explainable AI-informed training procedure that corrects and guides the DL process to align with such symbolic representations in form of knowledge graphs.

One of the main steps in evaluating potential human and economic losses in a seismic risk assessment, is the development of inventory databases for existing building stocks in terms of load-resisting structural systems and material characteristics (building typologies classification). The common approach for building stock model classification is to perform extensive fieldwork and walk-down surveys in representative areas of a city, and in some cases using random sample surveys of geounits. This procedure is time and cost consuming, and subject to personal interpretation: to mitigate these costs, we have introduced a machine learning methodology to automate this classification based on publicly available image databases. We here use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically identify the different building typologies in the city of Oslo, Norway, based on facade images taken from in-situ fieldwork and from Google Street View. We use transfer learning of state-of-the-art pretrained CNNs to predict the Model Building Typology. The present article attempts to categorize Oslo's building stock in five main building typologies: timber, unreinforced masonry, reinforced concrete, composite (steel-reinforced concrete) and steel. This method results in 89% accuracy score for timber buildings, though only 35% success score for steel-reinforced concrete buildings. We here classify and define for the first time a relevant set of five typologies for the Norwegian building typologies as observed in Oslo and applicable at national level.

In this paper, we address this question by applying a computer vision model to 27 million street view images across 80 counties in the United States. Then, we use the spatial distribution of notable urban features identified through the street view images, such as street furniture, sidewalks, building facades, and vegetation, to predict the socioeconomic profiles of their immediate neighborhood. Our results show that these urban features alone can account for up to 83% of the variance in people's travel behavior, 62% in poverty status, 64% in crime, and 68% in health behaviors. The results outperform models based on points of interest (POI), population, and other demographic data alone. Moreover, incorporating urban features captured from street view images can improve the explanatory power of these other methods by 5% to 25%.

To improve the accuracy of architectural style classification, we propose an architectural style classification method based on CNN and channel-spatial attention. Firstly, we add a preprocessing operation before CNN feature extraction to select main building candidate region in architectural image and then use CNN feature extractor for deep feature extraction. Secondly, channel-spatial attention module is introduced to generate an attention map, which can not only enhance the texture feature representation of architectural images but also focus on the spatial features of different architectural elements.

However, deep learning models commonly need abundant labeled data for training, and it could be impractical and expensive to collect sufficient labeled samples for all classes of defects. Sometimes, there are only a few samples in rare classes, which are not able to support the training process. In addition, common classifiers based on deep learning cannot easily extend their recognition classes and thus cannot classify unseen classes with only a few samples. Therefore, to overcome the problem of insufficient data and the extension constraint of the classifier, a few-shot classification method based on an extensible classifier and contrastive learning is proposed to recognize unseen classes with limited (1, 2 or 5) samples. The extensible classifier implemented by imprinting weights can easily extend the model to classify unseen classes with a few samples. Meanwhile, contrastive learning, which is a complementary task in training, is used to enrich the model's generalization and representation on unseen classes. Besides, a hard negative mining (HNM) method is introduced to address the imbalanced data in contrastive learning and further improve accuracies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the few-shot classification accuracy with only 1 sample from 35.8% to 63.5% on novel and unseen classes, and from 73.1% to 82.1% on all classes, while maintaining a high and comparable accuracy (89.6%) on base classes.","[Cui, Zhiyan; Lu, Na] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Syst Engn Inst, Sch Automat Sci & Engn, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Cui, Zhiyan] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Built Environm, Singapore 117566, Singapore; [Wang, Qian] Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct & Real Estate, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; National University of Singapore; Southeast University - China,"Lu, N (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Syst Engn Inst, Sch Automat Sci & Engn, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Wang, Q (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct & Real Estate, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China.",bdgwang@nus.edu.sg; lvna2009@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2022,141,,,,,,,,104381,10.1016/j.autcon.2022.104381,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2022.104381,,Jun.22,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000812885900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Exposure estimation, though, may be tricky, especially in urban areas, where large-scale surveying is generally expensive and impractical; yet, it is in urban areas that most assets are at stake when a disaster strikes. Authoritative sources such as cadastral data and business records may not be readily accessible to private stakeholders such as insurance companies; airborne and especially satellite-based Earth-Observation data obviously cannot retrieve all relevant pieces of information. Recently, a growing interest is recorded in the exploitation of street-level pictures, procured either through crowdsourcing or through specialized services like Google Street View. Pictures of building facades convey a great amount of information, but their interpretation is complex. Recently, however, smarter image analysis methods based on deep learning started appearing in literature, made possible by the increasing availability of computational power. In this paper, we leverage such methods to design a system for large-scale, systematic scanning of street-level pictures intended to map floor numbers in urban buildings. Although quite simple, this piece of information is a relevant exposure proxy in risk assessment. In the proposed system, a series of georeferenced images are automatically retrieved from the repository where they sit. A tailored deep learning net is first trained on sample images tagged through visual interpretation, and then systematically applied to the entire retrieved dataset. A specific algorithm allows attaching number of floors tags to the correct building in a dedicated GIS (Geographic Information System) layer, which is finally output by the system as an exposure proxy layer.","[Iannelli, Gianni Cristian; Dell'Acqua, Fabio] Ticinum Aerosp Srl, R&D Sect, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Dell'Acqua, Fabio] Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Ingn Ind & Informaz, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",University of Pavia,"Iannelli, GC; Dell'Acqua, F (corresponding author), Ticinum Aerosp Srl, R&D Sect, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.;Dell'Acqua, F (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Ingn Ind & Informaz, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",gc.iannelli@ticinumaerospace.com; fabio.dellacqua@unipv.it,,,,,,,,18,20,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2017,1,2,,,,,,,16,10.3390/urbansci1020016,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/urbansci1020016,,,,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000621190400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While pixelwise classification is a suitable approach to achieve this goal, state-of-the-art kernel methods are generally not applicable since training and testing phase involve large amounts of data. We address this problem by presenting a method for large-scale inference with Gaussian processes. Standard limitations of Gaussian process classifiers in terms of speed and memory are overcome by pre-clustering the data using decision trees. This leads to a breakdown of the entire problem into several independent classification tasks whose complexity is controlled by the maximum number of training examples allowed in the tree leaves. We additionally propose a technique which allows for computing multi-class probabilities by incorporating uncertainties of the classifier estimates. The approach provides pixelwise semantics for a wide range of applications and different image types such as those from scene understanding, defect localization, and remote sensing.

To begin with, a camera drone with a spiral path is employed to capture building exterior images, and photogrammetry is used to conduct three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and create mesh models for the scanned building facades. High-resolution facade orthoimages are then generated from mesh models and pixelwise segmented by an artificial intelligence (AI) model named U-net. A combined data augmentation strategy, including random flipping, rotation, resizing, perspective transformation, and color adjustment, is proposed for model training with a limited number of labels. As a result, the U-net achieves an average pixel accuracy of 0.9696 and a mean intersection over union of 0.9063 in testing. Then, the developed twoStagesClustering algorithm, with a two-round shape clustering and a two-round coordinates clustering, is used to precisely extract facade elements' dimensions and coordinates from facade orthoimages and pixelwise label. In testing with the Michigan Central Station (office tower), a historic high-rise building, the developed algorithm achieves an accuracy of 99.77% in window extraction. In addition, the extracted facade geometric information and element types are transformed into AutoCAD command and script files to create CAD drawings without manual interaction. Experimental results also show that the proposed Scan4Facade method can provide clear and accurate information to assist BIM feature creation in Revit.

To address these problems, we designed a progressive generative adversarial network in this paper. The generative network mainly contains a progressive feature generation module and an adaptive consistent attention module, and the discriminator network uses SN-PatchGAN. The network performs recursive inpainting from the edge to the centre, and the repaired features are used as the conditions for the next feature generation, which makes the constraints of the central content gradually strengthened. In order to obtain distant information from the feature maps as well as to consider the possible problem of inconsistency between feature mappings under different recursions when using attention directly in the progressive inpainting network, we designed an adaptive consistent attention module in this paper, which can adaptively combine scores obtained from different recursions to capture more feature information. The discriminator used in this paper is SN-PatchGAN, which directly calculates the hinge loss of each point on the output graph and can focus on different locations as well as different semantics.

Occlusion refers to facade of the face image which can be due to sunglasses, hair or wrapping of facial image by scarf or other accessories. Efforts on FR in controlled settings have been in the picture for past several years; however identification under uncontrolled conditions like illumination, expression and partial occlusion is quite a matter of concern.

However, since the imaging mode of SAR is side-by-side, the TomoSAR point cloud of a single orbit cannot achieve a complete observation of buildings. It is difficult for existing methods to extract the same features, as well as to use the overlap rate to achieve the alignment of the homologous TomoSAR point cloud and the cross-source TomoSAR point cloud. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust alignment method for TomoSAR point clouds in urban areas. First, noise points and outlier points are filtered by statistical filtering, and density of projection point (DoPP)-based projection is used to extract TomoSAR building point clouds and obtain the facade points for subsequent calculations based on density clustering. Subsequently, coarse alignment of source and target point clouds was performed using principal component analysis (PCA). Lastly, the rotation and translation coefficients were calculated using the angle of the normal vector of the opposite facade of the building and the distance of the outer end of the facade projection. The experimental results verify the feasibility and robustness of the proposed method. For the homologous TomoSAR point cloud, the experimental results show that the average rotation error of the proposed method was less than 0.1 degrees, and the average translation error was less than 0.25 m.

This leads to a decrease in the revenue associated with commercial activities or services (e.g., shops, restaurants, residences), and potentially reduces tourism in a region. Visual data, in the form of photographs, is becoming an efficient mechanism to record information. Photographs can be quickly captured, and are already frequently posted online by ordinary citizens (e.g., tourists, residents, visitors). Exploiting image data through automation and computer vision provides a new opportunity to simplify the current manual graffiti-monitoring processes, enabling automated detection, localization, and quantification of such markings. In this study, we developed a vision-based graffiti-detection technique using a convolutional neural network. Images collected from historical structures of interest within a community can be utilized to automatically inspect for graffiti markings. In the case in which citizens collect and contribute data, there is a high degree of duplication and repetition, and potentially a lack of GPS information. These hinder the direct use of the images for automating the process. To address these challenges, we built high-resolution, single-view facade images (orthophotos) before applying our robust graffiti detector. The robust graffiti detector was built using a database with 1022 images of damaged or contaminated structures gathered during a recent European Union project, entitled Safeguarding Cultural Heritage through Technical and Organisational Resources Management (STORM). A total of 818 images were used for training (10% of the training set was randomly chosen for the validation set), achieving 88% accuracy among the remaining 204 samples for testing. Using the trained detector, the technique developed was demonstrated using data collected from the Church of Agios Nikolaos (Leontariou), Kantza, Greece.","[Choi, Jongseong; Ortiz, Ricardo] State Univ New York, Dept Mech Engn, SUNY Korea, Incheon 21985, South Korea; [Choi, Jongseong] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Mech Engn, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Toumanidis, Lazaros; Charalampos, Patrikakis; Kasnesis, Panagiotis] Univ West Attica, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Egaleo 12241, Greece; [Yeum, Chul Min] Univ Waterloo, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 2G1, Canada; [Lenjani, Ali] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Liu, Xiaoyu; Dyke, Shirley J.] Purdue Univ, Sch Mech Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Jiang, Ning-Jun] Southeast Univ, Inst Geotech Engn, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China; [Dyke, Shirley J.] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of West Attica; University of Waterloo; Stanford University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Southeast University - China; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Choi, J (corresponding author), State Univ New York, Dept Mech Engn, SUNY Korea, Incheon 21985, South Korea.;Choi, J (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Mech Engn, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",jongseong.choi@stonybrook.edu; laztoum@uniwa.gr; cmyeum@uwaterloo.ca; bpatr@uniwa.gr; alenjani@stanford.edu; liu1787@purdue.edu; pkasnesis@uniwa.gr; ricardo.ortiz@stonybrook.edu; jiangn@seu.edu.cn; sdyke@purdue.edu,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2022,12,6,,,,,,,2983,10.3390/app12062983,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app12062983,,,,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000776023200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The growing availability of street view images presents new prospects in identifying urban features. However, the reliability and consistency of these methods across different locations and time remains largely unexplored. We aim to develop a comprehensive index of urban quality and change at the street segment level using Google Street View (GSV) imagery. We focus on eight object classes that indicate urban decay or contribute to an unsightly urban space, such as potholes, graffiti, garbage, tents, barred or broken windows, discolored or dilapidated facades, weeds, and utility markings. We train an object detection model on a dataset of images from different cities and assess the performance of these urban indices. We evaluate the effectiveness of this method in various urban contexts over time and discuss its potential for urban planning and public policy.

However, various methods are elaborately designed for glass or transparent object detection in natural images but not for glass facades in oblique aerial images. In oblique aerial images, glass facade panels with salient boundaries are spatially related and have various sizes and appearances. For the glass facade segmentation task, we notice that semantic and instance segmentation methods have different strengths and failures. To get the best of both worlds, this letter presents an ensemble method to segment glass facades in oblique aerial images. A novel annotation strategy is adopted to preserve the spatial relationship between glass facade panels, and edge features are extracted to improve the detector's performance. Furthermore, we contribute a glass facade segmentation dataset (GFSD) to evaluate our method, which is a supplement to UAV image datasets.

This paper discusses the possibility of applying advanced image recognition algorithms to the classification of the modern Harbin architectural facade styles and argues that the keys to the classification and positioning of the styles are the forms, the details, and the decorative patterns of the architectural facades, together with the deformation and the quantitative variation factors of the facade decoration symbols. Based on the conventional classification method, the facade styles of Harbin modern architecture were divided into 12 categories after data analysis. To better capture the overall structure information and the style features of the local components in the architectural images, the group convolution and the dilated convolution were added into the ResNet model, and then, the improved channel attention mechanism was introduced to construct a novel CA-MSResNet model. The CA-MSResNet model could more accurately identify the morphological elements and the style categories of the architectures, and the average accuracy reached 87.5%.

This work tackles the problem of locating floor-level lines in street-view images, using a supervised deep learning approach. Unfortunately, very little data is available for training such a network - current street-view datasets contain either semantic annotations that lack geometric attributes, or rectified facades without perspective priors. To address this issue, we first compile a new dataset and develop a new data augmentation scheme to synthesize training samples by harassing (i) the rich semantics of existing rectified facades and (ii) perspective priors of buildings in diverse street views. Next, we design FloorLevel-Net, a multi-task learning network that associates explicit features of building facades and implicit floor-level lines, along with a height-attention mechanism to help enforce a vertical ordering of floor-level lines. The generated segmentations are then passed to a second-stage geometry post-processing to exploit self-constrained geometric priors for plausible and consistent reconstruction of floor-level lines. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations conducted on assorted facades in existing datasets and street views from Google demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Also, we present context-aware image overlay results and show the potentials of our approach in enriching AR-related applications.

Since manual inspection is expensive, time consuming and risky, low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles or robots can be leveraged as a viable alternative for quick reconnaissance. Visual data captured by the sensors mounted on the robots can be analyzed, and the damages can be detected and classified autonomously. The present study proposes the use of deep learning-based approaches to this end. Region-based convolutional neural network (Faster RCNN) is exploited to detect four different damage types, namely, surface crack, spalling (which includes facade spalling and concrete spalling), and severe damage with exposed rebars and severely buckled rebars. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on manually annotated image data collected from reinforced concrete buildings damaged under several past earthquakes such as Nepal (2015), Taiwan (2016), Ecuador (2016), Erzincan (1992), Duzce (1999), Bingol (2003), Peru (2007), Wenchuan (2008), and Haiti (2010). Several experiments are presented in the paper to illustrate the capabilities, as well as the limitations, of the proposed approach for earthquake reconnaissance.

Manually collected data from mobile phone and web-scraped images also cover the dense regions, which are generally not covered in GSV. Hence, it helps the generation of accurate maps. We first applied a pretrained Inception-ResNet-v2 model to detect the building instances from training images of various Indian cities. The extracted building instances were manually labeled as different usage class (residential, commercial, industrial, and others) to develop the classification training set. EfficientNet-B7, a Deep Learning (DL) model leveraged the facade features in the training process to predict the usage class of the building instances. The model achieved an accuracy of 81% on training and 77% on test sets. The predictions were attributed with building footprint using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to prepare building usage maps for various cities in India. Although the model faced challenges in predicting a lot of buildings with similar facade, we still found it to be robust in predicting the usage of buildings across various geography.

This paper proposes facade datasets that are efficiently constructed by quickly collecting facade data through road-view images generated from web portals and automatically labeled using deep learning as part of the construction of image datasets for visual recognition construction by a computer. Therefore, we attempted to automatically label facade images to quickly generate large-scale facade datasets with much less effort than the existing research methods. Simultaneously, we constructed datasets for a part of Dongseong-ro, Daegu Metropolitan City, and analyzed their utility and reliability. It was confirmed that the computer could extract significant facade information from the road-view images by recognizing the visual information of the facade image. In addition, we verified the characteristics of the building construction image datasets. This study suggests the possibility of securing quantitative and qualitative facade design knowledge by extracting facade design information from facades anywhere in the world. Previous studies mainly collected facade images through camera photography to construct databases, but in this study, a significant part of the database construction process was shortened through automation. In the case of facade automatic image labeling studies, it is the facade-based automatic 3D modeling which has been primarily studied, but it is difficult to find a study to extract data for facade design research.","[Gu, Hyeongmo; Choo, Seungyeon] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Architecture, 80 Daehak Ro, Daegu 41566, South Korea",Kyungpook National University,"Choo, S (corresponding author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Architecture, 80 Daehak Ro, Daegu 41566, South Korea.",ghm3186@knu.ac.kr; choo@knu.ac.kr,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2022,12,15,,,,,,,7570,10.3390/app12157570,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app12157570,,,,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000839349400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent works show SISM provides semantic-aware auxiliary information for better style or structure manipulations. Providing structural assistance, segmentation maps have been broadly used as an intermediate interface to achieve better image manipulation. Mainstream solutions of image manipulation use Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) globally, locally or jointly. It is also applicable to SISM. However, the discriminator of global GAN is easier fooled, because the majority of its input is the same as the ground-truth, which is hard to fully mitigate the inconsistency between inpainted areas and the context. The inconsistency is more difficult for local GAN to address, due to the lack of context in its input. To mitigate the inconsistency, we propose a novel Multi-Expansion (MEx) loss. It is implemented by the adversarial loss on MEx areas. Each MEx area has the inpainted area as dominance and keeps knowledge of the scene context, so the consistency of the SISM results can be boosted. We propose an approximation of MEx loss, i.e., A-MEx loss, to further enhance the stability and usability. Besides performing well on SISM tasks, MEx loss also performs impressively on natural image inpainting. Extensive experiments on the two tasks demonstrate the advantages of our model over existing methods on four challenging datasets, such as a 2.59% increase in Hamm on SISM in Cityscape and a decrease of 5.00% FID on natural image inpainting in CMP Facade.

Then, guided by the uncertainty, we propose an occlusion-immune facade parsing architecture in which we progressively re-express the features of pixels in each contaminated region from easy to hard. Specifically, the outside pixels, which have reliable context from visible areas, are re-expressed at early stages; the inner pixels are processed at late stages when their surroundings have been decontaminated at the earlier stages. In addition, at each stage, instead of using regular square convolution kernels, we design a context enhancement module (CEM) with directional strip kernels, which can aggregate structural context to re-express facade pixels.

However, the study of real-time, noncontact measurements of personal thermal comfort and the corresponding control system is not comprehensive. This paper aims to propose a workflow to design an adaptive facade that considers occupants' glare and thermal discomfort. From 280 valid questionnaires, the correlation between 13 defined postures and glare and thermal discomfort was determined. A CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is introduced to build a model to identify user behaviours. By taking the key point coordinates parsed by the OpenPose algorithm as input, the CNN-based model can recognize the 13 defined postures and a Sitting  type. An adaptive facade control system is proposed based on the captured occupant postures and spatial position. Validation results from volunteers showed that the CNN-based model could recognize user postures and respond immediately. After training for 40 epochs using 1260 videos as the training set, a model with 0.121 cross-entropy loss on the validation set was selected, and its accuracy reached 91.67% in the test. The adaptive facade units and the HVAC system are dynamically adjusted based on the extracted discomfort states. The set opening factor changes in steps of 0.1, and the set temperature of the HVAC system changes in steps of 1 degrees C at 15 min intervals. This allows the potential to build a personalized visual and thermal environment, which helps to improve the visual and thermal comfort of occupants.","[Wang, Yuxiao; Han, Yunsong; Wu, Yuran; Zhou, Zhibo] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuxiao; Han, Yunsong; Wu, Yuran; Zhou, Zhibo] Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Key Lab Cold Reg Urban & Rural Human Settlement E, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Korkina, Elena; Gagarin, Vladimir] Russian Acad Architecture & Construct Sci, Res Inst Bldg Phys, Moscow 127238, Russia; [Korkina, Elena; Gagarin, Vladimir] Moscow State Univ Civil Engn MGSU, Moscow 129337, Russia",Harbin Institute of Technology; Moscow State University of Civil Engineering,"Han, YS (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",hanyunsong@hit.edu.cn,,,,,,,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,Apr.15,2022,214,,,,,,,,108907,10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.108907,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.108907,,Feb.22,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000780379000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The majority of contributions aimed at identifying debris and rubble piles, as the main focus is to assess collapsed and partially collapsed structures. However, these approaches might not be optimal for the image classification of facade damages, where damages might appear in the form of spalling, cracks and collapse of small segments of the facade. A few studies focused their damage detection on the facades using only post-event images. Nonetheless, several studies achieved better performances in damage detection approaches when considering multi-temporal image data. Hence, in this work a multi-temporal facade damage detection is tested. The first objective is to optimally merge pre- and post-event aerial oblique imagery within a supervised classification approach using convolutional neural networks to detect facade damages. The second objective is related to the fact that facades are normally depicted in several views in aerial manned photogrammetric surveys; hence, different procedures combining these multi-view image data are also proposed and embedded in the image classification approach. Six multi-temporal approaches are compared against 3 mono-temporal ones. The results indicate the superiority of multi-temporal approaches (up to similar to 25% in f1-score) when compared to the mono-temporal ones. The best performing multi-temporal approach takes as input sextuples (3 views per epoch, per facade) within a late fusion approach to perform the image classification of facade damages. However, the detection of small damages, such as smaller cracks or smaller areas of spalling, remains challenging in this approach, mainly due to the low resolution (similar to 0.14 m ground sampling distance) of the dataset used.","[Duarte, Diogo; Nex, Francesco; Kerle, Norman; Vosselman, George] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, Enschede, Netherlands; [Duarte, Diogo] Univ Coimbra, Dept Math, Coimbra, Portugal; [Duarte, Diogo] Univ Coimbra, Inst Syst Engn & Comp Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal",University of Twente; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra,"Duarte, D (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, Enschede, Netherlands.;Duarte, D (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Dept Math, Coimbra, Portugal.;Duarte, D (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Inst Syst Engn & Comp Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.",d.duarte@utwente.nl,,,,,,,,10,10,,,,,,,,,,,Jul.03,2020,57,5,,,,,670,686,,10.1080/15481603.2020.1768768,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2020.1768768,,May.20,,"Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000540114900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Due to the fact that these environments can grow even more over time, applications related to their monitoring tend to turn to autonomous intelligent systems, which together with remote sensing data could help or even predict daily life situations. The task of mapping cities by autonomous operators was usually carried out by aerial optical images due to its scale and resolution; however new scientific questions have arisen, and this has led research into a new era of highly-detailed data extraction. For many years, using artificial neural models to solve complex problems such as automatic image classification was commonplace, owing much of their popularity to their ability to adapt to complex situations without needing human intervention. In spite of that, their popularity declined in the mid-2000s, mostly due to the complex and time-consuming nature of their methods and workflows. However, newer neural network architectures have brought back the interest in their application for autonomous classifiers, especially for image classification purposes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been a trend for pixel-wise image segmentation, showing flexibility when detecting and classifying any kind of object, even in situations where humans failed to perceive differences, such as in city scenarios. In this paper, we aim to explore and experiment with state-of-the-art technologies to semantically label 3D urban models over complex scenarios. To achieve these goals, we split the problem into two main processing lines: first, how to correctly label the facade features in the 2D domain, where a supervised CNN is used to segment ground-based facade images into six feature classes, roof, window, wall, door, balcony and shop; second, a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) workflow is used to extract the geometry of the facade, wherein the segmented images in the previous stage are then used to label the generated mesh by a reverse ray-tracing technique. This paper demonstrates that the proposed methodology is robust in complex scenarios. The facade feature inferences have reached up to 93% accuracy over most of the datasets used. Although it still presents some deficiencies in unknown architectural styles and needs some improvements to be made regarding 3D-labeling, we present a consistent and simple methodology to handle the problem.","[Lotte, Rodolfo Georjute; de Aragao, Luiz Eduardo Oliveira e Cruz; Shimabukuro, Yosio Edemir] Natl Inst Space Res, Remote Sensing Div, Av Astronautas 1758, BR-12227010 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil; [Haala, Norbert] Univ Stuttgart, IfP, Geschwister Scholl Str 24D, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany; [Karpina, Mateusz] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Geodesy & Geoinformat, Norwida 25, PL-50375 Wroclaw, Poland; [de Aragao, Luiz Eduardo Oliveira e Cruz] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE); University of Stuttgart; Institute of Geodesy & Cartography; Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences; University of Exeter,"Lotte, RG (corresponding author), Natl Inst Space Res, Remote Sensing Div, Av Astronautas 1758, BR-12227010 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil.",lotte@dsr.inpe.br; norbert.haala@ifp.uni-stuttgart.de; mateusz.karpina@igig.up.wroc.pl; laragao@dsr.inpe.br; yosio@dsr.inpe.br,,,,,,,,13,13,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2018,10,9,,,,,,,1435,10.3390/rs10091435,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10091435,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000449993800115,View Full Record in Web of Science

To facilitate the installation of PV modules at solar abundant locations, an accurate estimation of solar PV spatial potential is indispensable. Solar energy could be reflected on high-albedo building surfaces inside the urban canyon. However, using conventional ways to construct albedo datasets for different building surfaces is extremely labor-intense. In this work, we proposed to use semantic segmentation to identify facade materials from street view images. Due to the distinguishable features between materials in terms of the subtle texture and patterns rather than just their shapes and colors, identification requires more details from images, which makes multi-scale inference structure a promising solution. Compared with existing methods combining scales features at pixel-level, we proposed a novel Multi-Scale Contextual Attention Network (MSCA), using a Multi-Scale Object-Contextual Representation (OCR) block to exploit and combine contextual information from different scales in high dimensional layers. The experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing models, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIOU) of 70.23%. The results indicate that the MSCA can effectively obtain the materials information from street views and can be a reliable solution to providing urban albedo information for solar estimation.","[Xu, Fan; Wong, Man Sing; Heo, Joon; Shi, Guoqiang] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hung Hom, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Rui] ASTAR, Inst High Performance Comp IHPC, 1 Fusionopolis Way, Singapore 138632, Singapore; [Heo, Joon] Yonsei Univ, Coll Engn, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 134 Shinchondong, Seoul 03722, South Korea",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC); Yonsei University,"Wong, MS (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hung Hom, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China.",fanfan.xu@connect.polyu.hk; ls.charles@polyu.edu.hk; zhur@ihpc.a-star.edu.sg; jheo@yonsei.ac.kr; guoqiang.shi@polyu.edu.hk,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2023,202,,,,,,158,168,,10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2023.06.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2023.06.001,,Jun.23,,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:001024036200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study proposes the orthofacade-based assisted inspection method (AIM), universal and applicable to different types of facade cladding and suitable for application in the condition assessment of inaccessible building facades or high-rise and large structures of all kinds. The AIM method offers a multidisciplinary approach by combining unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, electronic tachymetry, and digital image processing techniques (photogrammetry and open-source computer vision methods). The method was verified in a case study performed on a high-rise building facade. On-site data acquisition of high-resolution images of facade and control points was conducted by UAV and tachymetry. The data were further processed in photogrammetric software in order to generate a georeferenced orthofacade. Crack detection was performed at pixel level via computer code using the OpenCV library methods. The established diagnostic model, defined by control points, enables precise determination of crack location. Crack length, width, or area could be calculated based on the coordinates of its points, by performing simple mathematical operations. The AIM method provides automation of crack detection and precise determination of location and geometrical parameters of detected crack.","[Dragani, Suzana; Popov, Srdan; Laban, Mirjana; Markovic, Marko Z.; Lukic, Ivan; Malesev, Mirjana; Radonjanin, Vlastimir] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 6, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Laban, M (corresponding author), Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 6, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",suzanav@uns.ac.rs; srdjanpopov@uns.ac.rs; mlaban@uns.ac.rs; marko_m@uns.ac.rs; lookic@uns.ac.rs; miram@uns.ac.rs; radonv@uns.ac.rs,,,,,,,,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2022,12,11,,,,,,,5626,10.3390/app12115626,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app12115626,,,,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000809162900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given the heterogeneity of urban land-use types, it is difficult to differentiate different land-use types based on overhead remotely sensed data. Google Street View (GSV) images, which capture the facades of building blocks along streets, could be better used to judge the land-use types of different building blocks based on their facade appearances. Recently developed scene classification algorithms in computer vision community make it possible to categorize different photos semantically based on various image feature descriptors and machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a method to derive detailed land-use information at building block level based on scene classification algorithms and GSV images. Three image feature descriptors (i.e., scale-invariant feature transform-Fisher, histogram of oriented gradients, GIST) were used to represent GSV images of different buildings. Existing land-use maps were used to create training datasets to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for categorizing GSV images. The trained SVM classifiers were then applied to case study areas in New York City, Boston, and Houston, to predict the land-use information at building block level. Accuracy assessment results show that the proposed method is suitable for differentiating residential buildings and nonresidential buildings with an accuracy of 85% or so. Since the GSV images are publicly accessible, this proposed method would provide a new way for building block level land-use mapping in future.","[Li, Xiaojiang] MIT, Senseable City Lab, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zhang, Chuanrong; Li, Weidong] Univ Connecticut, Dept Geog, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Connecticut,"Li, XJ (corresponding author), MIT, Senseable City Lab, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Zhang, CR (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Geog, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",xiaojian@mit.edu,,,,,,,,61,72,,,,,,,,,,,,2017,54,6,,,,,819,835,,10.1080/15481603.2017.1338389,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2017.1338389,,,,"Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000416534800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the widely used simulation-based design is facing several challenges, such as the labor-intensive modeling process and the performance gaps between design stage estimations and operational energy use. For these reasons, artificial intelligent methods are expected by designers to improve the efficiency and reliability of building energy-efficient design. To date, there has not been a practical data-driven design method of envelopes. This study aimed at exploring data-driven building energy-efficient design of envelopes based on their quantified impacts. A feature selection method and a game-theoretic method were applied to quantify the impacts of envelopes on space heating and cooling energy, which were performed on two building datasets, one of which is from the U.S. and the other from China. Random forest classifiers were developed to conduct the study. Based on discovered energy patterns and quantified impacts of envelopes on energy consumption, a rectified linear design method of envelopes was proposed with the idea of improving the performance of high-impact envelopes. Besides, a validation study was conducted on two office buildings in the hot-summer cold-winter region. To design the envelopes of a building, the data-driven analysis was driven by its similar buildings other than the whole dataset. Moreover, a detailed energy simulation was conducted to evaluate the energy performance of different design solutions. The results showed that compared with baseline design solutions, new strategies could save 1.05%-21.2% energy for space heating and cooling for these two case buildings. The proposed method is a general building envelope design approach and allows designers to easily find an energy-efficient configuration of envelopes. This study demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the data-driven energy-efficient design of building envelopes.","[Tian, Zhichao; Shi, Xing] Tongji Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Tian, Zhichao; Shi, Xing] Tongji Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ecol & Energy Saving Study Dense Habitat, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Hong, Sung-Min] UCL, Inst Environm Design & Engn, London, England",Tongji University; Tongji University; University of London; University College London,"Shi, X (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ecol & Energy Saving Study Dense Habitat, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",20101@tongji.edu.cn,,,,,,,,17,17,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2021,42,,,,,,,,103018,10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103018,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103018,,Aug.21,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000689231800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The proposed method incorporates multilevel appearance and disparity features in a binary discriminative model, and generates a set of candidate planes by sampling and clustering points from the image with Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), using local normal estimates derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to inform the planar models. These two models are incorporated into a two-layer Markov Random Field (MRF): an appearance- and disparity-based discriminative classifier at the mid-level, and a geometric model to segment the building pixels into facades at the high-level.

While this problem is well-studied in the literature, most of the existing studies are either qualitative or minimally driven quantitative studies that rely on localized building envelope points and are, thus, not suitable for automated solutions in energy audit applications. This research work is an attempt to fill this gap of knowledge by utilizing intensive thermal data (on the order of 100,000 plus images) and constitutes a relatively new area of analysis in energy audit applications. Specifically, we demonstrate a novel process using deep-learning methods to segment more than 100,000 thermal images collected from an unmanned aerial system (UAS). To quantify the heat loss for a building envelope, multiple stages of computations need to be performed: object detection (using Mask-RCNN/Faster R-CNN), estimating the surface temperature (using two clustering methods), and finally calculating the overall heat transfer coefficient (e.g., the U-value). The proposed model was applied to eleven academic campuses across the state of North Dakota. The preliminary findings indicate that Mask R-CNN outperformed other instance segmentation models with an mIOU of 73% for facades, 55% for windows, 67% for roofs, 24% for doors, and 11% for HVACs. Two clustering methods, namely K-means and threshold-based clustering (TBC), were deployed to estimate surface temperatures with TBC providing consistent estimates across all times of the day over K-means.

By measuring the time-averaged volume of the fire, Visual Fire Power can measure heat release rate in situations where traditional calorimetry may be impractical (such as experiments outdoors), as well as uniquely providing a method for comparing the heat release rates of different flames in the same experiment, e.g. externally venting flames from different windows of the same compartment. The algorithm was benchmarked against synthetic data and calculated the volume of common solids with approximately 30% uncertainty. The relationship between volume and heat release rate was then calibrated from videos of burners at known heat release rates. These experiments were used to calculate the Orloff-DeRis constant c, which linearly relates flame volume and heat release rate. The value for c was found to be 1505 +/- 183 kW/m(3). The algorithm was demonstrated on recordings of a standard Polish facade fire test. Improving the range of data measured in both fire testing and fire experiments could help to increase our knowledge of fire dynamics and provide better data for researchers and engineers in the future.","[Bonner, Matthew; Rein, Guillermo] Imperial Coll London, Dept Mech Engn, London, England; [Bonner, Matthew] Trigon Fire Safety Ltd, London, England; [Wegrzynski, Wojciech] Inst Tech Budowlanej ITB, Warsaw, Poland",Imperial College London; Instytut Techniki Budowlanej,"Rein, G (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Mech Engn, London, England.",g.rein@imperial.ac.uk,,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2023,59,1,,,SI,,191,215,,10.1007/s10694-022-01341-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10694-022-01341-z,,Dec.22,,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000896439700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The application steps are: First, acquire POI (point of interest) coordinates of consumption places to obtain street-view images; then, 30 respondents of each gender are invited to score the sampled images. The area proportions of four prominent visual elements in the building facade are identified by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), after which Random Forest Model is applied to predict the preference scores of all POIs. Finally, the distribution equity of the consumption places of each gender is evaluated by Equilibrium Index. Applying this method in Beijing, we can identify the gender divergence in four aspects of form, function, scale, and administrative district, locate the area with a poor supply of consumption places, and finally provide optimisation suggestions.

Survey of traditional masonry also ostensibly conforms to this approach but, due to the sheer volume of masonry units composing walls, it is often prohibitively time consuming, exceptionally complex and ultimately costly. Notable features of such survey work for ashlar stone types require each stone to be labelled and overlaid with information relative to condition. Further hindering these already costly operations, it has been shown that the accuracy of reporting, including labelling the manifestation of defects and defect diagnosis, is subjective, depending upon the expertise and experience of those evaluating the fabric. Moving beyond these preliminary survey and reporting stages, this situation gives rise to variable repair and maintenance strategies that can have significant cost implications and can debase fundamental conservation activities. The development of digital technologies, such as terrestrial laser scanning, and advancements in novel computer vision statistical techniques can help produce accurate representation of buildings that can be subsequently rapidly processed, achieving many tangible survey functions with greater inherent objectivity. In this paper, an innovative strategy for automatic detection and classification of defects in digitised ashlar masonry walling is presented. The classification method is based on the use of supervised machine learning algorithms, assisted by surveyors' strategies and expertise to identify defective individual masonry units, through to broader global patterns for groups of stones. The proposed approach has been tested on the main facade of the Chapel Royal in Stirling Castle (Scotland), demonstrating its potential for ashlar masonry forms of wall construction. It is important to recognise that the findings are not limited to this culturally significant building and will be of high value to almost innumerable ashlar-built structures worldwide. The research ultimately attempts to reduce the degree of subjectivity in classifying defects, on a scale and rapidity hitherto beyond traditional project cost constraints. Importantly, it is recognised that through automation more effective utilisation of resources that would have been traditionally spent on survey can be redeployed to support fabric intervention or routine maintenance operations.","[Valero, Enrique; Bosche, Frederic] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Inst Infrastruct & Environm, Edinburgh EH9 3FB, Midlothian, Scotland; [Forster, Alan] Heriot Watt Univ, Inst Sustainable Bldg Design, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hyslop, Ewan; Wilson, Lyn; Turmel, Aurelie] Hist Environm Scotland, Salisbury Pl,Longmore House, Edinburgh EH9 1SH, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh; Heriot Watt University,"Valero, E (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Inst Infrastruct & Environm, Edinburgh EH9 3FB, Midlothian, Scotland.",e.valero@ed.ac.uk,,,,,,,,71,72,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2019,106,,,,,,,,102846,10.1016/j.autcon.2019.102846,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2019.102846,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000488136600014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Unfortunately, the amount of effort required to label the data has significantly hindered the application of deep learning methods, especially in 3D modelling tasks requiring heterogeneous samples. This paper proposes a semi-supervised adversarial recognition strategy embedded in the inverse procedural modelling engine to reduce data annotation costs for learning to model 3D facades. Beginning with textured level-of-details models, we use convolutional neural networks to recognise the types and estimate the parameters of windows from image patches. The window types and parameters are then assembled into the procedural grammar. A simple procedural engine is built inside off-the-shelf 3D modelling software, producing fine-grained window geometries. To obtain a useful model from a few labelled samples, we leverage a generative adversarial network to train the feature extractor in a semi-supervised manner.

This paper develops an integrated, computational GIS-based information system to provide automated storage, retrieval, detection, assessment, and documentation of facade anomalies based on UAV-captured data.

A real-world case was studied to present the procedure and advances in the management and analysis of multisourced inspection data to automate UAV-based facade diagnosis. As a result, the proposed method facilitates the seamless fusion, processing, visualization, and documentation of multimodal inspection data, resulting in convenient analysis with discrepancies measured in decimeters for length, millimeters for width, and centimeters for geoposition.

Therefore, they represent an important source of information for first responders or other stakeholders involved in the post-disaster response process. Several automated methods based on supervised learning have already been demonstrated for damage detection using oblique airborne images. However, they often do not generalize well when data from new unseen sites need to be processed, hampering their practical use. Reasons for this limitation include image and scene characteristics, though the most prominent one relates to the image features being used for training the classifier. Recently features based on deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been shown to be more effective than conventional hand-crafted features, and have become the state-of-the-art in many domains, including remote sensing. Moreover, often oblique images are captured with high block overlap, facilitating the generation of dense 3D point clouds - an ideal source to derive geometric characteristics. We hypothesized that the use of CNN features, either independently or in combination with 3D point cloud features, would yield improved performance in damage detection. To this end we used CNN and 3D features, both independently and in combination, using images from manned and unmanned aerial platforms over several geographic locations that vary significantly in terms of image and scene characteristics. A multiple-kernel-learning framework, an effective way for integrating features from different modalities, was used for combining the two sets of features for classification. The results are encouraging: while CNN features produced an average classification accuracy of about 91%, the integration of 3D point cloud features led to an additional improvement of about 3% (i.e. an average classification accuracy of 94%). The significance of 3D point cloud features becomes more evident in the model transferability scenario (i.e., training and testing samples from different sites that vary slightly in the aforementioned characteristics), where the integration of CNN and 3D point cloud features significantly improved the model transferability accuracy up to a maximum of 7% compared with the accuracy achieved by CNN features alone. Overall, an average accuracy of 85% was achieved for the model transferability scenario across all experiments. Our main conclusion is that such an approach qualifies for practical use.","[Vetrivel, Anand; Kerle, Norman; Nex, Francesco; Vosselman, George] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Gerke, Markus] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Geodesy & Photogrammetry, Pockelsstr 3, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany",University of Twente; Braunschweig University of Technology,"Vetrivel, A (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",a.vetrivel@utwente.nl; m.gerke@tu-bs.de; n.kerle@utwente.nl; f.nex@utwente.nl; george.vosselman@utwente.nl,,,,,,,,178,194,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2018,140,,,,,,45,59,,10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2017.03.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2017.03.001,,,,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,Y,N,16.01.2024,WOS:000433015900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, laser-scanned point clouds are often difficult to analyze, visualize, and interpret due to incompletely scanned building facades caused by numerous sources of defects such as noise, occlusions, and moving objects. Several point cloud scene completion algorithms have been proposed in the literature, but they have been mostly applied to individual objects or small-scale indoor environments and not on large-scale scans of building facades. This paper introduces a method of performing point cloud scene completion of building facades using orthographic projection and generative adversarial inpainting methods. The point cloud is first converted into the 2D structured representation of depth and color images using an orthographic projection approach. Then, a data-driven 2D inpainting approach is used to predict the complete version of the scene, given the incomplete scene in the image domain. The 2D inpainting process is fully automated and uses a customized generative-adversarial network based on Pix2Pix that is trainable end-to-end. The inpainted 2D image is finally converted back into a 3D point cloud using depth remapping. The proposed method is compared against several baseline methods, including geometric methods such as Poisson reconstruction and hole-filling, as well as learning-based methods such as the point completion network (PCN) and TopNet. Performance evaluation is carried out based on the task of reconstructing real-world building facades from partial laser-scanned point clouds.

Here, the suitability and geometric accuracy of four UAV-based image acquisition and data processing scenarios for topographic surveying applications in complex terrain are assessed and compared. The specific cases include the use of: 1) nadir imagery; 2) nadir and oblique imagery; 3) nadir and facade imagery; and 4) nadir, oblique, and facade imagery to reconstruct a topographically complex natural surface. Results illustrate that including oblique and facade imagery to supplement the more traditional nadir collections significantly improves the geometric accuracy of point cloud data reconstruction by approximately 35% when assessed against terrestrial laser scanning data of near-vertical rock walls. Most points (99.41%) had distance errors of less than 50 cm between the point clouds derived from the nadir imagery and nadir-oblique-facade imagery. Apart from delivering enhanced spatial resolution in facade details, the geometric accuracy improvements achieved from integrating nadir, oblique, and facade imagery provide value for a range of applications, including geotechnical and geohazard investigations.

In this research, a method for building facade element extraction based on multidimensional virtual semantic feature map ensemble learning and hierarchical clustering is proposed. Point clouds were obtained by multi-view images, and then the multidimensional virtual semantic feature maps, including color, texture, orientation, and curvature semantics, were acquired via reprojection. The multi-semantic feature block pre-segmentation, considering multiple features, was obtained by ensemble learning, and a hierarchical clustering strategy was established for to achieve fine extraction of building facade elements. Experiments were conducted across multiple building types, and the results showed that: 1) The method can use different virtual semantic feature map and clustering strategies to achieve accurate extraction of diverse building facade elements; 2) The method achieved joint learning tasks in both 2D and 3D space; and, 3) The proposed method achieved fine extraction of building elements with pixel accuracy (PA) over 70% in all experiments and mean intersection over union (mIoU) up to 95%, which were better than the image based method.

We make use of four recent large-scale fires in Sweden to elucidate which factors are important for survival, using multiple logistic regression analysis of data collected at the sites. We obtained data on 187 buildings within the fire perimeters, nearly all with wood paneling and tile- or sheet metal roofing. 35 % of the buildings were lost or badly damaged. Results indicate that most buildings were approached by relatively low-intensity fire and that ignition primarily occurred through direct flame contact. The most important factor for survivability was the presence of a maintained lawn. The second most important was that no flammable material was present close to the building facade. Further, fire intensity often decreased close to buildings due to a larger portion of deciduous trees around gardens than in the surrounding forest. These factors were more important than specific features of the building itself, reflecting that the majority of buildings have combustible wooden facades. Our results suggest that the greatest potential for increasing building safety in the Swedish WUI is to keep the area immediately surrounding the building (similar to 5 m) free from tree litter and other flammable material. Also, since fire intensities are generally low, buildings can in most cases be defended with simple tools without compromising personal safety.","[Plathner, Frida Vermina; Sjostrom, Johan] RISE Res Inst Sweden, Dept Fire Technol, Box 857, S-50115 Boras, Sweden; [Granstrom, Anders] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden",RISE Research Institutes of Sweden; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Plathner, FV (corresponding author), RISE Res Inst Sweden, Dept Fire Technol, Box 857, S-50115 Boras, Sweden.",frida.vermina.plathner@ri.se,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2023,157,,,,,,,,105928,10.1016/j.ssci.2022.105928,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2022.105928,,Sep.22,,"Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000860978200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The energy performance of two competing facade systems (i.e., Ultra-High-Performance Fiber-Reinforced-Concrete and conventional panels) was estimated for different scenarios through building en-ergy simulations using EnergyPlusrm. Three deep learning networks were trained using the collected data from the simulation of fourteen buildings in fourteen different locations to estimate the heating, cooling, and total site energy savings. The accuracy of trained deep networks was compared with the accuracy of three common data-driven prediction models including, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, and Generalized Linear Regression. The results showed that the deep learning network trained to predict building total site energy savings had the highest accuracy among other models with a mean absolute error of 1.59 and a root mean square error of 3.48, followed by Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, and last Generalized Linear Regression. Similarly, deep networks trained to predict building cooling and heating energy savings had the lowest mean average error of 0.20 and 1.17, respectively, compared to other predictive models. It is expected the decision support system developed based on this methodology helps architects and designers to quantify the energy savings of different facade systems in early stages of design decisions.","[Abediniangerabi, B.; Shahandashti, M.] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Civil Engn, 416 S Yates St, Arlington, TX 76010 USA; [Makhmalbaf, A.] Univ Texas Arlington, Sch Architecture, 601 W Nedderman Dr, Arlington, TX 76010 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Abediniangerabi, B (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Civil Engn, 416 S Yates St, Arlington, TX 76010 USA.",bahram.abediniangerabi@uta.edu; atefe.makhmalbaf@uta.edu; mohsen@uta.edu,,,,,,,,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2021,5,,,,,,,,100077,10.1016/j.egyai.2021.100077,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egyai.2021.100077,,,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Energy & Fuels",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:001058083100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

One of the most important parameters for determining transmission losses is thermal transmittance. Although thermal transmittance does not take into account dynamic parameters, it is traditionally the most commonly used estimation of transmission losses due to its simplicity and efficiency. It is challenging to estimate the thermal transmittance of an existing building element because thermal properties are commonly unknown or not all the layers that make up the element can be found due to technical-drawing information loss. In such cases, experimental methods are essential, the most common of which is the heat-flux method (HFM). One of the main drawbacks of the HFM is the long measurement duration. This research presents the application of deep learning on HFM results by applying long-short term memory units on temperature difference and measured heat flux. This deep-learning regression problem predicts heat flux after the applied model is properly trained on temperature-difference input, which is backpropagated by measured heat flux. The paper shows the performance of the developed procedure on real-size walls under the simulated environmental conditions, while the possibility of practical application is shown in pilot in-situ measurements.","[Gumbarevi, Sanjin] Ericsson Nikola Tesla, Krapinska 45, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Milovanovi, Bojan; Gasi, Mergim] Univ Zagreb, Fac Civil Engn, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Basi, Bojana Dalbelo] Univ Zagreb, Fac Elect Engn & Comp, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Ericsson; University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb,"Gumbarevi, S (corresponding author), Ericsson Nikola Tesla, Krapinska 45, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",sanjin.gumbarevic@ericsson.com; bojan.milovanovic@grad.unizg.hr; bojana.dalbelo@fer.hr; mergim.gasi@grad.unizg.hr,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2022,15,14,,,,,,,5029,10.3390/en15145029,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15145029,,,,Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000831993600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It requires not only favorable modeling methods, but also attention to the intrinsic cause analysis of loads. However, most previous studies have focused more on the improvement of forecasting algorithms, lacking the comprehensive analysis and scientific research from the load formation mechanism. To address this, a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-driven forecasting method integrating building thermal load characteristics, is proposed. This modeling approach takes into account both strong reflection ability of resistance-capacitance (RC) for the thermo-physical characteristics of building envelope and the superior handling capability of dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) for occupant uncertainties. Therewith, the independent building enve-lope model and occupant behavior model are established. Coupling the predicted values of these two sub-models, the building total load forecasting model is established using fuzzy radial basis function (RBF) neural network. A case study of an office building in Tianjin is utilized to validate the proposed method, revealing excellent predictive performance for both the sub-models and the total load model. The proposed method can effectively predict thermal load both from the for-mation mechanism of internal and external disturbances. It was found that the AI-driven model incorporating building thermal load characteristics, achieves significantly higher precision compared to the general data-driven model, with a reduction of 14.74% in coefficient of variation of root mean squared error in summer and 59.78% in winter.","[Zhao, Jing; Yuan, Xiulian; Duan, Yaoqi; Li, Haonan; Liu, Dehan] Tianjin Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Tianjin Key Lab Built Environm & Energy Applicat, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Tianjin University,"Zhao, J (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Tianjin Key Lab Built Environm & Energy Applicat, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",zhaojing@tju.edu.cn,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,Nov.15,2023,79,,,,,,,,107855,10.1016/j.jobe.2023.107855,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2023.107855,,Oct.23,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:001087052400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper proposes a GIS-based two-step procedure to streamline the process of the management of UAV-collected images for supporting building facade inspection. First, a 2D GIS spatial model of building facades is created by net-unfolding facade surfaces around the building footprint in GIS to store the geometric and geographic information of building facades. Then, the UAV-collected images are automatically geo-registered to the 2D GIS spatial model through computer vision techniques applied in GIS. An experimental case study is also presented to demonstrate the process and evaluate the performance of the proposed method. It is demonstrated that the GIS-based spatial model of net-unfolded building facades allows for an efficient and effective registration of UAV-captured close-range facade images without apparent loss of pixel data.

One area ideally suited to exploit this powerful new technology is building performance simulation. Physics-based models have traditionally been used to estimate the energy flow, air movement, and heat balance of buildings. However, physics-based models require many assumptions, significant computational power, and a considerable amount of time to output predictions. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) with prefabricated or simulated data are likely to be a more feasible option for environmental analysis conducted by designers during the early design phase. Because ANNs require fewer inputs and shorter computation times and offer superior performance and potential for data augmentation, they have received increased attention for predicting the surface solar radiation on buildings. Furthermore, ANNs can provide innovative and quick design solutions, enabling designers to receive instantaneous feedback on the effects of a proposed change to a building's design. This research introduces deep learning methods as a means of simulating the annual radiation intensities and exposure level of buildings without the need for physics-based engines. We propose the CoolVox model to demonstrate the feasibility of using 3D convolutional neural networks to predict the surface radiation on building facades. The CoolVox model accurately predicted the radiation intensities of building facades under different boundary conditions and performed better than ARINet (with average mean square errors of 0.01 and 0.036, respectively) in predicting the radiation intensity both with (validation error = 0.0165) and without (validation error = 0.0066) the presence of boundary buildings.","[Han, Jung Min; Malkawi, Ali] Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Design, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Han, Jung Min; Malkawi, Ali] Harvard Ctr Green Bldg & Cities, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Choi, Eun Seuk] Harvard John A Paulson Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA USA",Harvard University,"Han, JM (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Design, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Han, JM (corresponding author), Harvard Ctr Green Bldg & Cities, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jhan2harvard@gmail.com,,,,,,,,7,9,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2022,15,5,,,,,755,768,,10.1007/s12273-021-0837-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12273-021-0837-0,,Sep.21,,Thermodynamics; Construction & Building Technology,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000697093000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the scalability and implementation of DRL controllers are still limited since they require a considerable amount of time before converging to a near-optimal solution. This issue is currently addressed in literature through the offline pre -training of the DRL agent. However this solution results in two main critical issues: (1) the need to develop a building surrogate model to perform the training task, and (2) the need to perform a fine-tuning process over several training episodes to obtain a near-optimal control policy.In this context, this paper introduces an Online Transfer Learning (OTL) strategy that exploits two knowledge-sharing techniques, weight-initialization and imitation learning, to transfer a DRL control policy from a source office building to various target buildings in a simulation environment coupling EnergyPlus and Python.A DRL controller based on discrete Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) is trained on the source building to manage the operation of a cooling system consisting of a chiller and a thermal storage. Several target buildings are defined to benchmark the performance of the OTL strategy with that of a Rule-Based Controller (RBC) and two DRL-based control strategies, deployed in offline and online fashion. The strategy adopted for OTL emulates the real world implementation with a simulation process by implementing the transferred DRL agent for a single episode in the target buildings. Target buildings have the same geometrical features and are served by the same energy system as the source building, but differ in terms of weather conditions, electricity price schedules, occupancy patterns, and building envelope efficiency levels. The results show that the OTL strategy can reduce the cumulated sum of temperature violations on average by 50% and 80% respectively when compared to RBC and online DRL while enhancing the energy system operation with electricity cost savings ranging between 20% and 40%. The OTL agent performs slightly worse than the offline DRL controller but it does not require any modeling effort and can be implemented directly on target buildings emulating a real-world implementation.","[Coraci, Davide; Brandi, Silvio; Capozzoli, Alfonso] Politecn Torino, Dept Energy, BAEDA Lab, TEBE Res Grp, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Hong, Tianzhen] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Bldg Technol & Urban Syst Div, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Polytechnic University of Turin; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Capozzoli, A (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Dept Energy, BAEDA Lab, TEBE Res Grp, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",alfonso.capozzoli@polito.it,,,,,,,,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,Mar.01,2023,333,,,,,,,,120598,10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.120598,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.120598,,Jan.23,,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000925256500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This constant temperature set point ensures that the heat pump operates in its more efficient heat-pump mode and minimizes the risk of activating the less efficient auxiliary heating element. As an alternative to a constant set-point strategy, this paper proposes a learning agent for a thermostat with a set-back strategy. This set-back strategy relaxes the set-point temperature during convenient moments, e.g., when the occupants are not at home. Finding an optimal set-back strategy requires solving a sequential decision-making process under uncertainty, which presents two challenges. The first challenge is that for most residential buildings, a description of the thermal characteristics of the building is unavailable and challenging to obtain. The second challenge is that the relevant information on the state, i.e., the building envelope, cannot be measured by the learning agent. In order to overcome these two challenges, our paper proposes an auto-encoder coupled with a batch reinforcement learning technique. The proposed approach is validated for two building types with different thermal characteristics for heating in the winter and cooling in the summer. The simulation results indicate that the proposed learning agent can reduce the energy consumption by 4%-9% during 100 winter days and by 9%-11% during 80 summer days compared to the conventional constant set-point strategy.","[Ruelens, Frederik; Iacovella, Sandro; Belmans, Ronnie] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Elect Engn, Fac Engn, Div ELECTA, Kasteelpk Arenberg 10,Box 2445, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Ruelens, Frederik; Iacovella, Sandro; Claessens, Bert J.; Belmans, Ronnie] EnergyVille, B-3600 Genk, Belgium; [Claessens, Bert J.] Flemish Inst Technol Res, Energy Dept VITO, B-2400 Mol, Belgium",KU Leuven; VITO,"Ruelens, F (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Elect Engn, Fac Engn, Div ELECTA, Kasteelpk Arenberg 10,Box 2445, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",frederik.ruelens@esat.kuleuven.be; Sandro.iacovella@esat.kuleuven.be; Bert.claessens@vito.be; ronnie.belmans@esat.kuleuven.be,,,,,,,,41,42,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2015,8,8,,,,,8300,8318,,10.3390/en8088300,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en8088300,,,,Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000360586600042,View Full Record in Web of Science

Self-sufficient high-rise buildings, which integrate (electricity) generation and efficient usage of resources with dense habitation, can be a sustainable solution for future urbanisation. This paper focuses on transforming Europoint Towers in Rotterdam into self-sufficient buildings considering energy consumption and food production (lettuce crops) using artificial intelligence. Design parameters consist of the number of farming floors, shape, and the properties of the proposed facade skin that includes shading devices. Nine thousand samples are collected from various floor levels to predict self-sufficiency criteria using artificial neural networks (ANN). Optimisation problems with 117 decision variables are formulated using 45 ANN models that have very high prediction accuracies. 13 optimisation algorithms are used for an in-detail investigation of self-sufficiency at the building scale, and potential sufficiency at the neighbourhood scale. Results indicate that 100% and 43.7% self-sufficiencies could be reached for lettuce crops and electricity, respectively, for three buildings with 1800 residents. At the neighbourhood scale, lettuce production could be sufficient for 27,000 people with a decrease of self-sufficiency in terms of energy use of up to 11.6%. Consequently, this paper discusses the potentials and the improvements for self-sufficient high-rise buildings.","[Ekici, Berk; Turrin, Michela; Sariyildiz, Ikbal Sevil] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Chair Design Informat, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands; [Turkcan, Okan F.

A reliable and simplified macro approach called Multi Pier (MP) method was employed to analyze single masonry piers with different aspect ratios (h/l). The shear and flexural strength along with the failure mechanism of each pier were obtained versus various levels of axial force during the sensitivity analysis. The results of the analysis were used as an input of a machine learning approach called Back Propagation Multi-Layer Perceptron (BPMLP) to generalize the data. The outcomes of machine learning was utilized to develop simple, but accurate equations as well as a user-friendly application to obtain the shear strength of a masonry pier according to the mechanical and geometrical properties. The BPMLP network is also able to produce and estimate all potential failure modes of a masonry wall. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed equations and developed application was evaluated using a novel macro-element approach. It is concluded that the proposed equations can be used in any macro-elements approach to enhancing efficiency and saving time. The proposed Equivalent Wall (EW) model was able to precisely estimate the response of full-scale facade masonry walls subjected to the in-plane loads. According to this model, each pier and spandrel was substituted by two elastic continuous (2D) macro-elements which connected via two bi-component discrete el-ements. A linear behavior based on masonry modulus of elasticity and bi-linear constitution according to the shear strength was assigned to the axial and shears components of the discrete links, respectively. The proposed EW model was verified using a five-story-seven-bay masonry wall. Satisfactory results were observed in terms of global load-deflection behavior comparing with popular approaches from the literature.","[Li, Hongbo; Li, Jing] Wuchang Univ Technol, Sch Intelligent Construction, Wuhan 430223, Peoples R China; [Li, Hongbo] CCCC Third Harbor Constructions Co Ltd, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Farhangi, Visar] No Arizona Univ, Dept Civil Engn Construction Management & Environm, Flagstaff, AZ USA",Wuchang University of Technology; Northern Arizona University,"Li, HB (corresponding author), Wuchang Univ Technol, Sch Intelligent Construction, Wuhan 430223, Peoples R China.;Li, HB (corresponding author), CCCC Third Harbor Constructions Co Ltd, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.",lhb20211005@126.com; visar.farhangi@nau.edu,,,,,,,,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2023,49,,,,,,443,466,,10.1016/j.istruc.2023.01.095,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.istruc.2023.01.095,,Feb.23,,"Engineering, Civil",,,,,,Y,N,16.01.2024,WOS:000931068200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Commonly, facades are designed to fulfill a multitude of objectives such as superior aesthetic appearance, a higher degree of weathering reliability, quick installation, high transparency as well as economic and ecologic efficiency. For such glazing applications, often an assessment of acoustic properties and especially sound insulation abilities are required. Because of the complexity of such an experimental or computational investigation given the framing systems and glass unit compositions, a reliable and fairly accurate estimation of sound insulation properties of such systems becomes time-consuming and demanding. This paper provides a Machine Learning (ML) based estimation tool of acoustic properties (weighted sound insulation value RW, STC and OITC) of different glazing set-ups. A sufficiently rich database was used to train several machine learning algorithms. The acoustic properties are determined by comparing the third-octave or octave band spectrum of the sound reduction index with a reference curve (typical curve for solid construction elements) specified in the standard DIN EN ISO 717-1. Sound insulation values can currently only be determined by complex and expensive experimental investigations or numerical simulations for certain glass set-ups. Hence, there is no efficient tool for convenient and reliable estimation of the sound insulation performance of glazing systems available at the moment. To this end, the engineering team led by the authors conducted extensive studies on various glazings consisting of different glass assemblies with varying glass, cavity and interlayer thicknesses and different types of interlayer and gas fillings. Based on our research outcomes, a comprehensive web-based prediction program, the so-called AI Tool, has been developed recently. This program can provide a quick analysis and accurate prediction of arbitrary glazing set-ups, interlayers and glazing infills. A series of laboratory tests were conducted to validate the predictions by the AI Tool. The goal of this program is to provide designers, engineers, and architects an effective and economically efficient tool to facilitate the design w.r.t. acoustical properties.","[Drass, Michael; Kraus, Michael Anton; Riedel, Henrik] M&M Network Ing UG Haftungsbeschrankt, Lennebergstr 40, D-55124 Mainz, Germany; [Stelzer, Ingo] Kuraray Europe GmbH, Philipp Reis Str 4, D-65795 Hattersheim, Germany",,"Drass, M (corresponding author), M&M Network Ing UG Haftungsbeschrankt, Lennebergstr 40, D-55124 Mainz, Germany.",drass@mm-network-ing.com; kraus@mm-network-ing.com; Ingo.Stelzer@kuraray.com,,,,,,,,2,4,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2022,7,1,,,,,101,118,,10.1007/s40940-022-00167-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40940-022-00167-z,,Feb.22,,Construction & Building Technology,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000749448300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The increase of the proportion of glazed building facades is an incomplete solution raising other problems regarding thermal and visual comfort, while rebound effects in terms of lighting usage lowered the energetic benefits of LED technology. Another strategy to address the issue of energy is the well-known strategy of the re-introduction of task lights. The current study presents a system arbitrating the contribution of daylight with general and task electric lighting from the prediction of key performance indicators (work plane illuminance and daylight glare probability) by a machine learning model. It aims at reducing energy consumption while minimizing the impact on occupants' comfort and productivity. This system was validated by the mean of a controlled user experiment with 60 participants. Altogether, our data revealed that RADIANCE simulations model accurately predicts on-site monitoring (R2 = .96) and that the machine learning model accurately predicts RADIANCE simulations for both work plane illuminance (R2 = .99) and daylight glare probability (R2 = .99) allowing to operate the automated system. Data from the user experiment shows that our system successfully saves 35 Wh on average compared to manual operation of the room by users, by making prior use of daylight and task lighting. This represents more than halving the energy demand. Importantly, the automation impacted neither users' comfort or task performance. System acceptance constructs such as system reliability or trust in the system were found to be linked with an attribution of the locus of control to powerful others. This result suggests that the key towards high user acceptance might lie in purposefully addressing this dimension. Altogether, the presented results support the potential for energy saving through the development of user-centred lighting automation.","[Papinutto, Michael; Colombo, Moreno; Lalanne, Denis; Nembrini, Julien] Univ Fribourg, Human IST Res Inst, Bd Perolles 90, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Papinutto, Michael] Univ Fribourg, Dept Psychol, Visual & Social Neurosci Unit, Rue P-A Faucigny 2, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland; [Boghetti, Roberto; Basurto, Chantal; Kampf, Jerome H.] Idiap Res Inst, Energy Informat Grp, Rue Marconi 19, CH-1920 Valais, Switzerland; [Reutter, Kornelius] Regent Beleuchtungskorper AG, Dornacherstr 390, CH-4018 Basel, Switzerland",University of Fribourg; University of Fribourg,"Nembrini, J (corresponding author), Univ Fribourg, Human IST Res Inst, Bd Perolles 90, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.",julien.nembrini@unifr.ch,,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,Aug.01,2022,268,,,,,,,,112176,10.1016/j.enbuild.2022.112176,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2022.112176,,May.22,,"Construction & Building Technology; Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000812321200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most studies have adopted design variation parameters as the input parameters for model training, but this method greatly limits the scope of application of the daylight model. By extending application to different design possibilities, this research proposes a novel daylight model, which includes a pre-processing procedure to convert the design model into Intermediary features as input parameters representing daylight penetration performance. By changing geometry of one kind of parametric facade and performing daylighting simulation, we were able to generate the data for training, including Intermediary features and sDA/ASE values. The daylight model was then trained using an artificial neural network. Finally, the proposed daylight model was tested by predicting the daylight performance of other kinds of facades. The results indicated that the value of DA and ASE hours per grid were well predicted and that the daylight distribution was reproduced even with different kinds of facades.

The reproducibility, the predictive capability, and most importantly the extension of model applicability were all demonstrated for the proposed model. Furthermore, comparing to the daylighting simulation, the method using the proposed daylight model is estimated to save 9/10 daylighting evaluation time.

The building shape coefficient, sun-shading strategies, window wall ratio, roof, and walls were studied through a method involving multilayer feed-forward neural network model simulations. Results show that the optimum shape coefficient value is 0.32. The combination of interior and exterior blinds and electrochromic glass is the ideal option to reduce the increase in the energy consumption of the architecture caused by solar radiation. Maintaining the window wall ratio at 0.4 is ideal. A green roof exerts a minimal effect on building energy consumption decrease (only 0.4%). Applying the strategy of vertical greening to the external wall can reduce cooling energy consumption by as much as 5.4%. Adopting the best envelope strategy combination can further decrease energy consumption by 20.8%. This strategy is also applicable to the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River in China, which flow through Nanchang and have a climate similar to that of the said area.

The existing methods are difficult to extract the identical features for the registration of Array InSAR point clouds. To this end, a robust registration approach Array InSAR point clouds in urban areas is proposed in this study. The main contribution of this article is raising the theoretically optimal transformation for achieving point cloud registration, considering the constraint from parallel facades of a certain building.

However, these systems might be expensive and require appropriate control strategies in order to improve the performance of the building. In this paper a ventilated facade with PCM is controlled using a reinforcement learning algorithm. The ventilated facade uses mechanical ventilation during nighttime to solidify the PCM and releases this cold stored to the inner environment during the peak demand period. It is crucial to decide correctly the schedule of charge and discharge process of the PCM according to the weather and indoor conditions.

In this paper, the power forecasting for BIPV systems in a vertical facade is studied using machine learning algorithms based on decision trees. The forecasting scheme employs the skforecast library from the Python environment, which facilitates the implementation of different schemes for both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting applications. Firstly, deterministic forecasting of hourly BIPV power was performed with XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms for different cases, showing an improvement in forecasting accuracy when some exogenous variables were used. Secondly, probabilistic forecasting was performed with XGBoost combined with the Bootstrap method.

In contrast to such facade solutions, responsive facade systems with embedded sensing, actuation, and control systems have been proven to perform with up to 65% higher efficiency by being able to adapt their physical characters, such as orientation, and material property in real-time as a response to fluctuating environmental conditions (visual and thermal) and user preferences. Advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning processes further aid such responsive facade systems to optimize multiple parameters such as illuminance level and the associated lighting energy, visual discomfort caused by solar glare, solar heat gain, thermal resistance (heating energy and comfort level), and natural ventilation simultaneously. This research investigates the case of a real-time adaptive Building Integrated Photo Voltaic (BIPV) shading system and its ability (in comparison with traditional static building integrated photo voltaic facade systems) to perform as regards visual comfort and energy generation potential simultaneously within the humid subtropical climate of Sydney, Australia. A simulated case scenario wherein a real-time adaptive building integrated photo voltaic shading systems is deployed on a typical multistorey building facade in Sydney, Australia is accordingly presented. The conducted simulation considers the responsive building integrated photo voltaic system as a double-skin facade system and uses multi-objective evolutionary computing principles to decipher its integrability potential. A comparative analysis between traditional static mounted Photo Voltaic (PV) systems as opposed to multi-objective optimization driven real-time adaptive building integrated photo voltaic shading configurations is subsequently presented. The ability to maximize generated energy, while simultaneously maintaining visual comfort is thus a unique proposition of this research.","[Biloria, Nimish; Makki, Mohammed; Abdollahzadeh, Nastaran] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Design Architecture & Bldg, Sch Architecture, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Biloria, Nimish] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Technology Sydney; University of Johannesburg,"Biloria, N (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Design Architecture & Bldg, Sch Architecture, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Biloria, N (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Johannesburg, South Africa.",nimish.biloria@uts.edu.au,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,Mar.02,2023,9,,,,,,,,1119696,10.3389/fbuil.2023.1119696,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fbuil.2023.1119696,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000952611000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The simulation model simulates the building's energy performance, considering different values for various envelope parameters. The predictive model employs machine learning algorithms, including RF, ANN, DNN, SVM, GENLIN, and GB (in which GB has been identified as the most suitable algorithm), boasting a very high R2(0.994) to assess energy consumption.

Although the literature in this field has focused on investigating critical factors in energy consumption, only a few studies have conducted a quantitative sensitivity analysis for thermal occupant factors (TOF) (i.e., metabolic rate and clothing level). Therefore, this paper introduces a framework for testing the criticality of TOF with a cross-comparison against building-related factors, considering the constraint of occupant thermal comfort. Using a building energy simulation model, the energy consumption of a case study is simulated, and building energy model alternatives are generated. The scope includes TOF and building envelope factors, with an established orthogonal experimental design. A popular branch of machine learning (ML) called linear genetic programming (LGP) is used to analyse the generated data from the experiment. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted using the developed LGP model to determine and rank the criticality of the considered factors. The findings reveal that occupants' metabolic rate and clothing level have relevancy factors of -0.48 and -0.38 respectively, which ranked them 2nd and 3rd against building envelope factors for achieving energy-efficient comfortable houses.

Building energy modeling is a reliable technique that provides a pathway to analyze and optimize various energy-efficient building envelope measures.

Therefore, this paper proposed a novel optimization algorithm, MEVO (metamodel-based evolutionary optimizer), developed to efficiently identify optimal retrofit solutions for building envelopes while minimizing the need for extensive simulations. The key innovation of MEVO lies in its integration of evolutionary techniques with design-of-computer experiments, machine learning, and metaheuristic optimization. This approach continuously refined a machine learning model through metaheuristic optimization, crossover, and mutation operations. Comparative assessments were conducted against four alternative metaheuristic algorithms and Bayesian optimization, demonstrating MEVO's effectiveness in reliably finding the best solution within a reduced computation time. A hypothesis test revealed that the proposed algorithm is significantly better than Bayesian optimization in finding the best cost values. Regarding computation time, the proposed algorithm is 4-7 times faster than the particle swarm optimization algorithm and has a similar computational speed as Bayesian Optimization.","[Batres, Rafael] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Engn & Sci, Santiago De Queretaro 76140, Queretaro, Mexico; [Dadras, Yasaman; Mostafazadeh, Farzad; Kavgic, Miroslava] Univ Ottawa, Dept Civil Engn, 161 Louis Pasteur Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",Tecnologico de Monterrey; University of Ottawa,"Kavgic, M (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Civil Engn, 161 Louis Pasteur Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",rafael.batres@tec.mx; ydadr066@uottawa.ca; farzad.mostafazadeh@uottawa.ca; mkavgic@uottawa.ca,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2023,16,20,,,,,,,7026,10.3390/en16207026,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16207026,,,,Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:001093583300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two artificial intelligence models, such as multiple linear regression and artificial neural networks, have been used to predict. The wall temperature has been predicted mainly based on the parameters like ambient temperature, wind speed and relative humidity in all four directions of the buildings. Three statistical analyses were used to validate the model's outcome: R-Squared, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). In terms of train and control data, the two models yield comparable findings. The artificial neural network model has more adaptability since it was able to adjust to unexpected changes in the input data, according to a comparison of the applied mathematics of each model. The regression model was used for this investigation because it gives constant estimate values for the factors, though the neural model isn't numerically characterized.

In this article multi-objective optimisations of building envelope were carried out by coupling TRNSYS (Transient System Simulation Tool) and jEPlus + EA (EnergyPlus simulation manager for parametrics + Evolutionary Algorithms). The objective functions to be minimised were thermal discomfort hours (TDH), daylight unsatisfied hours (DUH) and life cycle costs (LCC) while maintaining acceptable sound transmission levels and indoor air quality. The decision variables were envelope components of a prefabricated house. Applications for six different climate zones corresponding to eight locations in Australia were investigated. The optimal solution sets were unique for each climate zone. The optimal solutions achieved 27-31% savings in LCC compared to the baseline. The reductions for TDH varied from 6% to 55% among the locations.

The methodology is construed over four successive phases, namely: the built environment modeling, analyses for a solid understanding of the study area, determination of the generative design criteria, and finally design solutions. In the initial phase, the case-study building in Basmane with the surrounding environment was digitally modeled for the following analyses. Several programs apart from BIM have been utilized for the daylight zones and wind simulations. The daylight areas affecting the surface of the studied building were marked schematically per the simulation data. Subsequently, the area of the curtain wall, material type, preliminary building unit cost (assembly/labor and material cost), the height of storey, the density of elements, and fixed shading devices parameters were tested via optimization thru generative design methodology and provide potential design solutions by utilization of BIM tools. The findings of this study could be boiled down to a single comprehensive objective of generating outputs of assorted design solutions thru a generative design approach. When the output data set is visualized via parallel coordinate graphs, it could be well articulated that the classification of rule-based relationships and the criteria interrelations were based on the designer's decisions. Research Limitations/Implications This study was examined on a case basis by an experimental approach. It shall be considered that the curtain wall construction encompasses diverse materials, connection details, and construction techniques that affect the final cost thus this research was conducted at the preliminary design stage and might not reflect actual costs. Social/Practical Implications Albeit the technical aspect of the curtain walls is not included in this case study, it helps generative design culture by demonstrating the extent of the opportunities it offers to designers in the preliminary design stage. This study is a show-case of a preliminary design for an actual building stock in the vicinity of Basmane focusing on the building envelope design process with multiple parameters and should be regarded as an opportunity to understand how innovative solutions alike are put forward for the use of designers.","[Yonder, Veli Mustafa] Izmir Inst Technol, Fac Architecture, Izmir, Turkey",Izmir Institute of Technology,"Yönder, VM (corresponding author), Izmir Inst Technol, Fac Architecture, Izmir, Turkey.",velimustafayonder@gmail.com,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2020,8,,,,SI,,1,17,,10.15320/ICONARP.2020.140,http://dx.doi.org/10.15320/ICONARP.2020.140,,,,Architecture,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000604347700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These envelopes interact with multiple interconnected domains, such as daylight, indoor air quality, thermal comfort, and energy use, which can often conflict with one another. Identifying and developing suitable control strategies that can optimally manage the envelope's impact on many domains and avoid sub-optimal operations is an open challenge. Conventional approaches commonly adopted in buildings and building envelope control based on schedules or relatively simple decision trees may be unable to tackle the dynamic behaviour of adaptive envelopes. Due to their complexity, more advanced control approaches based on simulation-informed decision-making are scarce in both research and practice. In this work, we propose a multi-domain model-based control (MBC) algorithm for an adaptive facade concept based on a flexible Double Skin Facade (DSF). The proposed method, which aims for a balanced performance over different comfort domains and energy use, employs a co-simulation approach where the DSF is modelled in a Building Energy Simulation (BES) tool and the control algorithm to manage the simulation and optimize the control of the facade is developed in a generic programming language. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to design and demonstrate the effectiveness of a simulation-informed control strategy that can handle and optimise the behaviour of a complex facade by considering multiple performance objectives. The innovation of this approach lies in the MBC algorithm that selects the optimal facade state among over seventy possible states at each timestep, the practical demonstration of the feasibility in a BES tool, and the complexity of the controlled facade system. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed control approach, we compared the innovative MBC to more traditional control strategies, such as schedule and rule-based controls, revealing how it enabled the facade to achieve a better performance in all the analysed domains. By applying the MBC to three different year periods, we showed that the energy and environmental performance was within the selected comfort criteria for all the domains for>80% of the occupied hours, and an energy reduction of up to 70% was simultaneously obtained if compared to more traditional approaches. The control approach presented in this study and the simulation method employed can be used not only to improve the performance of advanced adaptive facades by providing an effective solution to the challenge of balancing multiple conflicting performance domains but also for more conventional building envelope systems that exhibit a certain degree of dynamic behaviour.","[Lucchino, Elena Catto; Goia, Francesco] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture & Technol, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Goia, F (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture & Technol, NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.",francesco.goia@ntnu.no,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,Apr.15,2023,285,,,,,,,,112881,10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.112881,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.112881,,Feb.23,,"Construction & Building Technology; Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000953088200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This requires accurately estimating spatio-temporal solar photovoltaic (PV) potential on urban surfaces. However, it is still a challenge to obtain a fast and accurate estimation of rooftop solar PV potential over large urban built-up areas. Thus, this study proposes a parametric-based method to estimate annual rooftop solar irradiation at a fine spatial resolution. Specifically, seven parameters (Digital Surface Model, Sky View Factor, shadow from buildings, shadow from terrain, building volume to facade ratio, slope, and aspect) are determined that having great importance in modeling rooftop solar irradiation. Three machine learning methods (Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boost Regression Tree (GBRT), and AdaBoost) trained by the selected parameters are cross-compared based on R2, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and computation time. As a case study in Hong Kong, China, the RF outperformed GBRT and AdaBoost, with R2 = 0.77 and MAE = 22.83 kWh/m2/year. The time for training and prediction of rooftop solar irradiation is within 13 h, achieving a 99.32% reduction in time compared to the physical-based hemispherical viewshed algorithm.

A plugin is developed to receive sensor data and export all necessary information from BIM to MSSQL and Excel. The BIM model was imported to IDA Indoor Climate and Energy (IDA ICE) to execute an energy con-sumption simulation and then a pairwise test to produce the sample data set. To study the data set and develop a prediction model between building factors and energy usage, 11 machine learning algorithms are used. The best algorithm was Group Least Square Support Vector Machine (GLSSVM), later employed in NSGA II as the building energy consumption fitness function using Dynamo software. An NSGA II multi-objective optimization model is designed to reduce building energy consumption and optimize interior thermal comfort (measured by the predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD)).

Conventionally, the facade panel picking position is done manually by trial and error. The designer chooses a place to pick up a facade piece within reach of the robot arm, and then simulates the entire pick and place process in a digital model before applying to the assembly on the construction job site. After that the designer might detect errors, collisions, or singularities, which require the designer to modify the position of picking by changing the location or orientation of the module, thus repeating the simulation cycle until they reach a satisfactory result with no errors or collisions. This work is usually considered monotonous, inefficient, and time consuming. Therefore, this research proposes an optimization process implemented in design stage of construction project via static performance criteria in order to automatically search for the best picking location within the reach of the robot arm. The goal is to automate the process of robot location finding and solve the limitations of modular robot assembly simulation processes in order to allow for effective execution during the robotic construction implementation. The proposed approach, called iFobot, consists of three modules: Facade Generative Modeling (iFobot-D), Robot Position Optimization (iFobot-B), and Culminating Feedback to BIM (iFobot-L). Specifically, the scope of the paper is limited to the robot arm and facade picking and placing location finding processes. This research al lows initial assessment of the possible assembly process as regards the dimensions of modules and hence the overall dimensions of the system, which subsequently influences assembly implementation in the construction job site. A set of generative algorithms were developed using commercially developed visual programming language that automatically populate facade modules on the building envelope, find the robot and facade assembly locations with their quantity take-off, and integrate the module with the BIM environment. A case study has been developed to validate and test the proposed system. The results prove that the system generates optimized locations for the robot arm workstations with the lowest possible collision and reachability rate while addressing robot operation time reduction, thus reducing risks encountered during facade assembly and increasing productivity. Moreover, the iFobot is predicted to influence decision making during the facade assembly process on a physical construction job site.","[Ali, Ahmed Khairadeen; Song, Hayub] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Architecture & Bldg Sci, Seoul 06974, South Korea; [Lee, One Jae] Haenglim Architecture & Engn Co, 201 Songpa daero, Seoul 05854, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Song, H (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Sch Architecture & Bldg Sci, Seoul 06974, South Korea.",ahmedshingaly@gmail.com; o.lee@haenglim.com; hysong@cau.ac.kr,,,,,,,,19,19,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2021,33,,,,,,,,101556,10.1016/j.jobe.2020.101556,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2020.101556,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000599645900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this work, a multi-objective optimization approach, based on a smart surrogate model, has been developed to minimize the energy consumption, improve the thermal comfort of the occupants and increase the energy self-sufficiency of residential buildings. For this purpose, two main phases have been considered: the first one is related to the development of the surrogate model, based on machine learning utilities, in particular Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and the second is related to the optimization process, performed by means of the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (MOPSO). This approach has been applied to a typical Moroccan building, Ground Floor thorn First Floor (GFFF), in different regulatory climate zones. The results show that the approach was successfully implemented using TRNSYS, Matlab and other numerical simulation tools, leading to different solutions in terms of building envelope design. The best-fit solution achieved a huge improvement potential in most climate zones, averaging about 75%, 50% and 85% respectively for energy consumption, thermal comfort and energy self-sufficiency of the studied building.

Such is the case of the study of air change rates (ACHs) in buildings for their complex mechanisms and high variability.

The incorporation of airtightness limits to quantify adequate ACHs in national transpositions of the Energy Performance Building Directive (EPBD) exemplifies the issue. This research presents a roadmap for developing an alternative instrument, a compliance tool built with a Machine Learning (ML) framework, that overcomes some simplification issues regarding policy implementation while fulfilling practitioners' needs and general societal use. It relies on dwellings' terrain, geometric and airtightness characteristics, and meteorological data. Results from previous work on a region with a mild heating season in southern Europe apply in training and testing the proposed tool. The tool outputs numerical information on the air change rates performance of the building envelope, and a label, accordingly. On the test set, the best regressor showed mean absolute errors (MAE) below 1.02% for all the response variables, while the best classifier presented an average accuracy of 97.32%.

Little research on this topic focused on the collection of damage data, the understanding of damage mechanisms and the deepening of data analysis methods. In this paper, the relative contribution of different failure mechanisms to the occurrence of rainstorm damage is investigated, as well as the extent to which these mechanisms relate to weather variables. For a case study in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, a property level home insurance database of around 3100 water-related damage claims was analysed. The records include comprehensive transcripts of communication between insurer, insured and damage assessment experts, which allowed claims to be classified according to their actual damage cause. The results show that roof and wall leakage is the most frequent failure mechanism causing precipitation-related claims, followed by blocked roof gutters, melting snow and sewer flooding. Claims related to sewer flooding were less present in the data, but are associated with significantly larger claim sizes than claims in the majority class, i. e. roof and wall leakages. Rare events logistic regression analysis revealed that maximum rainfall intensity and rainfall volume are significant predictors for the occurrence probability of precipitation-related claims. Moreover, it was found that claims associated with rainfall intensities smaller than 7-8mm in a 60-min window are mainly related to failure processes in the private domain, such as roof and wall leakages. For rainfall events that exceed the 7-8mmh(-1) threshold, the failure of systems in the public domain, such as sewer systems, start to contribute considerably to the overall occurrence probability of claims. The communication transcripts, however, lacked information to be conclusive about to which extent sewer-related claims were caused by overloading of sewer systems or failure of system components.","[Spekkers, M.

We propose a novel approach for the automatic learning of weighted attributed context-free grammar rules for 3D building reconstruction, supporting the laborious manual design of rules. We separate structure from parameter learning. Specific Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used to generate a weighted context-free grammar and predict structured outputs such as parse trees. The grammar is extended by parameters and constraints, which are learned based on a statistical relational learning method using Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). MLNs enforce the topological and geometric constraints. MLNs address uncertainty explicitly and provide probabilistic inference. They are able to deal with partial observations caused by occlusions. Uncertain projective geometry is used to deal with the uncertainty of the observations. Learning is based on a large building database covering different building styles and facade structures.

We automatically generate a small number of most likely hypotheses and provide probabilities for each of them. Probability density functions of model parameters which in most cases are non Gaussian and multimodal are learned from training data and approximated by Gaussian mixtures. Relations between model parameters are represented by non-linear constraints. For stochastic reasoning we design and apply a special kind of Bayesian networks which involves both discrete as well as continuous variables, a scenario which often suggests the use of approximate inference which however is infeasible in the face of a huge number of competing model hypotheses. In order to be able to scan huge model spaces avoiding the pitfalls of approximate reasoning and to exploit the potential of both observations and models, we combined Bayesian networks with constraint logic programs. We designed a method which breaks down the problem into a feasible number of subproblems for which exact inference can be applied. We illustrate our approach with building facades and demonstrate that particularly for buildings with strong symmetries number and position of windows can be deduced on the basis of ground plans alone.","[Loch-Dehbi, Sandra; Pluemer, Lutz] Univ Bonn, Inst Geodesy & Geoinformat, Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Loch-Dehbi, S (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Inst Geodesy & Geoinformat, Bonn, Germany.",loch-dehbi@igg.uni-bonn.de; pluemer@igg.uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2015,54,,,,,,68,81,,10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2015.05.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2015.05.004,,,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Studies; Geography; Operations Research & Management Science; Regional & Urban Planning",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000368306700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the particular cases of building-integrated and building-attached photovoltaic systems (BIPV and BAPV, respectively) the time-varying partial shading conditions are a relevant added difficulty for modeling the PV power conversion. The availability of laser imaging detection and ranging (LIDAR) data to create very-high-resolution elevation digital models can be effectively used for computing the shading at high resolution. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) has been used to model the power generation of different BIPV arrays on a 5 min basis using the meteorological and solar irradiance on-site conditions, as well as the shading patterns estimated from a digital surface model as inputs. The ANN model has been validated using three years of 5-min-basis monitored data showing very high accuracy (6-16% of relative error depending on the facade). The proposed methodology combines the shading computation from a digital surface model with powerful machine learning algorithms for modeling vertical PV arrays under partial shading conditions. The results presented here prove also the capability of the machine learning techniques towards the creation of a digital twin for the specific case of BIPV systems that complements the conventional monitoring strategies and can be used in the diagnosis of performance anomalies.","[Polo, Jesus; Martin-Chivelet, Nuria; Sanz-Saiz, Carlos] CIEMAT, Renewable Energy Div, Photovolta Solar Energy Unit, Avda Complutense 40, Madrid 28040, Spain","Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas, Medioambientales Tecnologicas","Polo, J (corresponding author), CIEMAT, Renewable Energy Div, Photovolta Solar Energy Unit, Avda Complutense 40, Madrid 28040, Spain.",jesus.polo@ciemat.es; nuria.martin@ciemat.es; carlos.sanz@ciemat.es,,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2022,15,11,,,,,,,4173,10.3390/en15114173,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15114173,,,,Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000808898300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Clear differences were noticed in relation to features, such as the repeatability of compositional elements and the method of building a vertical compositional axis. Variations were observed in the frequency and extent of application of specific types of compositions.

Psychological comfort can cause dissatisfaction with their work. Thus, it is important to understand what factors contribute to employees' satisfaction in workplaces. The purpose of this paper is to identify the weight of contribution of each design parameter on increasing psychological satisfaction. The study included 579 employees in five offices in The Netherlands through an online survey. The typologies of offices vary in terms of office layouts, orientations and facade. Additionally, a parameter of desk location was included as this factor may be associated with user satisfaction. Kruskal-Wallis H test, categorical regression, and logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the impact of these design parameters on psychological user satisfaction. The results revealed the impact of design parameters on the psychological satisfaction. The parameters of office layouts and desk locations were the significant predictor factors for the probability of satisfaction variables (e.g. privacy, concentration, communication, social contact and territoriality). The parameters for optimal satisfaction were found in cellular office, north-west oriented workstation and 4 m away from a window. Psychological comfort is an inevitable aspect in user satisfaction studies. This paper, therefore, measures and predicts the relationship between design factors and employees' satisfaction through case studies in The Netherlands. The findings help designers, architects, planners and facility managers to develop user-focussed office design principles supporting employees' work performance.","[Kwon, Minyoung] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Climate Design & Sustainabil, Delft, Netherlands; [Remoy, Hilde] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Management Built Environm, Delft, Netherlands; [Remoy, Hilde] Univ Pavia, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Pavia, Italy",Delft University of Technology; Delft University of Technology; University of Pavia,"Kwon, M (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Dept Climate Design & Sustainabil, Delft, Netherlands.",kwminyoung@gmail.com; h.t.remoy@tudelft.nl,,,,,,,,17,18,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,38,01.Feb,,,,,1,19,,10.1108/F-03-2019-0041,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/F-03-2019-0041,,,,Management,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000507568400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the blast loads that apply to structures located in denser environments are significantly affected by the complex interactions of the blast wave with the urban topography. Many existing works address the effects resulting from such interactions; however, their scopes are mostly limited to considering a few buildings or streets, while the influence of building porosity on the shielding effect has received limited attention. This work utilizes validated high-fidelity numerical simulations to carry out a detailed investigation of the influence of a building's porosity (categorized as zero, low, mediumand high) on its capacity to shield virtual facades located at several distances behind the shielding structure. The results show that the shielding effect is mainly bounded below by that behind the high-porosity building and above by that behind the zero or low-porosity building, depending on the standoff distance to the charge. Finally, suitable scaling and modeling approaches including regression and machine learning techniques are applied to devise simplified, yet more general data -driven surrogate tools for computationally inexpensive predictions. These can contribute in helping design engineers evaluate blast loads behind porous structures following explosions in cityscapes.","[Dib, Nancy; Zehil, Gerard-Philippe] Notre Dame Univ Louaize, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Zouk Mosbeh, Lebanon; [Rigby, Samuel] Univ Sheffield, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, Mappin St, Sheffield S1 3JD, England",Notre Dame University Lebanon; University of Sheffield,"Zéhil, GP (corresponding author), Notre Dame Univ Louaize, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Zouk Mosbeh, Lebanon.",gpzehil@ndu.edu.lb,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2022,115,,,,,,,,103787,10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2022.103787,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfluidstructs.2022.103787,,Nov.22,,"Engineering, Mechanical; Mechanics",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000917277300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, roadmap for PCMs' application in carbon -neutral transition is ambiguous in the current academia, and a state-of-the-art overview on latent thermal storage is necessary. In this study, a comprehensive review was conducted on cutting-edge technologies for carbon -neutral transition with latent thermal storages. Both carbon-positive and carbon-negative strategies in the operational stage are reviewed. Carbon-positive solution mainly focuses on energy-efficient buildings, through a series of passive, active, and smart control strategies with artificial intelligence. Passive strategies, to enhance thermal inertia and thermal storage of building envelopes, mainly include free cooling, solar chimney, solar facade, and Trombe walls. Active strategies mainly include mechanical ventilations, active water pipe-embedded radiative cooling, and geothermal system integration. The ultimate target is to minimise building energy de-mands, with improved utilisation efficiency on natural heating (e.g., concentrated solar thermal energy, geothermal heating, and solar-driven ventilative heating) and cooling resources (e.g., ventilative cooling, geothermal cooling, and sky radiative cooling). As one of the most critical solutions to offset the released carbon emission, carbon-negative strategies with PCMs mainly include cleaner power production and waste heat re-covery. Main functions of PCMs include energy efficiency enhancement on cleaner power production, steady steam production, steady heat flux via the latent storage capacity, and pre-heat purpose on waste heat recovery. A thermal energy interaction network with transportation is formulated with PCMs' recovering heat from in-ternal combustion engines and spatiotemporal energy sharing, to provide frontier research guidelines. Future studies are recommended to spotlight standard testing procedure and database, benchmarks for suitable PCMs selection, seasonal cascaded energy storage, nanofluid-based heat transfer enhancement in PCMs, anti-corrosion, compatibility, thermochemical stability, and economic feasibility of PCMs. This study provides a clear roadmap on developing PCMs for transition towards a carbon-neutral district energy community, together with applica-tions, prospects, and challenges, paving the path for combined efforts from chemical materials synthesis and applications.","[Zhou, Yuekuan] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol Guangzhou, Sustainable Energy & Environm Thrust, Funct Hub, Guangzhou 511400, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yuekuan] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yuekuan] HKUST Shenzhen Hong Kong Collaborat Innovat Res In, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yuekuan] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Emerging Interdisciplinary Areas, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhengxuan] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (Guangzhou); Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Delft University of Technology,"Zhou, YK (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol Guangzhou, Sustainable Energy & Environm Thrust, Funct Hub, Guangzhou 511400, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Zhou, YK (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Zhou, YK (corresponding author), HKUST Shenzhen Hong Kong Collaborat Innovat Res In, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.;Zhou, YK (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Emerging Interdisciplinary Areas, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Liu, ZX (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.",yuekuanzhou@ust.hk; Z.liu-12@tudelft.nl,,,,,,,,10,10,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2023,89,,,,,,,,104378,10.1016/j.scs.2022.104378,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2022.104378,,Dec.22,,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000918635400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hygmthermal simulations were performed for a wood-frame wall with brick cladding using hourly historical and projected future climate data for cities located in different climate zones across Canada. The mould index calculated at the exterior layer of OSB was used as the response variable in the PLS model and the most relevant climate parameters were used as inputs including: temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind-driven rain, and solar radiation normal to the facade. The model was trained using a training set comprising two climate periods and different wall orientations for three cities. It was then used to predict the mould index for other years and wall orientations without performing the simulations. The coefficient of determination (R-2), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was used to evaluate the model's accuracy. Also, ranking and mould risk category analysis were carried out to assess the model's ability to rank the years according to their moisture severity.

Facade elements of the buildings with an architectural design in this study are independent of sustainability-related concerns, suggesting a great issue for the new buildings to be constructed in the traditional pattern. Accordingly, using the genetic algorithm method, proposals were presented for the new door and window typologies with genetic fitness for the architectural designing process of the buildings to be constructed in Surici Region, Diyarbakir, Turkey. Shape grammar, fractal and genetic algorithm, three generative designing systems, were used as the methods. Utilizing the genetic algorithm method, a field study was performed for the proposal of new door and window typologies with the fitness value. The field study was assessed through the plans and facade analyses regarding six Diyarbakir traditional houses with U plan type in Surici region of Diyarbakir. An identity card was created for the plan and facade data of the buildings and transferred to the table. Then, the door and window typologies of the exterior facade elements of each examined building were crossed within themselves with the GA method. As a result of the crossover, alternative joinery typologies with a total of 31 windows and 53 different door typologies with compatibility values were produced. Thus, the sustainability of the data of traditional joinery typologies for use in contemporary houses has been ensured. In conclusion, optimal alternative typologies were presented in regard to every chopping typology assessed with the genetic algorithm method. It is thought that this study should be a method that can be used in the production of exterior joinery typologies of contemporary houses to be built in many different cities of our country, especially in the historical texture. Thus, by using the GA method for the production of exterior joinery typologies of contemporary houses to be built in the region, different designers will be able to obtain various designs compatible with the traditional architectural texture while preserving their originality.","[Salik, Mizgin Gokce] Dicle Univ, Inst Sci & Technol, Diyarbakir, Turkiye; [Aykal, F.

To enhance the energy efficiency of buildings, this paper proposes an approach to predict building energy consumption based on the design of the building envelope. The design parameters of the building envelope include the comprehensive heat transfer coefficient and solar radiation absorption coefficient of exterior walls, comprehensive heat transfer coefficient and solar radiation absorption coefficient of the roof, comprehensive heat transfer coefficient of outer windows, and window-wall ratio. The approach is applied to optimize the design parameters of the building envelope structure of a university teaching building in northern China. First, a building information model of a teaching building is established in Revit and imported into DesignBuilder energy consumption analysis software. Subsequently, a data set of the abovementioned 6 parameters is obtained by performing orthogonal testing and energy consumption simulations. On this basis, an RF model is used to predict building energy consumption and rank the importance of each parameter, and the Pearson function is used to evaluate the corresponding correlations. The results show that the most important parameters with the highest correlations to building energy consumption are the comprehensive heat transfer coefficients of the exterior walls and outer windows and the window-wall ratio.

This paper presents methods for robust mould reliability analysis and identification of critical parameters. Mould indices are calculated by probabilistic hygrothermal analysis, followed by the application of the Finnish mould growth model. To increase the robustness of the mould growth analysis, a random forests metamodel is first trained on the dataset and then used to expand the number of simulations. Finally, the reliability is calculated based on the probability of exceeding a given maximum mould index limit state. Critical parameters are identified through a sensitivity analysis based on linear and non-linear dependencies between inputs and maximum mould index. The methods are demonstrated by analysing three external wall assemblies. In conclusion, the mould reliability analysis method helps to assess the robustness of the hygrothermal analysis and mould assessment by investigating the influence of hygrothermal variables' uncertainties on the maximum mould index. By combining a metamodel with probabilistic analysis, it is possible to significantly reduce the amount of time required to evaluate a large number of scenarios.","[Pour, Mohsen Bayat; Niklewski, Jonas; Hansson, Eva Fruhwald] Lund Univ, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, Div Struct Engn, John Ericssons vag 1, SE-22363 Lund, Sweden; [Naghibi, Amir] Lund Univ, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, Div Water Resources Engn, John Ericssons Vag 1, SE-22363 Lund, Sweden",Ericsson; Lund University; Lund University; Ericsson,"Pour, MB (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, Div Struct Engn, John Ericssons vag 1, SE-22363 Lund, Sweden.",mohsen.bayat_pour@kstr.lth.se; jonas.niklewski@kstr.lth.se; amir.naghibi@tvrl.lth.se; eva.fruhwald_hansson@kstr.lth.se,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,Sep.01,2023,243,,,,,,,,110703,10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110703,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110703,,Aug.23,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:001063288800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This work supports the premise that Solar Energy Density (SED) can be used as a benchmark to evaluate the dual performance of perforated screens (PS). Therefore, only irradiance calculations will be required in evaluations - instead of running three different simulations. Orthogonal Arrays and Principal Component Analysis were the statistical techniques used to select the PS sample and weight the simulation results. The resultant SED thresholds concurrently fostered the accomplishment of daylighting and energy goals, at five different orientations: they maximised the daylit area and minimised the overlit area and total energy use. This work also presents an application example of the single-metric approach to test its effectiveness to perform single-objective optimization of PS design by using Evolutionary Algorithms.

Adequate views to the outside are one of the most cited indoor qualities related to occupant well-being. However, due to urbanization and densification trends, designers may have difficulties in providing vistas and views to the outside with an assortment of content, which can support the needs of their occupants. To better understand occupant view satisfaction and provide reliable design feedback to architects, existing view satisfaction data must be expanded to capture a wider variety of view scenarios and occupants. Most related research remains challenging in architectural practice due to a lack of easy-to-use early design analysis tools. However, early assessment of view can be advantageous as design decisions in early design, such as building orientation, plan layout, and facade design, can improve the view quality. This paper, hence, presents results from a 181 participant view satisfaction survey with 590 window views. The survey data is used to train a tree-regression model to predict view satisfaction. The prediction performance was compared to an existing view assessment framework through case studies. The result showed that the new prediction (RMSE = 0.65) is more accurate to the surveyed result than the framework (RMSE = 3.78). Further, the prediction performance was generally high (R-2 >= 0.64) for most responses, verifying the reliability.

Therefore, this paper proposes an optimal design method for PVSDs to maximize energy performance by an optimized geometry and the proposed adaptive control model (ACM). Compared with previous studies, the proposed method integrates the influence of geometric parameters on energy performance, and the ACM proposed is able to adjust the tilt angle of PVSDs instantaneously based on real-time weather data. Subsequently, an office in Guangzhou was used as a case study for the evaluation to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that by using the optimized PVSDs, the cooling and lighting demand of the office is reduced by up to 48.7%.

This work proposes a new computational design methodology, intended for use in the area of conceptual design of building design. The proposed methodology is implemented into a multi-agent system design toolkit which facilitates the generation of design alternatives using stochastic algorithms and their evaluation using multiple environmental performance metrics. The method allows the user to probabilistically explore the solution space by modeling the design parameters' architectural design components (i.e. facade panel) into modular programming blocks (agents) which interact in a bottom-up fashion. Different problem requirements (i.e. level of daylight inside a space, openings) described into agents' behavior allow for the coupling of data from different engineering fields (environmental design, structural design) into the a priori formation of architectural geometry. In the presented design experiment, a facade panel is modeled into an agent-based fashion and the multi-agent system toolkit is used to generate and evolve alternative facade panel configurations based on environmental parameters (daylight, energy consumption). The designer can develop the facade panel geometry, design behaviors, and performance criteria to evaluate the design alternatives. The toolkit relies on modular and functionally specific programming modules (agents), which provide a platform for facade design exploration by combining existing three-dimensional modeling and analysis software.","[Pantazis, Evangelos; Gerber, David] Univ Southern Calif, Viterbi Sch Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Pantazis, E (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Viterbi Sch Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",epantazi@usc.edu,,,,,,,,14,16,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2018,16,4,,,SI,,248,270,,10.1177/1478077118805874,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1478077118805874,,,,Architecture,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000453098700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The authors employed Fast Fluid Dynamics simulation to study the natural ventilation performance of a pavilion and a genetic algorithm to optimize the shape of the pavilion's facades' openings. A performance analysis was conducted whereby an array of automated feedback loops carried out by a genetic algorithm produce a number of acceptable solutions.

However, these new design methods pose a question regarding the reasoning behind them, and sometimes the aesthetic interest dominates the true function of the envelope system and contrasts it. In opposite, too much engineering in the envelope system creates a problem with the identity of the facade. The purpose of this paper is to propose a method to integrate two different performances, quality and quantity, into one measurable goal. Using an existing building's facade as a case study, the building's facade was analyzed to understand the architect's logic behind its design. Then the found logic was programmed into the tool that allowed for the morphing of the facade into a different configuration, which can be evaluated by both quality and quantity performance to find the better solution to satisfy both goals. For the purpose of this paper, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms were considered to find solutions. For a quantitative objective, the indoor daylight availability was used as a measurement to allow for the best daylighting performance envelope system. For a qualitative objective, a matrix was developed to find the user's design preference and used it to evaluate and find a quantitative performance goal. The proposed method provides building facades that satisfy daylighting performance, and most importantly, it allows users to match their aesthetic sensibilities with the design preference.","[Yi, Yun Kyu] Univ Illinois, Sch Architecture, 117 Temple Hoyne Buell Hall,608 Lorado Taft Dr, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Yi, YK (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Sch Architecture, 117 Temple Hoyne Buell Hall,608 Lorado Taft Dr, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",ykyi@illinois.edu,,,,,,,,42,44,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2019,156,,,,,,178,190,,10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.04.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.04.002,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000466776900017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Application of artificial intelligence and drone setups in green buildings can help in providing the sustainable solution the world is striving for years. The contemporary research incorporates a novel concept of measuring the wearing thermal resistances in the building envelope with the aid of a drone system. The above procedure conducts a throughout building analysis by considering three prime environmental parameters such as wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH) and dry bulb temperature (DBT) with the aid of drone heat mapping procedure. The novelty of the study can be interpreted by the fact that prior researches have never explored the building envelope through a combination of drone and climatic conditions as variables in building areas difficult to access, thereby providing an easier, risk free, cost effective and efficient reading. Validation of the formula is authenticated by employing artificial intelligence-based software's which are applied for data prediction and optimization. Artificial models are established to validate the variables for each output from the specified number of climatic inputs.

This paper benchmarks seven different methods for characterization of the whole-building heat loss coefficient, including traditional gray box and novel black box approaches. To do so, a dataset of 16,000 simulated buildings is created. The models are benchmarked against ground truth, including an assessment of robustness to climate, construction materials, air-infiltration rate and occupant behaviour. We show the deep learning methods outperform other approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness, but that all of the approaches have limitations that restrain their practical usage.

Energy consumption across all sectors is identified as a crucial contributor to this challenge, with a number of legislative and regulatory frameworks and commitments to be introduced every year. In response to these trends, the concept of exploiting a building's thermal mass through the integration of phase change materials (PCMs) enhances the ability of building elements to reserve and deliver large amounts of energy during phase transitions. However, the incorporation of PCMs into building elements requires the thorough understanding of their thermal behaviour. This study evaluates and predicts the thermophysical properties of mineral particles carrying PCMs and coated with a cementitious layer able to be utilised as fillers in construction applications. By employing deep learning and predictive modelling techniques, the numerical data-driven model developed in this paper enhances accuracy and efficiency in property estimation and prediction, facilitating material selection, system design, and optimisation. A model in a MATLAB simulation environment is presented, evaluating and predicting the thermophysical properties of semi-organic particles able to enhance building envelope thermal mass as a hybrid energy storage solution. These findings show the time needed for a building block to undergo cooling, demonstrating a clear upgrade in the thermal discharge of the walls. Substituting traditional EP with PCM-enhanced EP leads to a minimum reduction of 1 & DEG;C per hour in the discharge rate, thereby extending the comfort duration of indoor spaces without necessitating additional space heating. These models offer the potential for assessing diverse material compositions and usage scenarios, offering valuable insights to aid decisions in optimizing building energy efficiency.","[Politi, Chrysa; Peppas, Antonis; Taxiarchou, Maria] Natl Tech Univ Athens NTUA, Sch Min & Met Engn, Athens 15780, Greece",,"Politi, C (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens NTUA, Sch Min & Met Engn, Athens 15780, Greece.",chrysapol@metal.ntua.gr; peppas@metal.ntua.gr; taxiarh@metal.ntua.gr,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2023,15,17,,,,,,,12863,10.3390/su151712863,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su151712863,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:001062342600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

One of the major research areas under this scope is the adaptive behavior of structural elements affected by load distribution. In order to achieve this, current studies develop structures that adapt by either following a database of precalculated equilibrium solutions or using self-learning algorithms to acquire active control systems to structures. This paper examined a case study element, which demonstrates an adaptive behavior in real time, based on self-learning abilities. The focus of this experiment was to gain control over a structural system as a whole (not only on a singular component) according to both objective and subjective parameters, that is, both load distribution parameters and spatial parameters, which are design related. The examined structural element was a canopy, situated in a dynamic environment that brought a change in the element's load distribution. The learning ability was given by applying a supervised learning algorithm-Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-on a physical prototype. The ANN was trained by an optimized database of finite solutions, which was created by a Genetic Algorithm. Through this method, complex calculations are conducted offline'', and the component operates in a decision-making'' mode in real time, adapting to a versatile environment while using minimal computational resources. Results show that the case study successfully exhibited self-learning and acquired the ability to adapt to unpredictable changing forces while keeping certain design requirements. This method can be applied over different structural elements (facade elements, canopies, structural components, etc.) to achieve adaptation to various parameters with an unpredictable pattern, such as human behavior or weather conditions.","[Sher, Elite; Glynn, Ruairi] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Chronis, Angelos] UCL, Bartlett Sch Grad Studies, Appl Res Dev Grp Foster Partners & Teaches, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London,"Sher, E (corresponding author), Flat 2,36 Alexandra Grove, London N12 8HG, England.",elitesher@gmail.com,,,,,,,,5,6,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2014,90,8,,,SI,,991,1006,,10.1177/0037549714543090,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0037549714543090,,,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000340717900009,View Full Record in Web of Science

A Bayesian network is developed, considering three levels of variables: characteristics of the building, facade and exposure conditions; causes of defects; and defects. To compute conditional probabilities, the results of an inspection campaign from the literature are used. Then, the proposed model is validated and verified using inspection results from another sample, the combination of a strength-of-influence diagram and sensitivity analysis and the application of the model to a case study. Results show that the probabilities computed by the model are a reasonable representation of the hesitancy in decision making during the diagnosis process based only on visual observation. For instance, design and execution errors show lower probabilities due to not being verifiable a posteriori without detailed documentation. The proposed model may be extended and replicated for other building materials in the future, as it may be a useful tool to improve the perception of uncertainty in a key stage of building maintenance or rehabilitation.","[Pereira, Clara; Silva, Ana; Ferreira, Claudia; de Brito, Jorge; Flores-Colen, Ines; Silvestre, Jose D.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, CERIS, Av Rovisco Pais 1, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"Pereira, C (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, CERIS, Av Rovisco Pais 1, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",clareira@sapo.pt; ana.ferreira.silva@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; claudiaarferreira@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; jb@civil.ist.utl.pt; ines.flores.colen@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; jose.silvestre@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2021,6,9,,,,,,,124,10.3390/infrastructures6090124,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/infrastructures6090124,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil; Transportation Science & Technology",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000702844200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To solve these problems, a dynamic intelligent building decision-making model was established in this study. The static and dynamic features of building retrofit decision-making were identified, four machine learning algorithms were considered, and a case base containing records for 301 retrofitted buildings was established for knowledge mining. The findings demonstrate that the XGBoost algorithm performs well in terms of building retrofit strategy prediction, with 77% accuracy for the prediction of building envelope retrofits and 76% accuracy for the prediction of HVAC system retrofits. In addition, the trends of building retrofit strategy decision-making considering dynamic climate conditions were observed. The demand for building envelope retrofitting and heating retrofitting has declined, while the demand for cooling retrofitting has increased. Some buildings are extremely sensitive to climate change, and some redundant retrofitting strategies should be avoided.

This leaves a dearth of knowledge on the influences of other disparate factors, such as the aesthetics of the building facade. This paper examines the effects of a deteriorated external wall paint on the tenants, rent and take-up of housing located in a high-end housing estate in Akure, Nigeria. The logic is to examine the place of aesthetics among the general factors affecting take-up and rental prices. Data were collected through census from 133 respondents residing in houses with deteriorated external wall paint. It applied both descriptive and multinomial logistic regression (MLR) to analyse the data. Findings Findings reveal that close to 60% of the respondents were psychologically affected by the visible deterioration of external wall paint. This translated to a significance reduction in rent compared with the rental prices of similar houses the appearance of which was not deteriorated. Generally, this study found that aesthetics paled into insignificance in the analysis of the general factors affecting housing take-up and rent. However, it ranked first when these were analysed on the structural characteristics of the house only. This is consistent with findings from the MLR parameter estimate, which shows that those who were psychologically affected are more likely to pay a 15% increase in their current rent to take up a similar house without paint deterioration. The findings of this study have implications on practice and theory. First, while the location mantra is a key determinant of rental prices in theory, in practice, rent on comparable houses could differ if the aesthetics of the external wall paint is compromised. This implies an avoidable loss of rent to the owner of a property who compromises the aesthetic quality of the external wall paint in a high-end location where affordability is arguably high. The implication on public authority is that a lower rent may have a negative implication on government revenue and specifically property tax which is normally based on market rent of a property. A novel quality of the study is that it separates the structural characteristics of a house from the general factors in order to examine the specific effect of deteriorated aesthetics of external wall paint on take-up and rent.","[Akinbogun, Solomon Pelumi; Aigbbavboa, Clinton] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn Built Environm, Dept Construct Management & Quant Surveying, Doornfontein Campus, Doornfontein, South Africa; [Gumbo, Trynos] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn Built Environm, Dept Town & Reg Planning, Doornfontein, South Africa",University of Johannesburg; University of Johannesburg,"Akinbogun, SP (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn Built Environm, Dept Construct Management & Quant Surveying, Doornfontein Campus, Doornfontein, South Africa.",akinbogunpelumi@yahoo.com; caigbavboa@uj.ac.za; tgumbo@uj.ac.za,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,Oct.19,2020,38,5,,,,,683,697,,10.1108/PM-11-2019-0066,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/PM-11-2019-0066,,,,Management,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000575110100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

To address this gap, a new procedure has been developed with a five-step optimization process relevant to examining urban forms with buildings density constraints, window-to-wall ratio, incident solar radiation and energy production potential in facades. Factors analyzed include floor space intensity (FSI), building height (H), spatial daylight autonomy (sDA), annual sun exposure (ASE) and the effect of facade tilt angles on efficiency targets in cold climates. A myriad of parametric functions has been incorporated in the process through Grasshopper, DIVA, ArchSIM, and evolutionary algorithms in Galapagos. The study revealed effective results of energy production across prominent facade design options. Increasing FSI was found to decrease sDA, for a fixed H. In contrast, increasing H for a fixed FSI decreased sDA with an insignificant magnitude of 4%. The ratio of increase in glazing to increase in sDA was in the order of 1:1.47. Overall, the findings showed novelty in optimizing each facade panel to achieve best performance demonstrated by different urban densities with low/mid/high-rise building conditions. Energy production reached 13 kWh/m(2) with integrated photovoltaics, as a renewable source. High-rise buildings showed the best conceivable energy improvement as opposed to other height conditions.

However, the resolution of the LiDAR is not sufficient to identify and evaluate the facade surface features like edges and cracks. Generally, photographs provide a better interpretation of the linear characteristics. The complementary benefits of each allow exploring valuable spatial information with different surface detail levels. The paper introduces a flexible image-based approach for linear feature extraction from LiDAR point cloud. Initially, the algorithm converts the point clouds into a structured depth image to reduce the complexity and computation time. Using transformation matrix and camera calibration parameters, the visible point clouds are perceptively projected into color image space using co-linearity equations. The result depth channel is sampled with the interpolation process and added to the color channels to compute (RGBD) layers. The edges and linear features of the surface are initially extracted using the optical 2D imagery and subsequently, each pixel of the linear features can be projected directly into 3D space. Due to the various acquisition positions of the laser and color images, the issue of occlusion is resolved using the visibility algorithm. Applying the methodology, experimental results from the Treasury Monument of Jordan's ancient Petra City, indicate that the developed approach provides adequate contour points for better interpretation and quantification of weathering processes and dangerous cracking. 3D Modeling these features can also reduce data size, facilitating surface inspection and analysis with simpler models.","[Alshawabkeh, Yahya] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Architecture & Planning, Dept Geomat, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",King Abdulaziz University,"Alshawabkeh, Y (corresponding author), King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Architecture & Planning, Dept Geomat, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.",yalshawabkeh@kau.edu.sa,,,,,,,,22,22,,,,,,,,,,,Mar.18,2020,8,1,,,,,,,28,10.1186/s40494-020-00371-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40494-020-00371-6,,,,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Analytical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Spectroscopy",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000520486500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The automation of these tools allows for temporal savings and has become a strong aid for professionals, so that more and more methods are developed with this objective. In this article, a method for 3D mesh segmentation focused on the representation of historic buildings is proposed. This type of buildings is characterised by having singularities and features in facades, such as doors or windows. The main objective is to recognise these features, understanding them as those parts of the model that differ from the main structure of the building. The idea is to use a recognition algorithm for planar faces that allows users to create a graph showing the connectivity between them, therefore allowing the reflection of the shape of the 3D model. At a later step, this graph is matched against some pre-defined graphs that represent the patterns to look for. Each coincidence between both graphs indicate the position of one of the characteristics sought.

In this paper, patch-wise detection of the points of window frames on facades and roofs are undertaken using this kind of data. A density-based multi-scale filter is devised in the feature space of normal vectors to globally handle the matter of high volume of data and to detect edges. Color information is employed for the downsized data to remove the inner clutter of the building. Perceptual organization directs the approach via grouping and the Gestalt principles, to segment the filtered point cloud and to later detect window patches. The evaluation of the approach displays a completeness of 95% and 92%, respectively, as well as a correctness of 95% and 96%, respectively, for the detection of rectangular and partially curved window frames in two big heterogeneous cluttered datasets. Moreover, most intrusions and protrusions cannot mislead the window detection approach. Several doors with glass parts and a number of parallel parts of the scaffolding are mistaken as windows when using the large-scale object detection approach due to their similar patterns with window frames. Sensitivity analysis of the input parameters demonstrates that the filter functionality depends on the radius of density calculation in the feature space. Furthermore, successfully employing the Gestalt principles in the detection of window frames is influenced by the width determination of window partitioning.","[Malihi, Shirin; Zoej, Mohammad Javad Valadan; Mokhtarzade, Mehdi] KN Toosi Univ Technol, Fac Geodesy & Geomat Engn, Tehran 1966715433, Iran; [Malihi, Shirin] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Geodesy & Photogrammetry, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [Hahn, Michael] Univ Appl Sci, Fac Geomat Comp Sci & Math, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany",K.

Its thin, repeating and complex structures also make it a valuable dataset for testing related algorithms and approaches for the reconstruction of 3D construction site scene. To this end, we present a data driven workflow for the detection and reconstruction of scaffolding components, including tubes, toeboards, and decks, given a photogrammetric point cloud.

The other part relates to the point feature derivation using a novel 3D local feature descriptor LSSHOT, designed for extracting features in the classification of points. Specifically, our workflow is implemented by five major steps, including preprocessing of the point cloud, division of building facades, classification of points, geometric modeling and refinement of results. To evaluate our proposed descriptor, a series of simulated experiments using synthetic datasets is conducted via shape matching tests.

Results of simulated experiments reveal that our proposed descriptor outperforms the original SHOT descriptor in the simulated test, especially when dealing with point clouds having a large percentage of noise. Regarding the real application of reconstructing scaffolds, points of scaffolds are successfully detected, extracted, and reconstructed. For a facade having enough points, over 70% of the scaffolding elements are reconstructed. For the classification of points using LSSHOT descriptor and a random forest classifier, the accuracy of results for the points of two major scaffolding elements reaches more than 70% in our test examples.","[Xu, Yusheng; Tuttas, Sebastian; Hoegner, Ludwig; Stilla, Uwe] Tech Univ Muenchen, Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Xu, YS (corresponding author), Tech Univ Muenchen, Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",yusheng.xu@tum.de,,,,,,,,38,41,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2018,85,,,,,,76,95,,10.1016/j.autcon.2017.09.014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2017.09.014,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000424071900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this scope, the development and application of image-based methods for evaluating and monitoring the state of conservation of buildings has shown significant growth, including support for maintenance plans. Recently, powerful algorithms have been applied to automatically evaluate the state of conservation of buildings using deep learning frameworks, which are utilised as a black-box approach. The large amount of data required for training, the difficulty in generalising, and the lack of parameters to assess the quality of the results often make it difficult for non-experts to evaluate them. For several applications and scenarios, simple and more intuitive image-based approaches can be applied to support building inspections. This paper presents the StainView, which is a fast and reliable method. The method is based on the classification of the mosaic image, computed from a systematic acquisition, and allows one to (i) map stains in facades; (ii) locate critical areas; (iii) identify materials; (iv) characterise colours; and (v) produce detailed and comprehensive maps of results. The method was validated in three identical buildings in Bairro de Alvalade, in Lisbon, Portugal, that present different levels of degradation. The comparison with visual inspection demonstrates that StainView enables the automatic location and mapping of critical areas with high efficiency, proving to be a useful tool for building inspection: differences were of approximately 5% for the facade with the worst and average state of conservation, however, the values deteriorate for the facade under good conditions, reaching the double of percentage. In terms of processing speed, StainView allows a facade mapping that is 8-12 times faster, and this difference tends to grow with the number of evaluated facades.","[Torres-Gonzales, Marta] Univ Seville, Dept Architectural Construct 2, Seville 41004, Spain; [Torres-Gonzales, Marta; Valenca, Jonatas; Silva, Ana; Mendes, Maria P.] ULisboa, IST ID, CERIS, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Santos, Bruno O.] ULisboa, IST, CERIS, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",University of Sevilla; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"Valença, J (corresponding author), ULisboa, IST ID, CERIS, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",mtorres18@us.es; jonatas.valenca@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; oliveirasantos@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; ana.ferreira.silva@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; mpaulamendes@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,Jun.01,2023,15,11,,,,,,,2895,10.3390/rs15112895,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15112895,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:001004729000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Social and economical change is predicted by numerous company leaders, politicians and researchers. Machine and Deep Learning (ML/DL) are sub-types of AI, which are gaining high interest within the community of data scientists and engineers worldwide. Obviously, this global trend does not stop at structural glass engineering, so that, the first part of the present paper is concerned with introducing the basic theoretical frame of AI and its sub-classes of ML and DL while the specific needs and requirements for the application in a structural engineering context are highlighted. Then this paper explores potential applications of AI for different subjects within the design, verification and monitoring of facades and glass structures. Finally, the current status of research as well as successfully conducted industry projects by the authors are presented. The discussion of specific problems ranges from supervised ML in case of the material parameter identification of polymeric interlayers used in laminated glass or the prediction of cut-edge strength based on the process parameters of a glass cutting machine and prediction of fracture patterns of tempered glass to the application of computer vision DL methods to image classification of the Pummel test and the use of semantic segmentation for the detection of cracks at the cut edge of glass. In the summary and conclusion section, the main findings for the applicability and impact of AI for the presented structural glass research and industry problems are compiled. It can be seen that in many cases AI, data, software and computing resources are already available today to successfully implement AI projects in the glass industry, which is demonstrated by the many current examples mentioned. Future research directories however will need to concentrate on how to introduce further glass-specific theoretical and human expert knowledge in the AI training process on the one hand and on the other hand more pronunciation has to be laid on the thorough digitization of workflows associated with the structural glass problem at hand in order to foster the further use of AI within this domain in both research and industry.","[Kraus, M.

The development of semantic segmentation methods is inextricably linked to datasets. The available building facade datasets suffer from a lack of abundant semantic categories and data completeness. To compensate for these shortcomings, we propose a new building facade dataset characterized by various categories and relatively complete 3-D building facades. In addition, most existing methods focus on fully supervised learning, which relies on manually labeling large-scale point cloud data and results in high time and labor costs. In this article, we propose an effective weakly supervised building facade segmentation approach, called spatial adaptive fusion consistency contrastive constraint (SAF-C3), to solve the above problem. We first design a multirandom point cloud augmentor as an auxiliary supervision branch to enhance the learning ability of the original network branch. Then, we present a spatial adaptive fusion (SAF) module to extract discriminative features for building facade point clouds. Finally, we propose a spatial consistency contrastive constraint to explore the contrastive property in feature space and to ensure the predictive consistency among the augmentation and original branches. The proposed method achieves a significant performance improvement against the state-of-the-art methods on two building facade point cloud datasets through extensive experiments.

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors are effective in recognizing building facade components from (three-dimensional) 3D point clouds by regis-tering 3D spatial coordinates and radiometric information, which reveal the spectral property of a scanned surface. Although the radiometric information (i.e., intensity feature) can be used for segmentation, its accuracy may be reduced by factors such as scanning geometry and external factors that affect the object's radiometric information. To address this issue, this study proposes a robust and automated method for segmenting building facade components using LiDAR point cloud data and an empirical-based intensity correction model to ensure proper segmentation. The proposed method employs RandLA-Net, a deep learning model capable of effectively processing large-scale point cloud data, to classify building facade components based on their spatial features combined with corrected intensity features. By incorporating the proposed method into a digital twin, it is possible to perform accurate building facade segmentation and generate valuable insights into the building's physical condition, energy efficiency, and aesthetic value in real-time.

Based on forecast precipitation, topography, and pipe networks, flood simulations can provide early warnings for areas and buildings at risk of flooding. Basement windows, doors, and underground garage entrances are common places where floodwater can flow into a building. Some buildings have been prepared or designed considering the threat of flooding, but others have not. Therefore, knowing the heights of these facade openings helps to identify places that are more susceptible to water ingress. However, such data is not yet readily available in most cities. Traditional surveying of the desired targets may be used, but this is a very time-consuming and laborious process. Instead, mobile mapping using LiDAR (light detection and ranging) is an efficient tool to obtain a large amount of high-density 3D measurement data. To use this method, it is required to extract the desired facade openings from the data in a fully automatic manner. This research presents a new process for the extraction of windows and doors from LiDAR mobile mapping data. Deep learning object detection models are trained to identify these objects. Usually, this requires to provide large amounts of manual annotations. In this paper, we mitigate this problem by leveraging a rule-based method. In a first step, the rule-based method is used to generate pseudo-labels. A semi-supervised learning strategy is then applied with three different levels of supervision. The results show that using only automatically generated pseudo-labels, the learning-based model outperforms the rule-based approach by 14.6% in terms of F1-score. After five hours of human supervision, it is possible to improve the model by another 6.2%. By comparing the detected facade openings' heights with the predicted water levels from a flood simulation model, a map can be produced which assigns per-building flood risk levels. Thus, our research provides a new geographic information layer for fine-grained urban emergency response. This information can be combined with flood forecasting to provide a more targeted disaster prevention guide for the city's infrastructure and residential buildings. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to achieve such a large scale, fine-grained building flood risk mapping.","[Feng, Yu; Xiao, Qing; Brenner, Claus; Feuerhake, Udo; Sester, Monika] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Cartog & Geoinformat, Appelstr 9a, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Peche, Aaron] Bpi Hannover Beratende Ingn, Mengendamm 16d, D-30177 Hannover, Germany; [Peche, Aaron] Fed Inst Geosci & Nat Resources, D-30655 Hannover, Germany; [Yang, Juntao] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geomat, Qingdao 266590, Peoples R China; [Yang, Juntao] China Univ Geosci, Sch Land Sci & Technol, 29 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",Leibniz University Hannover; Shandong University of Science & Technology; China University of Geosciences,"Feng, Y (corresponding author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Cartog & Geoinformat, Appelstr 9a, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",yu.feng@ikg.uni-hannover.de,,,,,,,,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2022,93,,,,,,,,101759,10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2022.101759,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2022.101759,,Feb.22,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Studies; Geography; Operations Research & Management Science; Regional & Urban Planning",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000754069600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The image masks were then employed during dense image matching in order to constraint the process into the respective classes, thus automatically creating semantically classified point clouds as the final output. Results show that the developed method is promising, with automation of the whole process feasible from input (images) to output (labelled point clouds).

However, due to the sensor noise, high redundancy, incompleteness, and complexity of airborne LiDAR systems, point cloud classification is challenging. Traditional point cloud classification methods mostly focus on the development of handcrafted point geometry features and employ machine learning-based classification models to conduct point classification. In recent years, the advances of deep learning models have caused researchers to shift their focus towards machine learning-based models, specifically deep neural networks, to classify airborne LiDAR point clouds. These learning-based methods start by transforming the unstructured 3D point sets to regular 2D representations, such as collections of feature images, and then employ a 2D CNN for point classification. Moreover, these methods usually need to calculate additional local geometry features, such as planarity, sphericity and roughness, to make use of the local structural information in the original 3D space. Nonetheless, the 3D to 2D conversion results in information loss. In this paper, we propose a directionally constrained fully convolutional neural network (D-FCN) that can take the original 3D coordinates and LiDAR intensity as input; thus, it can directly apply to unstructured 3D point clouds for semantic labeling. Specifically, we first introduce a novel directionally constrained point convolution (D-Conv) module to extract locally representative features of 3D point sets from the projected 2D receptive fields. To make full use of the orientation information of neighborhood points, the proposed D-Conv module performs convolution in an orientation-aware manner by using a directionally constrained nearest neighborhood search. Then, we design a multiscale fully convolutional neural network with downsampling and upsampling blocks to enable multiscale point feature learning. The proposed D-FCN model can therefore process input point cloud with arbitrary sizes and directly predict the semantic labels for all the input points in an end-to-end manner. Without involving additional geometry features as input, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance on the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) 3D labeling benchmark dataset. The results show that our model achieves a new stateof-the-art performance on powerline, car, and facade categories. Moreover, to demonstrate the generalization abilities of the proposed method, we conduct further experiments on the 2019 Data Fusion Contest Dataset.

We create the index by comparing the actual paths taken by pedestrians with the shortest path between any origin-destination pairs. The index captures pedestrians' willingness to deviate from their shortest path and provides a measure of the scenic and experience value provided by different parts of the city. We then use computer vision techniques combined with georeferenced data to measure the built environment of streets.

Our approach combines structure from motion (SfM) with deep-learning-based segmentation techniques. Given multiple-view images of a building, we compute a three-dimensional (3D) planar abstraction (LOD2 model) of its point cloud using SfM techniques. To obtain LOD3 models, we use deep learning to perform semantic segmentation of the openings in the two-dimensional (2D) images. Unlike existing approaches, we do not rely on complex input, pre-defined 3D shapes or manual intervention. To demonstrate the robustness of our method, we show that it can generate 3D building shapes from a collection of building images with no further input. For evaluating reconstructions, we also propose two novel metrics. The first is a Euclidean-distance-based correlation of the 3D building model with the point cloud. The second involves re-projecting 3D model facades onto source photos to determine dice scores with respect to the ground-truth masks. Finally, we make the code, the image datasets, SfM outputs, and digital twins reported in this work publicly available in github.com/eesd-epfl/LOD3_buildings and doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6651663.

Within this context artificial intelligence techniques have been successfully used to control active thermal energy storage units. This paper uses an experimentally validated numerical tool to study the effect of different control strategies on the performance of one TES system applied to the building sector, a ventilated facade with PCM which uses free cooling. Three different strategies were designed to control the ventilated facade based on cost savings, energy reduction and CO2 mitigation, under different climatic conditions. Results show robust benefits in the three tested control strategies, achieving average savings in comparison to a manual operation of the system of 4.3%, 7.8%, and 16.7%.

The Fourier theoretical model which is traditionally used to model such enclosures is not capable of considering several factors that affect a prediction that is often incorrect. These results motivate us to try to obtain a better thermal model of the enclosure. For this reason, a connexionist model is provided capable of modelling the behaviour of the enclosure from actual observed temperature data. For the training of this model, several measurements have been obtained over the course of more than one year in a specific enclosure, distributing the readings among the different layers of it. In this work, the predictions of both the theoretical model and the connexionist model have been tested, contrasting them with the measurements obtained previously. It has been observed that the connexionist model substantially improves the theoretical predictions of the Fourier method, thus allowing better approximations to be made regarding the real energy consumption of the building and, in general, the prediction of the energy behaviour of the enclosure.","[Aznar, Fidel; Rizo, Ramon] Univ Alicante, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Alicante, Spain; [Echarri, Victor; Rizo, Carlos] Univ Alicante, Dept Architectural Construct, Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant,"Aznar, F (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Alicante, Spain.",fidel@dccia.ua.es,,,,,,,,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,Dec.21,2018,13,12,,,,,,,e0207616,10.1371/journal.pone.0207616,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0207616,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000454149400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we propose a building damage detection framework based on the boundary refined supervoxel segmentation and random forest-latent Dirichlet allocation classification. First, the traditional supervoxel segmentation method is improved to segment the point clouds into good boundary refined supervoxels. Then, non-building points such as ground and vegetation are removed from the generated supervoxels. Next, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model is used to construct the high-level feature representation for each building supervoxel based on the selected 2D image and 3D point features. Finally, LDA model and random forest algorithm are employed to identify the damaged building regions. This method is applied to oblique photogrammetric point clouds collected from the Beichuan Country Earthquake Site. The research achieves the 3D damage assessment for building facade and roof. The result demonstrates that the proposed framework is capable of achieving around 94% accuracy for building point extraction and around 90% accuracy for damage identification.

After all the points in each contour area are extracted, a classification based on principal component analysis (PCA) method is adopted to identify building objects from point clouds extracted in contour areas. Then, all the points in a building object are segmented into different planes using the random sample consensus algorithm. For each building, points in facade planes are chosen to calculate the direction, the start point, and the end point of the facade footprints using PCA. Finally, footprints of different facades of building are refined, harmonized, and joined. Two data sets of downtown areas and one data set of a residential area captured by Optech's LYNX mobile mapping system were tested to verify the validities of the proposed method.

Thus the identification and modeling of this valuable information facilitates the reconstruction of these buildings and their parts. This article presents a novel approach for the automatic identification and modelling of symmetries and their hierarchical structures in building footprints, providing an important prior for facade and roof reconstruction. The uncertainty of symmetries is explicitly addressed using supervised machine learning methods, in particular Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Unlike classical statistical methods, for SVMs assumptions on the a priori distribution of the data are not required. Both axial and translational symmetries are detected. The quality of the identified major and minor symmetry axes is assessed by a least squares based adjustment. Context-free formal grammar rules are used to model the hierarchical and repetitive structure of the underlying footprints. We present an algorithm which derives grammar rules based on the previously acquired symmetry information and using lexical analysis describing regular patterns and palindrome-like structures. This offers insights into the latent structures of building footprints and therefore describes the associated facade in a relational and compact way.","[Dehbi, Youness; Groeger, Gerhard; Pluemer, Lutz] Univ Bonn, Inst Geodesy & Geoinformat, Meckenheimer Allee 172, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn,"Dehbi, Y (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Inst Geodesy & Geoinformat, Meckenheimer Allee 172, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",dehbi@igg.uni-bonn.de,,,,,,,,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2016,20,5,,,,,645,663,,10.1111/tgis.12177,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tgis.12177,,,,Geography,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000385267600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We find that a multi-class model trained on hand-labeled pixels containing Sky, Clouds, Vegetation, Water, Building facades, Windows, Roads, Cars, and Metal structures yields an accuracy of 90-97% for three different scenes. We assess the transferability of this model by training on one scene and testing to another with significantly different illumination conditions and/or different content. This results in a significant (similar to 45%) decrease in the model precision and recall as does training on all scenes at once and testing on the individual scenes. These results suggest that while CNNs are powerful tools for pixel-level classification of very high-resolution spectral data of urban environments, retraining between scenes may be necessary. Furthermore, we test the dependence of the model on several instrument- and data-specific parameters including reduced spectral resolution (down to 15 spectral channels) and number of available training instances. The results are strongly class-dependent; however, we find that the classification of natural materials is particularly robust, especially the Vegetation class with a precision and recall >94% for all scenes and model transfers and >90% with only a single training instance.","[Qamar, Farid; Dobler, Gregory] Univ Delaware, Biden Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Qamar, Farid] Univ Delaware, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Dobler, Gregory] Univ Delaware, Dept Phys & Astron, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Dobler, Gregory] Univ Delaware, Data Sci Inst, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Dobler, Gregory] NYU, Ctr Urban Sci & Progress, New York, NY 11201 USA",University of Delaware; University of Delaware; University of Delaware; University of Delaware; New York University,"Qamar, F (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Biden Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Newark, DE 19716 USA.;Qamar, F (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",qamar@udel.edu; gdobler@udel.edu,,,,,,,,12,12,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2020,12,16,,,,,,,2540,10.3390/rs12162540,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12162540,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000565448000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This identification facilitates the annotation of any visual object to a building's facade and is an essential step in a variety of applications, such as automatic target detection in surveillance, real-time robot localization and visual navigation, architectural design, and 3D city reconstruction. Because of its importance, a significant number of building recognition systems have been proposed in recent years. Nevertheless, there is no systematic survey of building recognition in urban environments yet. To this end, we present a comprehensive review of the dominant building recognition systems by first grouping them into two categories: (i) effectiveness approaches that mainly focus on the improvement of recognition performance and (ii) efficiency methods that attempt to enhance the recognition speed. Effectiveness approaches are further categorized into two different groups: (i) feature representation-based algorithms and (ii) wide baseline matching-based methods. Efficiency methods are divided into: (i) dimensionality reduction-based methods and (ii) clustering-based algorithms. We provide analysis and discussions on each type of method and summarize their, advantages and weaknesses in depth. Furthermore, we outline future research directions and associated challenges in this promising area.

Existing methods lack efficiency, robustness, and accuracy, and depend on many additional features such as point cloud reflectivity and color. This paper proposes a robust and automatic method to extract building facade maps. First, an improved 3D Hough transform is proposed by adding shift vote and 3D convolution of the accumulator to improve computational efficiency and reduce peak fuzziness and dependence on the step selection. These modifications make the extraction of potential planes fast and accurate. Second, the coplane and vertical plane constraints are introduced to eliminate pseudoplanes and nonbuilding facades. Then, we propose a strategy to refine the potential facade and to achieve the accurate calibration and division of the adjacent facade boundaries by clustering the refined point clouds of the facade. This process solves the problem where adjoining surfaces are merged into the same surface in the traditional method. Finally, the extracted facade point clouds are converted into feature images. Doors, windows, and building edges are accurately extracted via deep learning and digital image processing techniques, which combine to achieve accurate extraction of building facades. The proposed method was tested on the MLS and TLS point cloud datasets, which were collected from different cities with different building styles. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method decreases computational burden, improves efficiency, and achieves the accurate differentiation of adjacent facade boundaries with higher accuracy compared with the traditional method, verifying the robustness of the method. Additionally, the proposed method uses only point cloud geometry information, effectively reducing data requirements and acquisition costs.","[Yu, Bing; Hu, Jinlong; Dong, Xiujun; Xiao, Dongsheng; Wu, Tao; Hu, Yunliang; Wang, Bing] Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geomat, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China; [Dong, Xiujun; Dai, Keren] Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Geohazard Prevent & Geoenvironm Pro, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Dai, Keren] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Earth Sci, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bo] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Fac Geosci & Environm Engn, Chengdu 611756, Peoples R China",Southwest Petroleum University; Chengdu University of Technology; Chengdu University of Technology; Southwest Jiaotong University,"Dong, XJ (corresponding author), Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geomat, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China.;Dong, XJ (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Geohazard Prevent & Geoenvironm Pro, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China.",dongxiujun@cdut.cn,,,,,,,,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2022,14,16,,,,,,,3848,10.3390/rs14163848,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14163848,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000845285400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, many office buildings use large windows and glass facades to let more daylight into office spaces. However, this increases the chance of glare in office spaces, which results in visual discomfort. Shading systems in buildings can prevent glare but are not effectively adapted to changing sky conditions and sun position, thus losing valuable daylight. Moreover, many shading systems are also aesthetically unappealing. Electrochromic (EC) glass in this regard might be a better alternative, due to its light transmission properties that can be altered when a voltage is applied. EC glass facilitates zoning and also supports control of each zone separately. This allows the right amount of daylight at any time of the day. However, an effective control strategy is still required to efficiently control EC glass. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising control strategy that can learn from rewards and penalties and use this feedback to adapt to user inputs. We trained a Deep Q learning (DQN) agent on a set of weather data and visual comfort data, where the agent tries to adapt to the occupant's feedback while observing the sun position and radiation at given intervals. The trained DQN agent can avoid bright daylight and glare scenarios in 97% of the cases and increases the amount of useful daylight up to 90%, thus significantly reducing the need for artificial lighting.","[Kalyanam, Raghuram; Hoffmann, Sabine] Univ Kaiserslautern, Fac Civil Engn, Paul Ehrlich Str 14, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany",University of Kaiserslautern,"Kalyanam, R; Hoffmann, S (corresponding author), Univ Kaiserslautern, Fac Civil Engn, Paul Ehrlich Str 14, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany.",raghuramkalyanam@gmail.com; Sabine.Hoffmann@bauing.uni-kl.de,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2021,11,15,,,,,,,6949,10.3390/app11156949,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app11156949,,,,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000681848100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Images acquired in visible and thermal infrared spectra serve as input data for the camera pose estimation and the reconstruction of 3D scene geometry. To investigate the relevance of different information types to the classification performance, a Random Forest algorithm is applied to various sets of computed features. The best feature combination is then used as an input for a Conditional Random Field that enables us to incorporate contextual information and consider the interaction between the points. The evaluation executed on a per-point level shows that the fusion of all available information types together with context consideration allows us to extract objects with 90% completeness and 95% correctness.

Further, the point cloud is sliced along the three coordinate axes after adjusting the point-cloud attitude of the building to ensure that its orientation is consistent with the Y-coordinate axis. Then, the feature points on each slice arc extracted, and straight-line-segment clustering is applied to the extracted feature points based on the cylinder growth method. Finally, the straight-line-segment fitting of the feature points is performed using the 1-norm minimum residual algorithm, and the endpoints of the straight line segment arc adjusted and refined. Subsequently, we validate the proposed method by applying it to several sets of experimental data; the experimental results exhibit improved accuracy, precision, and recall. The extraction accuracy of the straight line segment is half the average point spacing in the point cloud. The precision of the proposed method for extracting straight line segments is increased by 2.4% on average than that of the plane segmentation and image detection methods, whereas the recall is increased by 18.1% on average.

Circa 28% of this energy demand is attributed to space heating and cooling, primarily influenced by the building's envelope and need to ensure indoor thermal comfort. Given this significant energy consumption, there is an urgent imperative to explore energy-saving strategies and develop tools to assess the effects of various design alternatives, with a focus on wall and roof characteristics. While existing white and black-box predictive models lack generalisation capabilities, the goal of this study is to develop and train a domain-informed grey-box Deep Learning model called Temp-AI -Estimator to predict the indoor temperature of buildings and containers (acting as surrogates for residential or office buildings as well as intermodal containers) based on measurements of external meteorological conditions (e.g. exterior temperature, humidity, etc.), as well as physical properties due to building construction set-ups in questions (ThermoProtect (thin coating), ThermoActive (thick coating) and thermal insulation). The major difficulty lies in making the model generalise beyond the three geographical locations included in the dataset (Berlin, Abu Dhabi, Texel). Experiments with LSTMs and Transformers as baseline models showed overfitting on the particular conditions at the sites in the training set, while failing to generalise to a new out-of-sample location. We propose to pass the model the numerical derivatives of the time-sequences, as these are less location-specific. The estimation of the necessary initial/final conditions is delegated to a very small network to minimise the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, we included a physically motivated module for modelling the latency and difference in amplitudes between exterior conditions and interior temperatures, informed by numerical approximation schemes of the differential equation of thermal conduction. Our experiments show that our domain-informed network achieves an increase in accuracy of almost 40% in addition to yielding results that can easily be inspected by human experts due to interpretability and explainability.","[Bischof, Rafael; Riedel, Henrik; Drass, Michael; Kraus, Michael A.] M&M Network Ing UG, Lennebergstr 40, D-55125 Mainz, Germany; [Sprenger, Marius; Walczok, Waldemar] SICC Coatings GmbH, Wackenbergstr 78-82, D-13156 Berlin, Germany; [Bumann, Matthias] dimagb, Wilhelminenhofstr 50, D-12459 Berlin, Germany",,"Kraus, MA (corresponding author), M&M Network Ing UG, Lennebergstr 40, D-55125 Mainz, Germany.",kraus@mm-network-ing.com,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,Oct.15,2023,297,,,,,,,,113425,10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113425,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113425,,Aug.23,,"Construction & Building Technology; Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:001055189500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study suggests a practical approach to the design of responsive building facades by integrating on-site sensors, building performance simulation (BPS), machine-learning, and 3D geometry modeling on a unified design interface. To this end, a novel and efficient hybrid optimization algorithm, tabu-based adaptive pattern search simulated annealing (T-APSSA), was developed and integrated with wireless sensor data communication (using nRF24L01 and ESP8266 WiFi modules) on a parametric visual programming language (VPL) interface Rhino Grasshopper (0.9.0076, McNeel, Seattle, USA). The effectiveness of T-APSSA for early-stage BPS and optimal design is compared with other metaheuristic algorithms, and the proposed framework is validated by experimental optimal envelope (window shading) designs for single (daylight) and multiple (daylight and energy) objectives. Test results demonstrate the improved efficiency of T-APSSA in calculations (two to four times faster than other algorithms).

The datasets present interior lighting conditions under different shading configurations in terms of surface colors and glossiness, horizontal and vertical orientations and upwards, downwards, and left/right inclinations of panels, V-shape opening, low to high densities, and top and bottom positions at the window.

For predicting masonry responses to seismic events in particular, equivalent frame models-a subcategory of macro-element models-are a common choice because of their low computational cost. However, an existing bottleneck in modeling pipelines is generating the geometry of the model, which is currently a slow and laborious process that is done manually using computer-aided design tools. In this paper, we address this by automating the modelling process using recent advancements in computer vision and machine learning. We present an image-based end-to-end pipeline that automatically generates finite element meshes for solid-element and equivalent-frame models of the outer walls of free-standing historical masonry buildings. As the input, our framework requires RGB images of the buildings that are processed using structure-from-motion algorithms, which create 3D geometries, and convolutional neural networks, which segment the openings and their corners. These layers are then combined to generate level of detail models. We tested our pipeline on structures with irregular surface geometries and opening layouts. While generating the solid element mesh from the level of detail model is straightforward, generating equivalent frame models required algorithms for segmenting the facade and the meshing. Experts in the field analyzed the generated equivalent frame models and determined them to be useful for numerical modeling. These finite element geometries will be invaluable for future predictions of the seismic response of damaged and undamaged buildings.

This paper presents a novel approach that combines photogrammetry and deep learning techniques to address the problem of BIPV decarbonization.

In addition, it enhances the precision and reliability of PV energy prediction by using artificial intelligence strategies. The primary aim of this approach is to offer advanced, data-driven energy forecasts and BIPV decarbonization while fully automating the underlying process. To achieve this, the first step is to capture point cloud data of the building through photogrammetric acquisition. This data undergoes preprocessing to identify and remove unwanted points, followed by plan segmentation to extract the plan facade. After that, a meteorological dataset is assembled, incorporating various attributes that influence energy production, including solar irradiance parameters as well as BIM parameters. Finally, machine and deep learning techniques are used for accurate photovoltaic energy predictions and the automation of the entire process. Extensive experiments are conducted, including multiple tests aimed at assessing the performance of diverse machine learning models. The objective is to identify the most suitable model for our specific application. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is undertaken, comparing the performance of the proposed model against that of various established BIPV software tools. The outcomes reveal that the proposed approach surpasses existing software solutions in both accuracy and precision.

The approach is based on the use of machine learning algorithms for the evaluation of different VF configurations and allows for the prediction of the temperatures in the cavities and of the heat fluxes. The authors trained different regression algorithms and obtained low prediction errors, in particular for temperatures. The authors used such models to simulate the thermo-physical behavior of the VFs and determined the most energy-efficient design variant.

Older buildings of 15 years and above and those with cementitious materials and paints as their predominant facade finishes were more likely to experience microbial decay than newer ones and those having refractory bricks, ceramic tiles, aluminium composite materials and plastics/polymers as their predominant facade finishes or claddings. Practical implications The study identifies the categories of buildings that are likely to be more susceptible to microbial decay; and thus contributes to research on how to slow down the rate of biodeterioration of building facade finishes or claddings in the hot-humid tropical environments. This is the first study on the susceptibility of buildings with different types of facade finishes or claddings to microbial decay in the hot-humid tropical environment of Enugu metropolis, southeast Nigeria. It also provides a clue on the age at which buildings become more vulnerable to microbial decay in the study area.","[Uzuegbunam, Francis O.; Ibem, Eziyi O.] Univ Nigeria, Fac Environm Studies, Dept Architecture, Enugu, Nigeria; [Isiofia, Lawrence A.] Enugu State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture, Enugu, Nigeria",University of Nigeria,"Uzuegbunam, FO (corresponding author), Univ Nigeria, Fac Environm Studies, Dept Architecture, Enugu, Nigeria.",francis.uzuegbunam@unn.edu.ng,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,2022 AUG 11,2022,,,,,,,,,,10.1108/IJBPA-02-2022-0028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJBPA-02-2022-0028,,Aug.22,,Construction & Building Technology,,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000838103100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We tackle this problem by combining the strengths of two popular domains: sketch-based modeling and procedural modeling. On the one hand, sketch-based modeling exploits our ability to draw but requires detailed, unambiguous drawings to achieve complex models. On the other hand, procedural modeling automates the creation of precise and detailed geometry but requires the tedious definition and parameterization of procedural models. Our system uses a collection of simple procedural grammars, called snippets, as building blocks to turn sketches into realistic 3D models. We use a machine learning approach to solve the inverse problem of finding the procedural model that best explains a user sketch. We use nonphotorealistic rendering to generate artificial data for training convolutional neural networks capable of quickly recognizing the procedural rule intended by a sketch and estimating its parameters. We integrate our algorithm in a coarse-to-fine urban modeling system that allows users to create rich buildings by successively sketching the building mass, roof, facades, windows, and ornaments. A user study shows that by using our approach non-expert users can generate complex buildings in just a few minutes.","[Nishida, Gen; Garcia-Dorado, Ignacio; Aliaga, Daniel G.; Benes, Bedrich] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Bousseau, Adrien] Inria, Rocquencourt, France",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Inria,"Nishida, G (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,,,,,,93,107,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2016,35,4,,,,,,,130,10.1145/2897824.2925951,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2897824.2925951,,,,"Computer Science, Software Engineering",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000380112400100,View Full Record in Web of Science

Procedural modeling has become popular in recent years to overcome this issue, but creating a grammar to get a desired output is difficult and time consuming even for expert users. In this paper, we present an interactive tool that allows users to automatically generate such a grammar from a single image of a building. The user selects a photograph and highlights the silhouette of the target building as input to our method. Our pipeline automatically generates the building components, from large-scale building mass to fine-scale windows and doors geometry. Each stage of our pipeline combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and optimization to select and parameterize procedural grammars that reproduce the building elements of the picture. In the first stage, our method jointly estimates camera parameters and building mass shape. Once known, the building mass enables the rectification of the facades, which are given as input to the second stage that recovers the facade layout. This layout allows us to extract individual windows and doors that are subsequently fed to the last stage of the pipeline that selects procedural grammars for windows and doors. Finally, the grammars are combined to generate a complete procedural building as output. We devise a common methodology to make each stage of this pipeline tractable. This methodology consists in simplifying the input image to match the visual appearance of synthetic training data, and in using optimization to refine the parameters estimated by CNNs. We used our method to generate a variety of procedural models of buildings from existing photographs.","[Nishida, Gen; Aliaga, Daniel G.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Bousseau, Adrien] Univ Cote dAzur, Inria, Nice, France",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Universite Cote d'Azur; Inria,"Nishida, G (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,,,,,,27,33,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2018,37,2,,,,,415,429,,10.1111/cgf.13372,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13372,,,,"Computer Science, Software Engineering",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000434085600037,View Full Record in Web of Science

On one hand, considering the laboratory as the grouping variable, it is important to assess the within-group and between-group variability in the measurements. On the other hand, in building acoustics, it is known that sound insulation is more variable at low frequencies (from 50 to 100Hz), compared with higher frequencies (up to 5000Hz), and therefore, a multilevel functional model is employed to decompose the functional variance both at the measurement level and at the group level. This decomposition also allows for the ranking of the laboratories on the basis of measurement variability and performance at low frequencies (relative high variability) and over the whole spectrum. The former ranking is obtained via the principal component scores and the latter via an original Bayesian extension of the functional depth.","[Argiento, Raffaele; Bissiri, Pier Giovanni; Pievatolo, Antonio] CNR, IMATI, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Scrosati, Chiara] CNR, ITC, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Matematica Applicata e Tecnologie Informatiche Enrico Magenes (IMATI-CNR); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per le Tecnologie della Costruzione (ITC-CNR),"Bissiri, PG (corresponding author), Univ Milano Bicocca, Ed U7,Via Bicocca degli Arcimboldi 8, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",pier.bissiri@unimib.it,,,,,,,,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2015,31,7,,,SI,,1239,1253,,10.1002/qre.1843,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qre.1843,,,,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000363876000013,View Full Record in Web of Science

The rule-based parsing boosts segmentation of simple and large structures such as street surfaces and building facades that span almost 75% of the point cloud data. For more complex structures, such as cars, trees and pedestrians, we adopt boosted decision trees that exploit both structure (LiDAR) and photometric (street view) features. We provide qualitative examples of our methodology in 3D visualization where we construct parametric graphical models from labelled data and in 2D image segmentation where 3D labels are back projected to the street view images.

In Building Information Modeling (BIM) studies, the detection of building facade elements has an important role. BIM is a tool that allows maintaining a digital representation of all aspects of building information; therefore, it will enable the storage of almost any data related to a given structure, regarding its geometric and non-geometric aspects. Facade segmentation was first studied in the 1970s using hand-crafted expertise. Later, detection and segmentation studies emerged based on shapes of objects and parametric rules. With the developing technology, deep learning approaches in object detection studies have intensified. It is obvious that the desired analyses can be performed faster with deep learning approaches. However, deep learning methods require large training data. Algorithms that consider different situations and are suitable for real-world scenarios continue to be developed. The need in this direction continues in the literature. In this study, door and window detection was carried out with deep learning on an original data set. The algorithms used are YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, and Faster R-CNN. Precision, recall and mean average precision (mAP) are used as evaluation metrics.

We use a very general framework of reversible jump MCMC, which allows simple implementation of a specific structure model and plug-in of almost arbitrary element classifiers. The MC controls the classifier by prescribing it where to look, without wasting too much time on unpromising locations.

We leverage a drone to film outer walls of high-rise buildings at several dozens of sites, from which training data are produced for learning and validation.

Core to our implementation is Jetson TX2-an embedded system-which is programmed in light of AlexNet over Keras and TensorFlow, opensource libraries for deep neural network programming. To heighten learning quality subject to limited amount of training data, image preprocessing involving gray-level transformation, thresholding, and morphological operations is introduced.

In contrast to roof surfaces, facades can not directly be reconstructed in a similar high level of quality from this data. Distortions of perspective might appear in images, due to the camera angle. Occlusions and shadowing occur as well. Objects, such as windows and doors, will have to be detected on such data if facades are to be reconstructed. Although one can use inpainting techniques to cover occluded areas, detection results are often incomplete and noisy. Formal grammars can then be used to align and add objects. However, it is difficult to find suitable rules for all types of buildings. We propose a post-processing approach based on neural networks to improve facade layouts. To this end, we applied existing Recurrent Neural Network architectures like Multi-Dimensional Long Short-term Memory Network and Quasi Recurrent Neural Network in a new context. We also propose a novel architecture, the Rotated Multi-Dimensional Long Short Term Memory. In order to deal with two-dimensional neighborhoods this architecture combines four two-dimensional Multi-Dimensional Long Short-term Memory Networks on rotated images.

The proliferation and growing sophistication of UAV in recent years has opened up many new opportunities for damage mapping, due to the high spatial resolution, the resulting stereo images and derivatives, and the flexibility of the platform. We have addressed the problem in the context of two European research projects, RECONASS and INACHUS.

The projects focused on damage to individual buildings caused by seismic activity but also explosions, and our work centred on the processing of 3D point cloud information acquired from stereo imagery. Initially focusing on the development of both supervised and unsupervised damage detection methods built on advanced texture features and basic classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Random Forest, the work moved on to the use of deep learning. In particular the coupling of image-derived features and 3D point cloud information in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) proved successful in detecting also subtle damage features. In addition to the detection of standard rubble and debris, CNN-based methods were developed to detect typical facade damage indicators, such as cracks and spalling, including with a focus on multi-temporal and multi-scale feature fusion. We further developed a processing pipeline and mobile app to facilitate near-real time damage mapping.

This application has the advantages of reducing time, labor, and safety concerns for inspection activities while solving problems of inaccessible building envelope components. Consequently, we used Infrared Thermal cameras installed on an Unmanned Aerial System to collect thermal images from building sites.

Current deep learning-based segmentation algorithms such as Mask R-CNN provide a mask of the real world (e.g. building facades) in a greedy manner, which, although quantitatively accurate, does not adhere to the needs of the AR advertisers for appropriate ad placement, such as ad size, mask continuity, etc. In this paper, we propose three intuitive metrics for evaluating building facade segmentation specifically for advertisement integration, namely, average discontinuity, normalized continuous area, and resolution ratio. Each of these metrics is inspired from the way advertisers may want to view segmentation results within an AR world editor, or the way users may want to experience AR advertisements. Experimental results on a test segmentation shows the importance of such intuitive metrics, where we show how an accurate placement area for a sample 2D advertisement can be easily isolated from a segmented facade using our metrics.","[True, Julian; Khan, Naimul] Ryerson Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada",Toronto Metropolitan University,"True, J (corresponding author), Ryerson Univ, Toronto, ON, Canada.",jtrue@ryerson.com; n77khan@ryerson.ca,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,,,,,,,411,415,,10.1109/BigMM.2019.00071,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/BigMM.2019.00071,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000534301200058,View Full Record in Web of Science

To support this argument, in this work we discuss the contribution of image semantic labelling towards image-based 3D reconstruction in photogrammetry. We experiment semantic information in various steps starting from feature matching to dense 3D reconstruction. Labelling in 2D is considered as an easier task in terms of data availability and algorithm maturity. However, since semantic labelling of all the images involved in the reconstruction may be a costly, laborious and time consuming task, we propose to use a deep learning architecture to automatically generate semantically segmented images. To this end, we have trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on historic building facade images that will be further enriched in the future.

Conventional supervised learning schemes excel in indoor scenes, but do not exhibit competitive performance when trained and deployed in outdoor environments. Furthermore, they involve complex network architectures and require many more trainable parameters. To tackle these challenges, we present an adversarial learning scheme that regularizes the output normal maps from a neural network to appear more realistic, by using a small number of precisely annotated examples.

This allows us to use RL to efficiently find the optimal parse of a given facade in terms of our shape grammar. Building on the RL paradigm, we exploit state aggregation to speedup computation, and introduce image-driven exploration in RL to accelerate convergence.

Since the disturbing objects can also be of a larger scale, modern deep learning techniques should be applied to replace them as realistically and context-aware as possible. To support an inpainting network, it is useful to include a-priori information. An example of a network that considers edge images is the two-stage GAN model denoted as EdgeConnect. This idea is taken up in this work and further developed to a three-stage GAN (3GAN) model for facade images by additionally incorporating semantic label images. By inpainting the label images, not only a clear geometric structure but also class information, like position and shape of windows and their typical color distribution, are provided to the model. This model is compared qualitatively and quantitatively with the conventional version of EdgeConnect and another well-known deep-learning-based approach on inpainting which is based on partial convolutions. This latter approach was outperformed by both GAN-based methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively. While the quantitative evaluation showed that the conventional EdgeConnect method performs minimally best, the proposed method yields a slightly better representation of specific facade elements.","[Kottler, Benedikt; List, Ludwig; Bulatov, Dimitri] Fraunhofer Inst Optron Syst Technol & Image Explo, Gutleuthausstr 1, D-76275 Ettlingen, Germany; [Weinmann, Martin] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Englerstr 7, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany","Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Fraunhofer Optronics, System Technologies & Image Exploitation Ettlingen; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology","Kottler, B (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Inst Optron Syst Technol & Image Explo, Gutleuthausstr 1, D-76275 Ettlingen, Germany.",,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,2022,,,,,,,427,435,,10.5220/0010830600003124,http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0010830600003124,,,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000777569400044,View Full Record in Web of Science

Contrary to existing methods that fuse visual and textual information at a feature-level, we propose a late fusion approach that combines visual and textual cues after resolving issues of incorrect digitization and semantic ambiguity of the retrieved textual components.

We propose using this technique to improve 3D urban reconstruction from street level imagery, in which building facades are frequently occluded by vegetation or vehicles. By assuming facades in the background are planar, 3D scene estimation provides important context to the inpainting process by restricting input sample patches to regions that are coplanar to the occlusion, leading to more realistic final textures.

The proposed method determines a set of candidate planes by sampling and clustering points from the image with Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), using local normal estimates derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to inform the planar model. The corresponding disparity map and a discriminative classification provide prior information for a two-layer Markov Random Field model. This MRF problem is solved via Graph Cuts to obtain a labeling of building facade pixels at the mid-level, and a segmentation of those pixels into particular planes at the high-level. The results indicate a strong improvement in the accuracy of the binary building detection problem over the discriminative classifier alone, and the planar surface estimates provide a good approximation to the ground truth planes.","[Delmerico, Jeffrey A.; Corso, Jason J.] SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [David, Philip] Army Res Lab, Adelphi, MD USA","State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; United States Department of Defense; United States Army; US Army Research, Development & Engineering Command (RDECOM); US Army Research Laboratory (ARL)","Delmerico, JA (corresponding author), SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",jad12@buffalo.edu; philip.j.david4.civ@mail.mil; jcorso@buffalo.edu,,,,,,,,21,24,,,,,,,,,,,,2011,,,,,,,1632,1639,,,,,,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Robotics",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000297477501149,View Full Record in Web of Science

The main steps of this work include: pose estimation, point cloud generation, and 3D modelling. After improving the initial values of interior and exterior parameters at first step, an efficient image matching technique such as Semi Global Matching (SGM) is applied on UAV images and a dense point cloud is generated. Then, a mesh model of points is calculated using Delaunay 2.5D triangulation and refined to obtain an accurate model of building.

Hence, in this paper, we try to explore the use of facade from the oblique images to enhance the accuracy of land-cover classification. Firstly, we locate the facades by finding the elevation changes and the corresponding above-ground objects. Then, the facade images are cropped from oblique images and the color and Haar-like features are extracted as facade features.

Our classifier first identifies the images containing buildings, then separates individual facades within an image and determines the building style.

Energy loss can be attributed to inefficiency and sub-surface defects in the structure that reduce the thermal resistance and facilitate unwanted heat transmission within the environment. In recent years, infrared (IR) thermography has proven to be an excellent tool for detecting heat loss from a building envelope. At the same time, advancements in computer vision systems have enabled the use of Structure from Motion (SfM) as a photogrammetry technique. SfM is used for the generation of three-dimensional (3D) building information modeling (BIM). It has the potential to facilitate remote visual inspection of large-scale structures and infrastructure systems by creating virtual renderings. The results of an experiment performed on a lab-scale building using both IR and SfM techniques is analyzed. In particular, the accuracy of SfM in generating a 3D virtual rendering of a target object by using images acquired from a low-cost IR camera is discussed.

In case of historic buildings with massive walls, internal insulation is often the only feasible post-insulation technique. Drawback of internal insulation is the modified hygrothermal response of the wall, which can result in moisture damage. Hence, it is crucial to assess the risk of damage accurately beforehand. Given the many uncertainties involved, a probabilistic assessment is advisable. This, however, would require thousands of simulations, which easily becomes computationally inhibitive. To overcome this time-efficiency issue, this paper proposes the use of neural networks to replace the original hygrothermal model. The neural network is trained on a small data set obtained from the hygrothermal model and can subsequently be used to predict the hygrothermal behaviour of building components with different boundary conditions and geometry. The transient nature of the hygrothermal behaviour requires a neural network type which can handle long-range time-dependencies. In the past, recurrent neural networks were often used for this type of data. Recently however, results indicate that convolutional neural networks can outperform recurrent neural networks on such tasks. This paper compares the prediction accuracy and training time of both neural network types for the prediction of the hygrothermal behaviour of building components.","[Tijskens, Astrid; Roels, Staf; Janssen, Hans] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Civil Engn, Bldg Phys Sect, Kasteelpk Arenberg 40 Bus 2447, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Tijskens, A (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Civil Engn, Bldg Phys Sect, Kasteelpk Arenberg 40 Bus 2447, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.",astrid.tijskens@kuleuven.be,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,282,,,,,,,,2036,10.1051/matecconf/201928202036,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/matecconf/201928202036,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Industrial",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000558388100037,View Full Record in Web of Science

Various building energy efficiency policies have been issued in many cities around the US, requiring the disclosure of buildings' energy performance and encourage building owners to take this information into consideration for retrofit investment decisions. However, various types of building information at different scales are meant to be collected and disclosed with costs that have substantial variations accordingly. Hence, complying with these policies is expensive and time-consuming for both government agencies and building owners. This paper proposes a non-intrusive and scalable data-driven approach to automatically capture energy-critical building characteristics to declare energy benchmarking or retrofitting policies. This approach first integrated open city data sets (building-related) and identified principal building variables in relation to energy performance indexes (i.e., electricity usage), then utilized transfer learning to retrain deep learning models on building facade images (retrieved from Google Street View) to extract their corresponding principal building variables. To elaborate, given a fully captured facade image of any building, this approach provides the data values for the identified principal variables (e.g., for a facade image given as an input, the outputs will include buildingType = Office). The best accuracy of the extraction model exceeds 80% in extracting building types from images, which indicates that the model is capable of extracting data values for the principal building variables that are essential for energy performance of buildings.","[Yu, Xinran; Ergan, Semiha] NYU, Dept Civil & Urban Engn, Brooklyn, NY 10003 USA",New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering,"Yu, XR (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Civil & Urban Engn, Brooklyn, NY 10003 USA.",celiayu@nyu.edu; semiha@nyu.edu,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2022,,,,,,,131,139,,,,,,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000948933100017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Moisture causes accelerated wear of facades, paint coatings, weakening of the wall structure, and high maintenance and renovation costs. The growth of fungi and bacteria worsens the indoor microclimate [1]. Effective identification of moisture inside the walls enables effective preventive actions. The paper presents an algorithmic concept that increases the quality of tomographic images showing the distribution of moisture inside the walls. The method solves the problem of monitoring the dampness of historical buildings and walls susceptible to moisture. The research focuses on solving the inverse problem of converting electrical measurements into spatial images. The study used a proprietary electrical impedance tomography system with specially designed electrodes. The measurement vector is converted to images in two stages. In the first stage, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was used, which generates raw reconstructions. The task of the second LSTM network is to convert the raw images obtained in the first stage into enhanced images. The application of the presented method is not limited to one type of narrow-sphere tomography. The two-stage approach can be easily adapted to, e.g., medical and industrial or process tomography.

Urban morphology determines the effectiveness of PV panels in the urban environment and hence it is important to design the new developments carefully. However, there is a lack of tool and knowledge to estimate the solar energy potential of a new planning zone, so this study developed morphological based PV output and energy consumption predictive models to identify the urban form for effective PV systems deployment by multilinear regression. Three equations are built for predicting the building cooling energy consumption, PV generation on rooftop and facade and the R-2 of these three equations are 0.33, 0.44 and 0.48 respectively. The regression equations show that the urban setting for maximizing PV generation and minimizing cooling energy consumption is different.

TLS is new and efficient method to digitize large object or scene. The collected point samples come into different formats and coordinates. Different scans are required to scan large object such as heritage site. Point cloud registration is considered as important task to bring different scans into whole 3D model in one coordinate system. Point clouds can be registered by using one of the three ways or combination of them, Target based, feature extraction, point cloud based. For the present study we have gone through Point Cloud Based registration approach. We have collected partially overlapped 3D Point Cloud data of Department of Computer Science & IT (DCSIT) building located in Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, Aurangabad. To get the complete point cloud information of the building we have taken 12 scans, 4 scans for exterior and 8 scans for interior facade data collection. There are various algorithms available in literature, but Iterative Closest Point (ICP) is most dominant algorithms. The various researchers have developed variants of ICP for better registration process. The ICP point cloud registration algorithm is based on the search of pairs of nearest points in a two adjacent scans and calculates the transformation parameters between them, it provides advantage that no artificial target is required for registration process. We studied and implemented three variants Brute Force, KDTree, Partial Matching of ICP algorithm in MATLAB. The result shows that the implemented version of ICP algorithm with its variants gives better result with speed and accuracy of registration as compared with CloudCompare Open Source software.","[Rajendra, Y.

Automatic processing of MLS point clouds for feature extraction on building facades is a demanding work. Point cloud segmentation and recognition are the most important steps in this context. In this paper, a new approach for automatic and fast processing of MLS data for the detection of building patches while restricting to segment other features is introduced. After filtering of the point clouds, the building facade extraction takes place. An initial building point cluster detection and roughness based point separation within the cluster itself are the preliminary stages of this process. Thereafter points are segmented into planar patches based on the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) technique, as most facades are dominated by planar faces. An intelligent seed point selection method is introduced, and growing rules are applied in order to extract the most significant planar features which represent the building facades. Each segmented plane is afterwards processed to recognize the facade features. A rule based partitioning tree, constructed from the 2D geometric knowledge of building features is used for facade feature recognition. The approach has been tested with several urban data sets, and results demonstrate that the method can be applied in an efficient modelling process.","[Arachchige, Nalani Hetti; Perera, Sanka Nirodha; Maas, Hans-Gerd] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, D-01069 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Arachchige, NH (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Helmholtz Str 10, D-01069 Dresden, Germany.",hetti_arachchige.nalani@mailbox.tu-dresden.de; sanka.perera@mailbox.tu-dresden.de; hans-gerd.maas@tu-dresden.de,,,,,,,,13,14,,,,,,,,,,,,2012,39-B5,,,,,,187,192,,,,,,,"Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000358240300032,View Full Record in Web of Science

The workflow has four main processing steps. Firstly, the raw point clouds are preprocessed by statistical filtering and voxel girding. In the second step, the planar surfaces of the building surface and scaffoldings are extracted via RANSAC and then grouped by their parallelity and distance to separate the building facade. In the third step, the 3D shape descriptor FPFH and random forest classification algorithm are applied to classify the point data of building facades into classes belonging to different elements. Finally, by the use of linear fitting algorithm and matching using SHOT shape descriptor, the tubes and toeboards are reconstructed with their geometric parameters. It is shown that the points belonging to these objects are identified and then reconstructed with cylinder and cuboid models. The final results show that over 60% of the tubes and nearly 90% of the toeboards are reconstructed in the investigated facade, and more than 40% of the reconstructed objects are well rebuilt.","[Xu, Y.; He, J.; Tuttas, S.; Stilla, U.] Tech Univ Munich, Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [He, J.] Wuhan Univ, Sch Resources & Environm Sci, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Xu, Y.] Tongji Univ, Coll Surveying & Geoinformat, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China",Technical University of Munich; Wuhan University; Tongji University,"Xu, Y (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",yusheng.xu@tum.de; sebastian.tuttas@tum.de; stilla@tum.de,,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,,2015,II-3,W5,,,,,401,408,,10.5194/isprsannals-II-3-W5-401-2015,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprsannals-II-3-W5-401-2015,,,,"Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000382326300054,View Full Record in Web of Science

Among the possible spatial data acquisition sensors, terrestrial laser scanning has been considered in several of the existing studies, mostly because of its high reliability, to cope with cracks and defect detection up to the millimeter level of resolution, which is the typical accuracy of the current generation of professional laser scanners.

Furthermore, we combine random sampling with a novel scoring function that rates the size of predictions. Decision trees were applied to identify the most evident features that are assessed by the scoring function. Finally, cluster analysis is employed to estimate those borders of the respective object that cannot be identified precisely by the parametric model.

It benefits from an extensive prior knowledge of probability density distributions and functional dependencies and allows for the incorporation of further structural characteristics such as symmetries. Bayesian networks are used to determine posterior beliefs. Stochastic reasoning is complex since the problem is characterized by a mixture of discrete and continuous parameters that are in turn correlated by nonlinear constraints. To cope with this kind of complexity, the implemented reasoner combines statistical methods with constraint propagation.

We assume that a substantial part of the data to guide artificial design technologies resides in existing design examples. Developing ways to use this data may enable improvements in intelligent design tools, with the hope that these may provide more effective design workflows and more productive design practices. Such improvements may result in more in-depth evaluations of potentials and alternatives for design situations; hence better planning for the spatial environment. Various approaches have been developed to use representations of architectural examples for artificially tackling architectural design tasks. This study presents a review of the historical development of these approaches, with an overall aim to investigate where and how design examples have been used for practical computational design applications. The review encompasses traditional and recent Shape Grammar and Procedural Modeling studies, Case-Based Design, Similarity-Based Evaluation and Design, and recent studies on the architectural uses of Machine Vision, Semantic Modeling, Machine Learning, and Classification. The emphasis of the review is on the studies that aim at designing or generating new design examples, particularly for building layouts, facades, envelopes, and massing. For a comparative evaluation of the current capabilities of the examined lineages of studies, we propose a minimum set of design capabilities, and assess each study through this framework. This reveals the overall patterns of already covered requirements. The review shows that initial hand-operated SGs gave way to automatic generation, which in turn developed into automated SG extraction, through increasing levels of computational capabilities. Case Based Design has been neglected; however, it can be reinvigorated through novel Al techniques. On the other hand, Similarity-Based Evaluation may complement and balance the orientation towards technical performance. Machine Learning and Computer Vision appear as potential intermediaries for connecting these threads. There are example-based studies towards almost all aspects of artificial design; yet, these have not been tackled adequately or definitively. In particular, dynamic process control is still only a future potential. On the other hand, the examined research lineages have the potential to assume complementary roles for more capable and multifaceted design systems. As an overall result, example-based research perspectives raise important possibilities for intelligent design systems.","[Sonmez, Nizam Onur] Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Architecture, Taskisla Campus,Taskisla St, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Technical University,"Sönmez, NO (corresponding author), Istanbul Tech Univ, Fac Architecture, Taskisla Campus,Taskisla St, Istanbul, Turkey.",sonmezon@itu.edu.tr,,,,,,,,28,32,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2018,96,,,,,,13,30,,10.1016/j.cad.2017.10.005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cad.2017.10.005,,,,"Computer Science, Software Engineering",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000424310300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nevertheless, despite being investigated for a few decades, the comprehensive reconstruction of buildings remains a challenging task. While there is a considerable body of literature on this topic, including several systematic reviews summarising ways of acquiring and reconstructing coarse building structures, there is a paucity of in-depth research on the detection and reconstruction of facade openings (i.e., windows and doors). In this review, we provide an overview of emerging applications, data acquisition and processing techniques for building facade reconstruction, emphasising building opening detection. The use of traditional technologies from terrestrial and aerial platforms, along with emerging approaches, such as mobile phones and volunteered geography information, is discussed. The current status of approaches for opening detection is then examined in detail, separated into methods for three-dimensional and two-dimensional data. Based on the review, it is clear that a key limitation associated with facade reconstruction is process automation and the need for user intervention. Another limitation is the incompleteness of the data due to occlusion, which can be reduced by data fusion. In addition, the lack of available diverse benchmark datasets and further investigation into deep-learning methods for facade openings extraction present crucial opportunities for future research.","[Klimkowska, Anna; Grebby, Stephen] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Geospatial Inst, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham NG7 2TU, England; [Cavazzi, Stefano] Ordnance Survey, Adanac Dr, Southampton SO16 0AS, Hants, England; [Leach, Richard] Univ Nottingham, Dept Mech Mat & Mfg Engn, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Klimkowska, A (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Geospatial Inst, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham NG7 2TU, England.",anna.klimkowska@nottingham.ac.uk; stefano.cavazzi@os.uk; richard.leach@nottingham.ac.uk; stephen.grebby@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2022,14,11,,,,,,,2579,10.3390/rs14112579,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14112579,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000809060900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A Positive Energy Building (PEB) model has been developed by the European Union as part of Horizon 2020 to contribute to a cleaner neighborhood environment. To achieve PEB goals, a variety of factors must be optimized, including occupant comfort, building efficiency, economic benefits, and clean energy provision. Building modeling simulation combined with data-driven tools such as machine learning and artificial intelligence can be used to predict energy production and optimize passive and active systems. Based on these findings, this study evaluates studies from the past decade that include data-driven approaches, which accelerate different aspects of PEB, including supply and demand. These aspects include renewable energy supply prediction with the local context, optimizing comfort control with IoT, and reducing demand by optimizing building envelope design, materials selection, and active systems. While there are a few surveys regarding renewable energy management and energy efficiency in buildings, none simultaneously classified the algorithms in a PEB framework. Hence, this work inherently creates a technical framework for future researchers and building engineers to apply the appropriate data-driven approach for achieving net positive energy performance in residential, educational, and commercial buildings. Finally, comparing different applications suggests future research problems that can be addressed by integrating optimization algorithms and machine learning approaches, as well as data gaps that can be resolved to improve prediction accuracy.","[Mousavi, SeyedehNiloufar; Villarreal-Marroquin, Maria Guadalupe; Smith, Neale R.] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Ave Eugenio Garza Sada 2501, Monterrey 64849, NL, Mexico; [Hajiaghaei-Keshteli, Mostafa] Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Puebla, Mexico",Tecnologico de Monterrey; Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Villarreal-Marroquín, MG (corresponding author), Tecnol Monterrey, Escuela Ingn & Ciencias, Ave Eugenio Garza Sada 2501, Monterrey 64849, NL, Mexico.",,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,Aug.15,2023,242,,,,,,,,110578,10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110578,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110578,,Jul.23,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:001036832400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The bibliometric analysis of 364 academic papers shows that smart building is a burgeoning, interdisciplinary field with a relatively high international collaboration level. Keyword's clustering identified two major themes: (1) IoT, WSN, and cloud computing for automation control and (2) the balance between energy efficiency and human comfort based on continuous monitoring and machine learning. The content analysis statistically detected a transition from the cyber-physical system (CPS) to the human-cyberphysical system (HCPS) in smart building research. We therefore proposed an HCPS framework with three dimensions-cyber-physical scale, human needs, and human roles-to summarize current research and discover potential gaps. Under this framework, five HCPS future research directions for occupants-centered smart buildings were proposed: adaptive building envelope, integrated building management system, enhanced building energy management, adaptive thermal comfort, and microgrid adoption.","[Li, Peixian; Lu, Yujie; Xiao, Jianzhuang; Wu, Huicang] Tongji Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Room A319,1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yujie; Xiao, Jianzhuang] Tongji Univ, Key Lab Performance Evolut & Control Engn Struct, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yujie] Tongji Univ, Shanghai Inst Intelligent Sci & Technol, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Yan, Da] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Architecture, Bldg Energy Res Ctr, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Tongji University; Tongji University; Tongji University; Tsinghua University,"Lu, YJ (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Room A319,1239 Siping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",Lu6@tongji.edu.cn,,,,,,,,20,21,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2021,129,,,,,,,,103776,10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103776,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103776,,Jun.21,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,16.01.2024,WOS:000740433900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

To regulators, a preventive approach based on a mandatory periodic facade inspection has been deemed as a necessary measure to maintain the functionality and integrity of the facade of tall buildings. Researchers worldwide have been working towards a predictive approach to allow for the assessment of the likely failure during some future period, by measuring the condition of the facade to detect latent defects and anomalies. The methods proposed include laser scanning, image-based sensing and infrared thermography to support the automatic facade visual inspection. This paper aims to review and analyse the state-of-the-art literature on the automated inspection of building facades, with emphasis on the detection and maintenance management of latent defects and anomalies for falling objects from tall buildings. A step-by-step holistic method is leveraged to retrieve the available literature from databases, followed by the analyses of relevant articles in different long-standing research themes. The types and characteristics of facade falling objects, legislations, practices and the effectiveness of various inspection techniques are discussed. Various diagnostic, inspection and analytical methods which support facade inspection and maintenance are analysed with discussion on the potential future research in this field.","[Chew, Michael Y.
