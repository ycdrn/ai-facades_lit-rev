This study aims to determine the best strategy for the envelope by examining the engineering design of the building in Nanchang University. The building shape coefficient, sun-shading strategies, window wall ratio, roof, and walls were studied through a method involving multilayer feed-forward neural network model simulations. Results show that the optimum shape coefficient value is 0.32. The combination of interior and exterior blinds and electrochromic glass is the ideal option to reduce the increase in the energy consumption of the architecture caused by solar radiation. Maintaining the window wall ratio at 0.4 is ideal. A green roof exerts a minimal effect on building energy consumption decrease (only 0.4%). Applying the strategy of vertical greening to the external wall can reduce cooling energy consumption by as much as 5.4%. Adopting the best envelope strategy combination can further decrease energy consumption by 20.8%. This strategy is also applicable to the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River in China, which flow through Nanchang and have a climate similar to that of the said area. Future research should be directed toward applying artificial neural networks to quantitatively evaluate the effects of a design strategy and produce the best design strategy combination.","[Chen, Qiquan; Weng, Ji] Chongqing Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Corcoran, Stephen] Univ Manchester, Sch John Dalton Bldg, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Fan, Chenhao] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Naval Architecture Ocean & Civil Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Chongqing University; University of Manchester; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Chen, QQ (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",1476398169@qq.com,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2016,41,3,,,,,32,37,,,,,,,Architecture; Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000390327100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

In Building Information Modeling (BIM) studies, the detection of building facade elements has an important role. BIM is a tool that allows maintaining a digital representation of all aspects of building information; therefore, it will enable the storage of almost any data related to a given structure, regarding its geometric and non-geometric aspects. Facade segmentation was first studied in the 1970s using hand-crafted expertise. Later, detection and segmentation studies emerged based on shapes of objects and parametric rules. With the developing technology, deep learning approaches in object detection studies have intensified. It is obvious that the desired analyses can be performed faster with deep learning approaches. However, deep learning methods require large training data. Algorithms that consider different situations and are suitable for real-world scenarios continue to be developed. The need in this direction continues in the literature. In this study, door and window detection was carried out with deep learning on an original data set. The algorithms used are YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, and Faster R-CNN. Precision, recall and mean average precision (mAP) are used as evaluation metrics. As a result of the study, precision, recall, and mAP values with YOLOv5 were obtained as 0.85, 0.72, and 0.79, respectively. With Faster R-CNN with the lowest performance, precision, recall, and mAP were obtained as 0.54, 0.63, and 0.54, respectively.","[Sezen, G.; Cakir, M.; Atik, M.

ML was used to assess the moisture durability of a building enclosure design and simplify the design process. This work used ML to predict the mold index and maximum moisture content of layers in typical residential wall constructions. Results show that ML, within the constraints of the construction, including exposure conditions, does an excellent job in predicting performance compared to hygrothermal simulations with a coefficient of determination, R-2, over 0.90.

The methods proposed include laser scanning, image-based sensing and infrared thermography to support the automatic facade visual inspection. This paper aims to review and analyse the state-of-the-art literature on the automated inspection of building facades, with emphasis on the detection and maintenance management of latent defects and anomalies for falling objects from tall buildings. A step-by-step holistic method is leveraged to retrieve the available literature from databases, followed by the analyses of relevant articles in different long-standing research themes.

The data contains substantial information that is essential in identifying building retrofit needs. Although the data capturing system is able to collect data in a highly-efficient manner, the data analysis is still a big data challenge to apply the system into delivering building retrofit plans.

To enhance the energy efficiency of buildings, this paper proposes an approach to predict building energy consumption based on the design of the building envelope. The design parameters of the building envelope include the comprehensive heat transfer coefficient and solar radiation absorption coefficient of exterior walls, comprehensive heat transfer coefficient and solar radiation absorption coefficient of the roof, comprehensive heat transfer coefficient of outer windows, and window-wall ratio. The approach is applied to optimize the design parameters of the building envelope structure of a university teaching building in northern China. First, a building information model of a teaching building is established in Revit and imported into DesignBuilder energy consumption analysis software. Subsequently, a data set of the abovementioned 6 parameters is obtained by performing orthogonal testing and energy consumption simulations. On this basis, an RF model is used to predict building energy consumption and rank the importance of each parameter, and the Pearson function is used to evaluate the corresponding correlations. The results show that the most important parameters with the highest correlations to building energy consumption are the comprehensive heat transfer coefficients of the exterior walls and outer windows and the window-wall ratio. Finally, the RF prediction results are compared to the prediction results of a BP artificial neural network (BP-ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The findings indicate that the RF model exhibits notable advantages in building energy consumption prediction and is the optimal prediction model among the compared models.

Outdoor image processing becomes difficult in typical European metropolitan situations due to dynamically changing weather conditions as well as various objects obscuring perspectives (wires, overhangs, posts, other building parts, etc.), therefore, we also investigated the influence of such ambient noise. The approach was tested on 8768 UAV photographs shot at different angles and aimed at very different 611 buildings in the city of Vilnius (Wilno).

First, this study presents a point cloud projection algorithm with high-accuracy orientation parameters from the position and orientation system (POS) of MLS that can convert large volumes of point cloud data to a raster image. Second, this study proposes a feature extraction approach based on morphological filtering with point cloud projection that can obtain building facade features in an image space. Third, this study designs an inverse transformation of point cloud projection to convert building facade features from an image space to a 3D space. A building facade feature with restricted facade plane detection algorithm is implemented to reconstruct facade pieces for street view service. The results of building facade extraction experiments with large volumes of point cloud from MLS show that the proposed approach is suitable for various types of building facade extraction. The geometric accuracy of building facades is 0.66 m in x direction, 0.64 in y direction and 0.55 m in the vertical direction, which is the same level as the space resolution (0.5 m) of the point cloud.","[Li, Yan] Changan Univ, Sch Informat Engn, Xian 710064, Peoples R China; [Hu, Qingwu] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Wu, Meng] Xian Res Inst Surveying & Mapping, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jianming] Shandong Prov Inst Land Surveying & Mapping, Jinan 250013, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xuan] China Railway SIYUAN Survey & Design Grp Co Ltd, Wuhan 430063, Peoples R China",Chang'an University; Wuhan University,"Hu, QW (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.",xaliyan72@163.com; huqw@whu.edu.cn; wumeng@163.com; feitianv4@163.com; wuxuanwhu@163.com,,,,,,,,18,18,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2016,5,12,,,,,,,231,10.3390/ijgi5120231,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi5120231,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000392493200013,View Full Record in Web of Science

We obtained the dominant colors of building facades in Changning District, Shanghai, utilizing Baidu street view images, image semantic segmentation technology and the K-means algorithm. The variations in building facades' dominant colors, color harmony and diversity across different types of functional streets were examined through logistic regression and ANOVA analyses. The results indicate that, compared to industrial streets, red hues are more common in science education streets, residential streets and mixed functional streets. Business streets are more likely to have hues of green, red and red-purple. Residential streets' saturation is overall higher than that of industrial streets. In business streets, the medium-high value occurs less frequently than other streets. Moreover, we found that the street building facade colors in industrial streets were more harmonious and less diversified than that in other functional streets. This study has implications for urban color planning practices. Color harmony and color diversity should be well considered in future planning. The role of street functions should also be addressed in building facade color planning, to improve existing planning frameworks as well as related strategies.","[Zhai, Yujia; Gong, Ruoyu; Huo, Junzi; Fan, Binbin] Tongji Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China",Tongji University,"Zhai, YJ (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",zhai@tongji.edu.cn,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2023,12,6,,,,,,,224,10.3390/ijgi12060224,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi12060224,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001014873300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, existing methods for parsing building facades based on semantic segmentation have difficulties in distinguishing individual instances of connected buildings. Manually collecting and annotating instances of building facades in large datasets is time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the recent development and use of city digital twins (CDTs), massive high-quality digital assets of buildings have been created. These assets make it possible to generate high-quality and cost-effective synthetic datasets that can replace real-world ones as training sets for the supervised learning-based instance segmentation of building facades. In this study, we developed a novel framework that can automatically produce synthetic datasets from a CDT. An auto-generation system for synthetic street views was built by rendering city digital assets in a game engine, while the system auto-generated the instance annotations for building facades. The hybrid dataset HSRBFIA, along with various subsets containing different proportions of synthetic and real data, were used to train deep learning models for facade instance segmentation. In our experiments, two types of synthetic data (CDT-based and virtual-based) were compared, and the results showed that the CDT synthetic data were more effective in boosting deep learning training with real-world images compared with the virtual synthetic data (no real-world counterparts). By swapping a certain portion of the real data with the proposed CDT synthetic images, the performance could almost match what is achievable when using the real-world training set.","[Zhang, Jiaxin; Fukuda, Tomohiro; Yabuki, Nobuyoshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Div Sustainable Energy & Environm Engn, 2-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan",Osaka University,"Fukuda, T (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Div Sustainable Energy & Environm Engn, 2-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",fukuda.tomohiro.see.eng@osaka-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 21,2022,9,5,,,,,1737,1755,,10.1093/jcde/qwac086,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jcde/qwac086,,,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Multidisciplinary",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000863747100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Furthermore, to maximize the effect, we employ a machine learning (ML)-based operation and evaluate its efficiency. A parametric study is conducted based on a standard office model in Japan using the DesignBuilder software. The result shows that the heating and cooling loads reduces by 17.1% compared with low-E glazing in warm climates (Miyazaki, Zone 7). However, in cold climates (Obihiro, Zone 2), the energy increase is 25.4% and the trend of the effect changes near Zone 4.

In this work, we re-purpose well known deep neural network architectures in the fields of image segmentation and single image depth prediction, for the tasks of facade structural element detection, depth point-cloud generation and protrusion estimation, with the goal of alleviating drawbacks in our previous design, resulting in a more light-weight, robust, flexible and cost-effective design.","[Bacharidis, Konstantinos] Univ Crete, Dept Comp Sci, Iraklion 70013, Greece; [Bacharidis, Konstantinos] Fdn Res & Technol Hellas FORTH, Iraklion 70013, Greece; [Sarri, Froso] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Khania 73100, Greece; [Ragia, Lemonia] ATHENA Res & Innovat Informat Technol, Maroussi 15125, Greece",University of Crete; Technical University of Crete,"Ragia, L (corresponding author), ATHENA Res & Innovat Informat Technol, Maroussi 15125, Greece.",kbacharidis@csd.uoc.gr; esarri@isc.tuc.gr; leragia@athenarc.gr,,,,,,,,13,13,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2020,9,5,,,,,,,322,10.3390/ijgi9050322,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9050322,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000541105200019,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents methods for robust mould reliability analysis and identification of critical parameters. Mould indices are calculated by probabilistic hygrothermal analysis, followed by the application of the Finnish mould growth model. To increase the robustness of the mould growth analysis, a random forests metamodel is first trained on the dataset and then used to expand the number of simulations. Finally, the reliability is calculated based on the probability of exceeding a given maximum mould index limit state. Critical parameters are identified through a sensitivity analysis based on linear and non-linear dependencies between inputs and maximum mould index. The methods are demonstrated by analysing three external wall assemblies. In conclusion, the mould reliability analysis method helps to assess the robustness of the hygrothermal analysis and mould assessment by investigating the influence of hygrothermal variables' uncertainties on the maximum mould index. By combining a metamodel with probabilistic analysis, it is possible to significantly reduce the amount of time required to evaluate a large number of scenarios.","[Pour, Mohsen Bayat; Niklewski, Jonas; Hansson, Eva Fruhwald] Lund Univ, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, Div Struct Engn, John Ericssons vag 1, SE-22363 Lund, Sweden; [Naghibi, Amir] Lund Univ, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, Div Water Resources Engn, John Ericssons Vag 1, SE-22363 Lund, Sweden",Ericsson; Lund University; Lund University; Ericsson,"Pour, MB (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, Div Struct Engn, John Ericssons vag 1, SE-22363 Lund, Sweden.",mohsen.bayat_pour@kstr.lth.se; jonas.niklewski@kstr.lth.se; amir.naghibi@tvrl.lth.se; eva.fruhwald_hansson@kstr.lth.se,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 1,2023,243,,,,,,,,110703,10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110703,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110703,,AUG 2023,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001063288800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The newly developed model includes three main components: a simulation model, a predictive model, and an optimization model. The simulation model simulates the building's energy performance, considering different values for various envelope parameters. The predictive model employs machine learning algorithms, including RF, ANN, DNN, SVM, GENLIN, and GB (in which GB has been identified as the most suitable algorithm), boasting a very high R2(0.994) to assess energy consumption. The optimization model which uses AI optimization algorithms (such as NSGA II, DSE, and MOPSO) integrates the machine learning predictive model into the evaluation function during the evolutionary process, efficiently searching for Pareto-optimal building envelope solutions. Results show simultaneous savings in cost and energy, with savings of 7.52 % in cost and 8.48 % in energy, or 21.17 % in cost and 0.4 % in energy, for a case study in Vietnam.

In contrast to roof surfaces, facades can not directly be reconstructed in a similar high level of quality from this data. Distortions of perspective might appear in images, due to the camera angle. Occlusions and shadowing occur as well. Objects, such as windows and doors, will have to be detected on such data if facades are to be reconstructed. Although one can use inpainting techniques to cover occluded areas, detection results are often incomplete and noisy. Formal grammars can then be used to align and add objects. However, it is difficult to find suitable rules for all types of buildings. We propose a post-processing approach based on neural networks to improve facade layouts. To this end, we applied existing Recurrent Neural Network architectures like Multi-Dimensional Long Short-term Memory Network and Quasi Recurrent Neural Network in a new context. We also propose a novel architecture, the Rotated Multi-Dimensional Long Short Term Memory. In order to deal with two-dimensional neighborhoods this architecture combines four two-dimensional Multi-Dimensional Long Short-term Memory Networks on rotated images.

However, the previous object removal typically requires a user to manually create a mask around unwanted objects and obtain background facade information in advance, which would be labor-intensive when implementing multitasking projects. Moreover, accurately detecting objects to be removed in the cityscape and inpainting the static obstructed building facade to obtain plausible images are the main challenges for this objective. To overcome these difficulties, this study addresses the object removal with the facade inpainting problem from the following two aspects. First, we proposed an image-based cityscape elimination method for automatic object removal and facade inpainting by applying semantic segmentation to detect several classes, including pedestrians, riders, vegetation, and cars, as well as using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for filling detected regions by background textures and patching information from street-level imagery. Second, we proposed a workflow to filter unoccluded building facades from street view images automatically and tailored a dataset for the GAN-based image inpainting model with original and mask images. Furthermore, several full-reference image quality assessment (IQA) metrics are introduced to evaluate the generated image quality. Validation results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed method, and the synthetic image is visually realistic and semantically consistent.","[Zhang, Jiaxin; Fukuda, Tomohiro; Yabuki, Nobuyoshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Div Sustainable Energy & Environm Engn, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan",Osaka University,"Fukuda, T (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Div Sustainable Energy & Environm Engn, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",fukuda@see.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,9,,,,,,117486,117495,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3106124,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3106124,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000690431800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper proposes a domain knowledge-informed, finite element-based machine learning framework to reduce the computation cost for the energy management of buildings installed with TABE that uses a ground thermal loop. First, the training heat flux data set was generated by FEM simulations with different thermal loop schedules. Then, both shallow learning models (i.e., multivariate linear regression and eXtreme Gradient Boost, or XGBoost) and a deep learning model (i.e., deep neural network, or DNN) were trained to predict the heat fluxes. Domain knowledge was used for data preprocessing and feature selection. Finally, the suitability of the selected machine learning model was tested under different thermal loop schedules. The case study results showed that: (1) XGBoost can be as accurate as DNN (coefficient of determination equal to 0.81) with much less training time; (2) the annual energy cost savings for different thermal loop schedules obtained by the XGBoost-predicted and FEMcalculated heat fluxes are consistent, having a difference of only 4%; and (3) XGBoost can reduce the computation time for the annual energy analysis of the case study building with a given thermal loop schedule from around 12 h by using FEM to less than 1 min.","[Shen, Zhenglai; Shrestha, Som; Howard, Daniel; Hun, Diana] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Bldg & Transportat Sci Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Feng, Tianli] Univ Utah, Dept Mech Engn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [She, Buxin] Univ Tennessee, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Shrestha, Som] Bethel Valley Rd,POB 2008 MS-6070, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Shrestha, S (corresponding author), Bethel Valley Rd,POB 2008 MS-6070, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",shresthass@ornl.gov,,,,,,,,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,APR 15,2023,234,,,,,,,,110157,10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110157,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110157,,MAR 2023,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000962760000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Various shading control strategies had been proposed and compared in existing literature, but their energy performance can be further improved with a more comprehensive consideration of environmental changes and indoor demand. This study develops and validates an adaptive predictive control (APC) model for roller shades that combines simulation-based optimization of shading control with machine learning. The model predicts the appropriate position of roller shades based on multiple environmental parameters, minimizing the building energy demand. EnergyPlus and Python provide continuous energy simulation and data processing. Using pre-simulated datasets, machine learning algorithms develop APC models.

However, in the early design stages, when the envelope shape is defined, energy performance information is normally nonexistent, due to modeling for energy simulation being a time-consuming task, frequently overlooked at this phase. This paper presents a methodology to assist design decisions regarding the building envelope shape considering its implications on energy performance. Basically, this methodology involves a flexible design system, to generate alternative envelope shape designs, with integrated energy simulation, to calculate the energy demand of each design. Shape grammars are particularly suitable to encode architectural design systems, given their ability to encode compositional design principles. Their downside is the complexity in developing computer implementations. This methodology converts a grammar into a parametric design system and is illustrated with an application to the grammar for Frank Lloyd Wright's prairie houses. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM.

The existing grammar-based approaches for facade parsing rely on strong prior knowledge but can obtain facade parts with better structure. Pixelwise-segmentation-based approaches achieve facade parsing with much less knowledge but the resulting structure of facade parts is normally incomplete. Both these approaches are restricted by their high reliance on the data set. Therefore, they cannot be applied for facade parsing with complex scenes. To address this issue, we built a large street-level data set by taking Mapillary images as the training data for more general scenes. At the same time, we propose a new pipeline based on convolutional neural network (CNN) that combines pixelwise segmentation and global object detection to achieve better results for facade parsing. Our pipeline can be applied to facade images after rectification and street-level facade images with complex scenes. The result of the ablation study demonstrates that the design of our pipeline is effective. We test our pipeline on the classic ECP2011 data set and our new large street-level data set. Our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results for both the data sets: an accuracy of 98.2% and the mean average precision (mAP) of 98.8% on the ECP2011 data set as well as the mAP of 81.1% for facade parts parsing on our street-level data set.","[Kong, Gefei] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Fan, Hongchao] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Wuhan University; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Fan, HC (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",gefeikong@whu.edu.cn; hongchao.fan@ntnu.no,,,,,,,,10,10,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2021,59,12,,,,,10519,10531,,10.1109/TGRS.2020.3035878,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2020.3035878,,,,"Geochemistry & Geophysics; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000722170500054,View Full Record in Web of Science

The traditional time-length-velocity (TVL) approach is severely dependent on the determination of the TVL factors and the selection of single-point measurement tap. To overcome the difficulties, this study aims to generate a generalized model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to reconstruct the super-resolution pressure distributions from low-resolution pressure measurements at different wind directions. The constraint represented by the pressure gradient are embedded in the loss function of the CNN to enable the model to generate real pressure distribution characteristics. By spatially averaging the super-resolution distri-butions, the peak space-averaged pressure on the glazed panels could be finally predicted. On the basis of a rectangle-section high-rise building, the regions near the top corner and near the middle-height under different wind directions are focused on. Results show that the pressure peaks computed from the super-resolution distributions can provide more accurate and robust representations for the true area-averaged peaks, compared with the traditional TVL method.

The goal is to use the technical advantages of the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) in image generation and style transfer to create a method for independently designing a specific facade decoration style by interpreting image data of historical district facades. The research in this paper is based on the historical district of Putian in Fujian Province and facilitates an experiment of image data acquisition, image processing and screening, model training, image generation, and style matching of the target area. The research found the following: (1) CGAN technology can better identify and generate the decorative style of historical districts. It can realize the overall or partial scheme design of the facade. (2) In terms of adaptability, this method can provide a better scheme reference for historical district reconstruction, facade renovation, and renovation design projects. Especially for districts with obvious decorative styles, the visualization effect is better. In addition, it also has certain reference significance for the determination and design of the facade decoration style of a specific historical building. (3) Lastly, this method can better learn the internal laws of the complex district style and form to generate a new design with a clear decoration style attribute.

As buildings exhibit an array of textures and geometric forms, the process of image acquisition is easily affected, although the robustness of texture in scenes (e.g., dilapidated buildings) is poor, with high point cloud data, and low recognition efficiency; therefore, the accuracy of building element extraction based on a single data source remains limited. In this research, a method for building facade element extraction based on multidimensional virtual semantic feature map ensemble learning and hierarchical clustering is proposed. Point clouds were obtained by multi-view images, and then the multidimensional virtual semantic feature maps, including color, texture, orientation, and curvature semantics, were acquired via reprojection. The multi-semantic feature block pre-segmentation, considering multiple features, was obtained by ensemble learning, and a hierarchical clustering strategy was established for to achieve fine extraction of building facade elements. Experiments were conducted across multiple building types, and the results showed that: 1) The method can use different virtual semantic feature map and clustering strategies to achieve accurate extraction of diverse building facade elements; 2) The method achieved joint learning tasks in both 2D and 3D space; and, 3) The proposed method achieved fine extraction of building elements with pixel accuracy (PA) over 70% in all experiments and mean intersection over union (mIoU) up to 95%, which were better than the image based method. In summary, this method offers a novel, more reliable method for segmenting and extracting building facade elements, which has important theoretical and practical significance.","[Zhang, Rongchun; He, Yiting; Yang, Lijun] Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Geog & Biol Informat, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Liang] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Oceam Sci, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Yi, Xuefeng] Hohai Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Nanjing 211100, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Rongchun; Lu, Guanming] Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Commun & Informat Engn, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Nanjing University; Hohai University; Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications,"Cheng, L (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Oceam Sci, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.",rongchunzhang@njupt.edu.cn; 1020173003@njupt.edu.cn; lcheng@nju.edu.cn; hhuyxf@sina.com; lugm@njupt.edu.cn; Ljyang@njupt.edu.cn,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2022,114,,,,,,,,103068,10.1016/j.jag.2022.103068,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2022.103068,,NOV 2022,,Remote Sensing,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000972463300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we solve facade parsing with occlusions by progressive feature learning. To this end, we locate the regions contaminated by occlusions via Bayesian uncertainty evaluation on categorizing each pixel in these regions. Then, guided by the uncertainty, we propose an occlusion-immune facade parsing architecture in which we progressively re-express the features of pixels in each contaminated region from easy to hard. Specifically, the outside pixels, which have reliable context from visible areas, are re-expressed at early stages; the inner pixels are processed at late stages when their surroundings have been decontaminated at the earlier stages. In addition, at each stage, instead of using regular square convolution kernels, we design a context enhancement module (CEM) with directional strip kernels, which can aggregate structural context to re-express facade pixels. Extensive experiments on popular facade datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.","[Ma, Wenguang; Ma, Wei] Beijing Univ Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China; [Xu, Shibiao] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaopeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, Natl Lab Pattern Recognit, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Zha, Hongbin] Peking Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Key Lab Machine Percept MOE, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Beijing University of Technology; Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Automation, CAS; Peking University","Ma, W (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China.",mawenguang@emails.bjut.edu.cn; shibiaoxu@bupt.edu.cn; mawei@bjut.edu.cn; xiaopeng.zhang@ia.ac.cn; zha@cis.pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,,2022,31,,,,,,2081,2093,,10.1109/TIP.2022.3152004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2022.3152004,,,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000766266400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A Bayesian network is developed, considering three levels of variables: characteristics of the building, facade and exposure conditions; causes of defects; and defects. To compute conditional probabilities, the results of an inspection campaign from the literature are used. Then, the proposed model is validated and verified using inspection results from another sample, the combination of a strength-of-influence diagram and sensitivity analysis and the application of the model to a case study. Results show that the probabilities computed by the model are a reasonable representation of the hesitancy in decision making during the diagnosis process based only on visual observation. For instance, design and execution errors show lower probabilities due to not being verifiable a posteriori without detailed documentation.

Our classifier first identifies the images containing buildings, then separates individual facades within an image and determines the building style.

The algorithm was benchmarked against synthetic data and calculated the volume of common solids with approximately 30% uncertainty. The relationship between volume and heat release rate was then calibrated from videos of burners at known heat release rates. These experiments were used to calculate the Orloff-DeRis constant c, which linearly relates flame volume and heat release rate. The value for c was found to be 1505 +/- 183 kW/m(3).

Social and economical change is predicted by numerous company leaders, politicians and researchers. Machine and Deep Learning (ML/DL) are sub-types of AI, which are gaining high interest within the community of data scientists and engineers worldwide. Obviously, this global trend does not stop at structural glass engineering, so that, the first part of the present paper is concerned with introducing the basic theoretical frame of AI and its sub-classes of ML and DL while the specific needs and requirements for the application in a structural engineering context are highlighted. Then this paper explores potential applications of AI for different subjects within the design, verification and monitoring of facades and glass structures. Finally, the current status of research as well as successfully conducted industry projects by the authors are presented. The discussion of specific problems ranges from supervised ML in case of the material parameter identification of polymeric interlayers used in laminated glass or the prediction of cut-edge strength based on the process parameters of a glass cutting machine and prediction of fracture patterns of tempered glass to the application of computer vision DL methods to image classification of the Pummel test and the use of semantic segmentation for the detection of cracks at the cut edge of glass. In the summary and conclusion section, the main findings for the applicability and impact of AI for the presented structural glass research and industry problems are compiled. It can be seen that in many cases AI, data, software and computing resources are already available today to successfully implement AI projects in the glass industry, which is demonstrated by the many current examples mentioned. Future research directories however will need to concentrate on how to introduce further glass-specific theoretical and human expert knowledge in the AI training process on the one hand and on the other hand more pronunciation has to be laid on the thorough digitization of workflows associated with the structural glass problem at hand in order to foster the further use of AI within this domain in both research and industry.","[Kraus, M.

Review papers on these methods, applied in situ and in laboratory, have been published, focusing on theory, equipment, metrological performance, test conditions and data acquisition, data analysis, benefits, and limitations. However, steps forward have been done and not been deepened in previous works: in fact, the representative points method and the weighted area method have been proposed, too, whilst artificial intelligence and data-driven methods have begun to prove the reliability also in the U-value prevision using available datasets. Considering this context, this work aims at updating the literature background considering exclusively in situ methods. The work starts from bibliometric and scientometric analysis not previously conducted: this helped to group the methods and to sketch the innovations and the future perspectives. Indeed, from the bibliometric and scientometric literature analysis what emerged was (i) the richness of the background on this topic, especially in the recent years, (ii) two macro-groups (methods with and without measurements), and (iii) the importance of paper keywords (otherwise, interesting papers are eluded by the output of simple database queries). The method study that followed aims at providing (i) a broader view of the thermal transmittance (U-value) assessment procedures, including the utmost recent applications, proposal, and outlooks in this field, (ii) the understanding on the fundamental theories of the techniques, (iii) practical advice for building-envelope assessment, focusing on the advantages and limitations useful for professionals and researchers involved in the energy audit, conservation, or refurbishment of building stock, (iv) the identification of the interconnection between the techniques that often rely on one another, and (v) final remarks and future perspective of the procedures, which embrace the use of artificial intelligence (AI). From the topic analysis, as a result, it emerged that this is an open field for future research, especially with the implementation of AI, which requires good datasets and trials on the models' architectures, in terms of input layer, number of hidden layer and neurons, and percentage of data to be employed for model training and testing.","[Nardi, Iole] ENEA Casaccia Res Ctr, I-00123 Rome, Italy; [Lucchi, Elena] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture, Built Environm & Construction Engn DABC, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Lucchi, E (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture, Built Environm & Construction Engn DABC, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",iole.nardi@enea.it; elena.lucchi@polimi.it,,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2023,16,8,,,,,,,3319,10.3390/en16083319,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16083319,,,,Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000977126100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Their reconstruction and representation as three-dimensional city models have attracted the attention of many researchers and industry specialists, as they increasingly recognise the potential for new applications requiring detailed building models. Nevertheless, despite being investigated for a few decades, the comprehensive reconstruction of buildings remains a challenging task. While there is a considerable body of literature on this topic, including several systematic reviews summarising ways of acquiring and reconstructing coarse building structures, there is a paucity of in-depth research on the detection and reconstruction of facade openings (i.e., windows and doors). In this review, we provide an overview of emerging applications, data acquisition and processing techniques for building facade reconstruction, emphasising building opening detection. The use of traditional technologies from terrestrial and aerial platforms, along with emerging approaches, such as mobile phones and volunteered geography information, is discussed. The current status of approaches for opening detection is then examined in detail, separated into methods for three-dimensional and two-dimensional data. Based on the review, it is clear that a key limitation associated with facade reconstruction is process automation and the need for user intervention. Another limitation is the incompleteness of the data due to occlusion, which can be reduced by data fusion. In addition, the lack of available diverse benchmark datasets and further investigation into deep-learning methods for facade openings extraction present crucial opportunities for future research.","[Klimkowska, Anna; Grebby, Stephen] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Geospatial Inst, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham NG7 2TU, England; [Cavazzi, Stefano] Ordnance Survey, Adanac Dr, Southampton SO16 0AS, Hants, England; [Leach, Richard] Univ Nottingham, Dept Mech Mat & Mfg Engn, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Klimkowska, A (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Geospatial Inst, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham NG7 2TU, England.",anna.klimkowska@nottingham.ac.uk; stefano.cavazzi@os.uk; richard.leach@nottingham.ac.uk; stephen.grebby@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2022,14,11,,,,,,,2579,10.3390/rs14112579,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14112579,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000809060900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, current applications still face the challenges of low accuracy and lack of automation. In this article we propose a new two-steps workflow for window segmentation and vectorization from facade images. First, we propose a cross field learning-based neural network architecture, which is augmented by a grid-based self-attention module for window segmentation from rectified facade images, resulting in pixel-wise window blobs. Second, we propose a regression neural network augmented by squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention blocks for window vectorization. The network takes the segmentation results together with the original facade image as input, and directly outputs the position of window corners, resulting in vectorized window objects with improved accuracy. In order to validate the effectiveness of our method, experiments are carried out on four public facades image datasets, with results usually yielding a higher accuracy for the final window prediction in comparison to baseline methods on four datasets in terms of intersection over union score, F1 score, and pixel accuracy.","[Zhuo, Xiangyu; Tian, Jiaojiao] German Aerosp Ctr, Inst Remote Sensing, D-82205 Wessling, Germany; [Fraundorfer, Friedrich] Graz Univ Technol, Inst Comp Graph & Vis, A-8010 Graz, Austria",Helmholtz Association; German Aerospace Centre (DLR); Graz University of Technology,"Zhuo, XY; Tian, JJ (corresponding author), German Aerosp Ctr, Inst Remote Sensing, D-82205 Wessling, Germany.;Fraundorfer, F (corresponding author), Graz Univ Technol, Inst Comp Graph & Vis, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",xiangyu.zhuo@dlr.de; jiaojiao.tian@dlr.de; fraundorfer@icg.tugraz.at,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2023,16,,,,,,431,448,,10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3218767,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2022.3218767,,,,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000900007800010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Circa 28% of this energy demand is attributed to space heating and cooling, primarily influenced by the building's envelope and need to ensure indoor thermal comfort. Given this significant energy consumption, there is an urgent imperative to explore energy-saving strategies and develop tools to assess the effects of various design alternatives, with a focus on wall and roof characteristics. While existing white and black-box predictive models lack generalisation capabilities, the goal of this study is to develop and train a domain-informed grey-box Deep Learning model called Temp-AI -Estimator to predict the indoor temperature of buildings and containers (acting as surrogates for residential or office buildings as well as intermodal containers) based on measurements of external meteorological conditions (e.g. exterior temperature, humidity, etc.), as well as physical properties due to building construction set-ups in questions (ThermoProtect (thin coating), ThermoActive (thick coating) and thermal insulation). The major difficulty lies in making the model generalise beyond the three geographical locations included in the dataset (Berlin, Abu Dhabi, Texel). Experiments with LSTMs and Transformers as baseline models showed overfitting on the particular conditions at the sites in the training set, while failing to generalise to a new out-of-sample location. We propose to pass the model the numerical derivatives of the time-sequences, as these are less location-specific. The estimation of the necessary initial/final conditions is delegated to a very small network to minimise the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, we included a physically motivated module for modelling the latency and difference in amplitudes between exterior conditions and interior temperatures, informed by numerical approximation schemes of the differential equation of thermal conduction. Our experiments show that our domain-informed network achieves an increase in accuracy of almost 40% in addition to yielding results that can easily be inspected by human experts due to interpretability and explainability.","[Bischof, Rafael; Riedel, Henrik; Drass, Michael; Kraus, Michael A.] M&M Network Ing UG, Lennebergstr 40, D-55125 Mainz, Germany; [Sprenger, Marius; Walczok, Waldemar] SICC Coatings GmbH, Wackenbergstr 78-82, D-13156 Berlin, Germany; [Bumann, Matthias] dimagb, Wilhelminenhofstr 50, D-12459 Berlin, Germany",,"Kraus, MA (corresponding author), M&M Network Ing UG, Lennebergstr 40, D-55125 Mainz, Germany.",kraus@mm-network-ing.com,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 15,2023,297,,,,,,,,113425,10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113425,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113425,,AUG 2023,,"Construction & Building Technology; Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001055189500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To facilitate the installation of PV modules at solar abundant locations, an accurate estimation of solar PV spatial potential is indispensable. Solar energy could be reflected on high-albedo building surfaces inside the urban canyon. However, using conventional ways to construct albedo datasets for different building surfaces is extremely labor-intense. In this work, we proposed to use semantic segmentation to identify facade materials from street view images. Due to the distinguishable features between materials in terms of the subtle texture and patterns rather than just their shapes and colors, identification requires more details from images, which makes multi-scale inference structure a promising solution. Compared with existing methods combining scales features at pixel-level, we proposed a novel Multi-Scale Contextual Attention Network (MSCA), using a Multi-Scale Object-Contextual Representation (OCR) block to exploit and combine contextual information from different scales in high dimensional layers. The experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing models, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIOU) of 70.23%. The results indicate that the MSCA can effectively obtain the materials information from street views and can be a reliable solution to providing urban albedo information for solar estimation.","[Xu, Fan; Wong, Man Sing; Heo, Joon; Shi, Guoqiang] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hung Hom, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Rui] ASTAR, Inst High Performance Comp IHPC, 1 Fusionopolis Way, Singapore 138632, Singapore; [Heo, Joon] Yonsei Univ, Coll Engn, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 134 Shinchondong, Seoul 03722, South Korea",Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Agency for Science Technology & Research (A*STAR); A*STAR - Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC); Yonsei University,"Wong, MS (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hung Hom, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China.",fanfan.xu@connect.polyu.hk; ls.charles@polyu.edu.hk; zhur@ihpc.a-star.edu.sg; jheo@yonsei.ac.kr; guoqiang.shi@polyu.edu.hk,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2023,202,,,,,,158,168,,10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2023.06.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2023.06.001,,JUN 2023,,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001024036200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This work supports the premise that Solar Energy Density (SED) can be used as a benchmark to evaluate the dual performance of perforated screens (PS). Therefore, only irradiance calculations will be required in evaluations - instead of running three different simulations. Orthogonal Arrays and Principal Component Analysis were the statistical techniques used to select the PS sample and weight the simulation results. The resultant SED thresholds concurrently fostered the accomplishment of daylighting and energy goals, at five different orientations: they maximised the daylit area and minimised the overlit area and total energy use. This work also presents an application example of the single-metric approach to test its effectiveness to perform single-objective optimization of PS design by using Evolutionary Algorithms.

Adequate views to the outside are one of the most cited indoor qualities related to occupant well-being. However, due to urbanization and densification trends, designers may have difficulties in providing vistas and views to the outside with an assortment of content, which can support the needs of their occupants. To better understand occupant view satisfaction and provide reliable design feedback to architects, existing view satisfaction data must be expanded to capture a wider variety of view scenarios and occupants. Most related research remains challenging in architectural practice due to a lack of easy-to-use early design analysis tools. However, early assessment of view can be advantageous as design decisions in early design, such as building orientation, plan layout, and facade design, can improve the view quality. This paper, hence, presents results from a 181 participant view satisfaction survey with 590 window views. The survey data is used to train a tree-regression model to predict view satisfaction. The prediction performance was compared to an existing view assessment framework through case studies. The result showed that the new prediction (RMSE = 0.65) is more accurate to the surveyed result than the framework (RMSE = 3.78). Further, the prediction performance was generally high (R-2 >= 0.64) for most responses, verifying the reliability. To facilitate view analysis in early design, this paper describes integrating the satisfaction prediction model and a ray-casting tool to compute view parameters in the CAD environment.","[Kim, Jaeha; Kral, Katharina; Dogan, Timur] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Kent, Michael] Berkeley Educ Alliance Res Singapore, Singapore, Singapore",Cornell University,"Kim, J (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",jk2894@cornell.edu,,,,,,,,15,15,,,,,,,,,,,APR 15,2022,214,,,,,,,,108909,10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.108909,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.108909,,FEB 2022,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000779415900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although the artificial intelligence technology has made a breakthrough in image segmentation, it is nontrivial to directly apply standard deep learning approaches for building facade element detection. The main reason is that the existing semantic segmentation networks have a bad performance in predicting highly regularized shapes. This research develops a hieratical deep learning framework with a symmetric loss function to automatically detect building facade elements from images. The new framework contains two types of attention modules, namely, the spatial attention module, and the channel attention module. A new loss function is designed to integrate prior engineering knowledge, which can be used to force the detection of facade elements (e.g., windows, doors, concrete walls, and sunshades) to have a highly proportionate shape. The effectiveness of the developed approach is demonstrated in two public datasets. Experimental results indicate that the developed deep learning framework with a new loss function outperforms state-of-the-art models significantly, where the achieved a Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) on the Ecole Centrale Paris(ECP) dataset (81.9%) brings an improvement of 11.3% over Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and 4.0% over Deepfacade, respectively, and the achieved a Mean IoU on the ArtDeco dataset (85.6%) yields an improvement of 11.4% over FCN and 5.8% over Deepfacade, respectively. Moreover, the developed approach is more practical and effective to detect regularized facade elements, where the detection of the wall components has an IoU of 93.6% on the ECP dataset and 88.6% on the ArtDeco dataset, respectively. Overall, the contribution from the technical aspect is to develop a hieratical deep learning framework consisting of attention modules together with the newly designed loss function and the prior engineering knowledge. The contribution from the practical aspect is to realize the automatic and accurate detection for various building facade elements in complex environments, which can be potentially helpful for the infrastructure monitoring and maintenance operation.","[Zhang, Gaowei; Pan, Yue; Zhang, Limao] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Pan, Yue] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Shanghai Key Lab Digital Maintenance Bldg & Infra, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Zhang, LM (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",gwzhang@ntu.edu.sg; panyue001@sjtu.edu.cn; limao.zhang@ntu.edu.sg,,,,,,,,24,26,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2022,133,,,,,,,,104016,10.1016/j.autcon.2021.104016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2021.104016,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000787885200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Geometry optimization and adjustable devices are considered as effective ways to improve the energy performance of PVSDs. Previously proposed methods fail to evaluate the importance of the geometric parameters of PVSDs comprehensively, and the proposed dynamic control strategy for adjustable PVSDs cannot respond to real-time weather changes. Therefore, this paper proposes an optimal design method for PVSDs to maximize energy performance by an optimized geometry and the proposed adaptive control model (ACM). Compared with previous studies, the proposed method integrates the influence of geometric parameters on energy performance, and the ACM proposed is able to adjust the tilt angle of PVSDs instantaneously based on real-time weather data. Subsequently, an office in Guangzhou was used as a case study for the evaluation to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that by using the optimized PVSDs, the cooling and lighting demand of the office is reduced by up to 48.7%. They are completely covered by the generated power, along with an energy surplus of 1034.4 kWh per year.

The images were captured inside an architectural model aimed at exploring the impact of shading panels on photobiological lighting parameters. The architectural model represents a generic space at 1:10 scale with a single side fully glazing facade used to install shading panels. The datasets present interior lighting conditions under different shading configurations in terms of surface colors and glossiness, horizontal and vertical orientations and upwards, downwards, and left/right inclinations of panels, V-shape opening, low to high densities, and top and bottom positions at the window. The experiments of shading panel configurations were conducted under four to six different exterior overcast daylighting conditions simulated with very cool to very warm color temperatures and high to low intensities inside an artificial sky chamber. The datasets include bracketed low dynamic range (LDR) images which enable generating high dynamic range (HDR) images for photobiological lighting evaluations. Images were captured from the side and back viewpoints inside the model by using Raspberry Pi camera modules mounted with fisheye lenses. The datasets are reusable and useful for architects, lighting designers, and building engineers to study the impact of architectural variables and shading panels on photobiological lighting conditions in space. The datasets will also be interesting for computer vision specialists to run machine learning techniques and train artificial intelligence for architectural applications.

To automatically achieve visual evaluation of facade condition with high accuracy, current studies have applied various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to classify, localize, and segment the defects. However, the methods in previous research mainly focused on accuracy improvement rather than providing effective evaluations of defects according to the requirement of industry standards. Therefore, this study proposes a rule-based deep learning method to achieve evaluation-oriented facade defects detection, which can be used to provide effective evaluation areas containing the necessary information (e.g., type, location, quantity, and size of facade defects) for condition evaluation. First, annotation rules for classification, segmentation, and localization are designed to instruct the manual annotation work and automatically adjust the bounding boxes into effective evaluation areas. Then, a proposal weighting rule is developed to be combined with the deep learning model during the model training process to improve the accuracy and stability of the predictions. A rectification rule is further used to adjust the raw predictions into predictions with effective evaluation areas for facade defects. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrated that using the proposed method can successfully improve the performance of facade defects detection to meet the requirement of condition evaluation.

Due to the fact that these environments can grow even more over time, applications related to their monitoring tend to turn to autonomous intelligent systems, which together with remote sensing data could help or even predict daily life situations. The task of mapping cities by autonomous operators was usually carried out by aerial optical images due to its scale and resolution; however new scientific questions have arisen, and this has led research into a new era of highly-detailed data extraction. For many years, using artificial neural models to solve complex problems such as automatic image classification was commonplace, owing much of their popularity to their ability to adapt to complex situations without needing human intervention. In spite of that, their popularity declined in the mid-2000s, mostly due to the complex and time-consuming nature of their methods and workflows. However, newer neural network architectures have brought back the interest in their application for autonomous classifiers, especially for image classification purposes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been a trend for pixel-wise image segmentation, showing flexibility when detecting and classifying any kind of object, even in situations where humans failed to perceive differences, such as in city scenarios. In this paper, we aim to explore and experiment with state-of-the-art technologies to semantically label 3D urban models over complex scenarios. To achieve these goals, we split the problem into two main processing lines: first, how to correctly label the facade features in the 2D domain, where a supervised CNN is used to segment ground-based facade images into six feature classes, roof, window, wall, door, balcony and shop; second, a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) workflow is used to extract the geometry of the facade, wherein the segmented images in the previous stage are then used to label the generated mesh by a reverse ray-tracing technique. This paper demonstrates that the proposed methodology is robust in complex scenarios. The facade feature inferences have reached up to 93% accuracy over most of the datasets used. Although it still presents some deficiencies in unknown architectural styles and needs some improvements to be made regarding 3D-labeling, we present a consistent and simple methodology to handle the problem.","[Lotte, Rodolfo Georjute; de Aragao, Luiz Eduardo Oliveira e Cruz; Shimabukuro, Yosio Edemir] Natl Inst Space Res, Remote Sensing Div, Av Astronautas 1758, BR-12227010 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil; [Haala, Norbert] Univ Stuttgart, IfP, Geschwister Scholl Str 24D, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany; [Karpina, Mateusz] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Geodesy & Geoinformat, Norwida 25, PL-50375 Wroclaw, Poland; [de Aragao, Luiz Eduardo Oliveira e Cruz] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE); University of Stuttgart; Institute of Geodesy & Cartography; Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences; University of Exeter,"Lotte, RG (corresponding author), Natl Inst Space Res, Remote Sensing Div, Av Astronautas 1758, BR-12227010 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil.",lotte@dsr.inpe.br; norbert.haala@ifp.uni-stuttgart.de; mateusz.karpina@igig.up.wroc.pl; laragao@dsr.inpe.br; yosio@dsr.inpe.br,,,,,,,,13,13,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2018,10,9,,,,,,,1435,10.3390/rs10091435,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10091435,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000449993800115,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the study of real-time, noncontact measurements of personal thermal comfort and the corresponding control system is not comprehensive. This paper aims to propose a workflow to design an adaptive facade that considers occupants' glare and thermal discomfort. From 280 valid questionnaires, the correlation between 13 defined postures and glare and thermal discomfort was determined. A CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is introduced to build a model to identify user behaviours. By taking the key point coordinates parsed by the OpenPose algorithm as input, the CNN-based model can recognize the 13 defined postures and a Sitting  type. An adaptive facade control system is proposed based on the captured occupant postures and spatial position. Validation results from volunteers showed that the CNN-based model could recognize user postures and respond immediately. After training for 40 epochs using 1260 videos as the training set, a model with 0.121 cross-entropy loss on the validation set was selected, and its accuracy reached 91.67% in the test. The adaptive facade units and the HVAC system are dynamically adjusted based on the extracted discomfort states. The set opening factor changes in steps of 0.1, and the set temperature of the HVAC system changes in steps of 1 degrees C at 15 min intervals. This allows the potential to build a personalized visual and thermal environment, which helps to improve the visual and thermal comfort of occupants.","[Wang, Yuxiao; Han, Yunsong; Wu, Yuran; Zhou, Zhibo] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuxiao; Han, Yunsong; Wu, Yuran; Zhou, Zhibo] Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Key Lab Cold Reg Urban & Rural Human Settlement E, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Korkina, Elena; Gagarin, Vladimir] Russian Acad Architecture & Construct Sci, Res Inst Bldg Phys, Moscow 127238, Russia; [Korkina, Elena; Gagarin, Vladimir] Moscow State Univ Civil Engn MGSU, Moscow 129337, Russia",Harbin Institute of Technology; Moscow State University of Civil Engineering,"Han, YS (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",hanyunsong@hit.edu.cn,,,,,,,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,APR 15,2022,214,,,,,,,,108907,10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.108907,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.108907,,FEB 2022,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000780379000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Further, the point cloud is sliced along the three coordinate axes after adjusting the point-cloud attitude of the building to ensure that its orientation is consistent with the Y-coordinate axis. Then, the feature points on each slice arc extracted, and straight-line-segment clustering is applied to the extracted feature points based on the cylinder growth method. Finally, the straight-line-segment fitting of the feature points is performed using the 1-norm minimum residual algorithm, and the endpoints of the straight line segment arc adjusted and refined. Subsequently, we validate the proposed method by applying it to several sets of experimental data; the experimental results exhibit improved accuracy, precision, and recall. The extraction accuracy of the straight line segment is half the average point spacing in the point cloud. The precision of the proposed method for extracting straight line segments is increased by 2.4% on average than that of the plane segmentation and image detection methods, whereas the recall is increased by 18.1% on average.

This paper aims to propose three different VFs and the authors define a novel machine learning-based approach to evaluate and predict their energy performance under different boundary conditions, without the need for expensive on-site experimentations Design/methodology/approach The approach is based on the use of machine learning algorithms for the evaluation of different VF configurations and allows for the prediction of the temperatures in the cavities and of the heat fluxes. The authors trained different regression algorithms and obtained low prediction errors, in particular for temperatures. The authors used such models to simulate the thermo-physical behavior of the VFs and determined the most energy-efficient design variant. Findings The authors found that regression trees allow for an accurate simulation of the thermal behavior of VFs. The authors also studied feature weights to determine the most relevant thermo-physical parameters. Finally, the authors determined the best design variant and the optimal air velocity in the cavity. Originality/value This study is unique in four main aspects: the thermo-dynamic analysis is performed under different thermal masses, positions of the cavity and geometries; the VFs are mated with a controlled ventilation system, used to parameterize the thermodynamic behavior under stepwise variations of the air inflow; temperatures and heat fluxes are predicted through machine learning models; the best configuration is determined through simulations, with no onerous in situ experimentations needed.","[Summa, Serena; Ulpiani, Giulia; Di Perna, Costanzo] Univ Politecn Marche, Fac Ingn, Dept Ind Engn & Math Sci, Ancona, Italy; [Mircoli, Alex; Potena, Domenico; Diamantini, Claudia] Univ Politecn Marche, Fac Ingn, Dept Informat Engn, Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University; Marche Polytechnic University,"Mircoli, A (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Marche, Fac Ingn, Dept Informat Engn, Ancona, Italy.",s.summa@pm.univpm.it; a.mircoli@univpm.it; d.potena@univpm.it; giuliaulpiani@gmail.com; c.diamantini@univpm.it; c.diperna@univpm.it,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,2022 JUN 22,2022,,,,,,,,,,10.1108/CI-11-2021-0229,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/CI-11-2021-0229,,JUN 2022,,Construction & Building Technology,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000813410600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Airborne Array InSAR point clouds are obtained from two scans for complete building information in urban areas, resulting in very low overlapping point cloud. The existing methods are difficult to extract the identical features for the registration of Array InSAR point clouds. To this end, a robust registration approach Array InSAR point clouds in urban areas is proposed in this study. The main contribution of this article is raising the theoretically optimal transformation for achieving point cloud registration, considering the constraint from parallel facades of a certain building. Point density estimation is adopted to retain building facade points for initial registration. The facade pairs of a specific building are then matched and divided into two categories by judging whether one contains the concave-convex features or not, for performing rotation rectification and fine shift fixation, respectively. Experimental results of both simulated and real data validate the feasibility and reliability of our approach.

For the real data, two evaluation criteria are designed for the lack of reference data.

To begin with, a camera drone with a spiral path is employed to capture building exterior images, and photogrammetry is used to conduct three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and create mesh models for the scanned building facades. High-resolution facade orthoimages are then generated from mesh models and pixelwise segmented by an artificial intelligence (AI) model named U-net. A combined data augmentation strategy, including random flipping, rotation, resizing, perspective transformation, and color adjustment, is proposed for model training with a limited number of labels. As a result, the U-net achieves an average pixel accuracy of 0.9696 and a mean intersection over union of 0.9063 in testing. Then, the developed twoStagesClustering algorithm, with a two-round shape clustering and a two-round coordinates clustering, is used to precisely extract facade elements' dimensions and coordinates from facade orthoimages and pixelwise label. In testing with the Michigan Central Station (office tower), a historic high-rise building, the developed algorithm achieves an accuracy of 99.77% in window extraction. In addition, the extracted facade geometric information and element types are transformed into AutoCAD command and script files to create CAD drawings without manual interaction. Experimental results also show that the proposed Scan4Facade method can provide clear and accurate information to assist BIM feature creation in Revit. Future research recommendations are also stated in this paper.

Deep learning is a promising approach to facade parsing, however, a straightforward solution by directly applying standard deep learning approaches cannot always yield the optimal results. This is primarily due to two reasons: 1) it is nontrivial to train existing semantic segmentation networks for facade parsing, e.g., Fully-Convolutional Neural Networks (FCN) which are usually weak at predicting fine-grained shapes (J. Long et al., 2015); and 2) building facades are man-made architectures with highly regularized shape priors, and the prior knowledge plays an important role in facade parsing, for which how to integrate the prior knowledge into deep neural networks remains an open problem. In this paper, we present a novel symmetric loss function that can be used in deep neural networks for end-to-end training. This novel loss is based on the assumption that most of windows and doors have a highly symmetric rectangle shape, and it penalizes all window predictions that are non-rectangles. This prior knowledge is smoothly integrated into the end-to-end training process. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our method has outperformed previous state-of-art methods significantly on five popular facade parsing datasets. Qualitative results have shown that our method effectively aids deep convolutional neural networks to predict more accurate, visually pleasing, and symmetric shapes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate symmetry constraint into end-to-end training in deep neural networks for facade parsing.","[Liu, Hantang; Xu, Yinghao; Zhang, Jialiang; Zhu, Jianke; Li, Yang] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jianke] Alibaba Zhejiang Univ Joint Res Inst Frontier Tec, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Hoi, Steven C.

However, compared to the manufacturing sector, labor productivity is low because of the high proportion of knowledge-based tasks and simple repetitive tasks. Therefore, knowledge-based task efficiency should be improved through the visual recognition of information by computers. A computer requires a large amount of training data, such as the ImageNet project, to recognize visual information. This paper proposes facade datasets that are efficiently constructed by quickly collecting facade data through road-view images generated from web portals and automatically labeled using deep learning as part of the construction of image datasets for visual recognition construction by a computer. Therefore, we attempted to automatically label facade images to quickly generate large-scale facade datasets with much less effort than the existing research methods. Simultaneously, we constructed datasets for a part of Dongseong-ro, Daegu Metropolitan City, and analyzed their utility and reliability. It was confirmed that the computer could extract significant facade information from the road-view images by recognizing the visual information of the facade image. In addition, we verified the characteristics of the building construction image datasets. This study suggests the possibility of securing quantitative and qualitative facade design knowledge by extracting facade design information from facades anywhere in the world. Previous studies mainly collected facade images through camera photography to construct databases, but in this study, a significant part of the database construction process was shortened through automation.

According to the results, a decrease in temperature and relative humidity was seen in the case of the building with a green wall. It was found that the green wall could drop the indoor temperature by 9% and also decrease the relative humidity level by 32%. Besides, in order to predict the green wall performance in a short time interval, a deep artificial neural network was trained from the experimental data and a 15-day weather dataset was collected and fed into the deep learning model. Moreover, the ENVI-met software is utilized to evaluate the effect of the green wall on the surrounding air.

Accordingly, there is a growing interest in automatic cleaning robots that move around the outer building facade. These robots are also required to apply different cleaning methods to remove various contaminants on the outer wall of the building. However, current surface contaminant detection systems can either detect only a single type of contaminant, or are not compact enough for installation on mobile platforms that move around the outer facade. As cleaning workers are able to distinguish various contaminants with the naked eye, we aim to solve this problem by developing a machine-vision system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image processing methods. As it is a compact system that uses only a camera to take pictures and a processor to process the images, it is suitable for applications involving mobile platforms. Object-type contaminants such as avian feces are handled by the YOLOv3 module using the object-detection algorithm. Area-type contaminants such as rusty stains are processed using the color-detection module using the HSV color space, median filter, and flood fill algorithm. Particle-type contaminants such as dust are handled by the grayscale module, converting images to grayscale images and then comparing the average brightness with a reference that is provided in advance. This proposed machine vision system will detect objects, areas, and particle-type contaminants with a single image and some reference images provided in advance.","[Lee, Jiseok; Park, Garam; Seo, TaeWon] Hanyang Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea; [Hong, Jooyoung] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Kim, Hwa Soo] Kyounggi Univ, Sch Mech Syst Engn, Suwon 16227, South Korea; [Lee, Sungon] Hanyang Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Ansan 15588, South Korea",Hanyang University; Seoul National University (SNU); Hanyang University,"Seo, T (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea.;Lee, S (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Ansan 15588, South Korea.",sungon@hanyang.ac.kr; taewonseo@hanyang.ac.kr,,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,8,,,,,,180010,180021,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3027839,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3027839,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000578630800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Existing methods lack efficiency, robustness, and accuracy, and depend on many additional features such as point cloud reflectivity and color. This paper proposes a robust and automatic method to extract building facade maps. First, an improved 3D Hough transform is proposed by adding shift vote and 3D convolution of the accumulator to improve computational efficiency and reduce peak fuzziness and dependence on the step selection. These modifications make the extraction of potential planes fast and accurate. Second, the coplane and vertical plane constraints are introduced to eliminate pseudoplanes and nonbuilding facades. Then, we propose a strategy to refine the potential facade and to achieve the accurate calibration and division of the adjacent facade boundaries by clustering the refined point clouds of the facade. This process solves the problem where adjoining surfaces are merged into the same surface in the traditional method. Finally, the extracted facade point clouds are converted into feature images. Doors, windows, and building edges are accurately extracted via deep learning and digital image processing techniques, which combine to achieve accurate extraction of building facades. The proposed method was tested on the MLS and TLS point cloud datasets, which were collected from different cities with different building styles. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method decreases computational burden, improves efficiency, and achieves the accurate differentiation of adjacent facade boundaries with higher accuracy compared with the traditional method, verifying the robustness of the method. Additionally, the proposed method uses only point cloud geometry information, effectively reducing data requirements and acquisition costs.","[Yu, Bing; Hu, Jinlong; Dong, Xiujun; Xiao, Dongsheng; Wu, Tao; Hu, Yunliang; Wang, Bing] Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geomat, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China; [Dong, Xiujun; Dai, Keren] Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Geohazard Prevent & Geoenvironm Pro, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Dai, Keren] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Earth Sci, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bo] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Fac Geosci & Environm Engn, Chengdu 611756, Peoples R China",Southwest Petroleum University; Chengdu University of Technology; Chengdu University of Technology; Southwest Jiaotong University,"Dong, XJ (corresponding author), Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geomat, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China.;Dong, XJ (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Geohazard Prevent & Geoenvironm Pro, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China.",dongxiujun@cdut.cn,,,,,,,,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2022,14,16,,,,,,,3848,10.3390/rs14163848,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14163848,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000845285400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These methods also make it challenging to identify the role of the building function in controlling and guiding urban color planning. This paper explores a city-scale approach to facade color measurement with building functional classification using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and street view images. Firstly, we used semantic segmentation to extract building facades and conducted the color calibration of the photos for pre-processing the collected street view images. Then, we proposed a color chart-based facade color measurement method and a multi-label deep learning-based building classification method. Next, the field survey data were used as the ground truth to verify the accuracy of the facade color measurement and building function classification. Finally, we applied our approach to generate facade color distribution maps with the building classification for three metropolises in China, and the results proved the transferability and effectiveness of the scheme. The proposed approach can provide city managers with an overall perception of urban facade color and building function across city-scale areas in a cost-efficient way, contributing to data-driven decision making for urban analytics and planning.","[Zhang, Jiaxin; Fukuda, Tomohiro; Yabuki, Nobuyoshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Div Sustainable Energy & Environm Engn, 2-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan",Osaka University,"Fukuda, T (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Div Sustainable Energy & Environm Engn, 2-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",zhang@it.see.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp; fukuda@see.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp; yabuki@see.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,,22,22,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2021,10,8,,,,,,,551,10.3390/ijgi10080551,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10080551,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000689226000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, various methods are elaborately designed for glass or transparent object detection in natural images but not for glass facades in oblique aerial images. In oblique aerial images, glass facade panels with salient boundaries are spatially related and have various sizes and appearances. For the glass facade segmentation task, we notice that semantic and instance segmentation methods have different strengths and failures. To get the best of both worlds, this letter presents an ensemble method to segment glass facades in oblique aerial images. A novel annotation strategy is adopted to preserve the spatial relationship between glass facade panels, and edge features are extracted to improve the detector's performance. Furthermore, we contribute a glass facade segmentation dataset (GFSD) to evaluate our method, which is a supplement to UAV image datasets.

The recent emergence of the potentiality of deep learning and computer vision has provided an alternative to traditional empirical-based judgment, which is limited by its subjective bias and high traversal costs. To address these challenges, this study aims to build a workflow for a visual analysis of function and facade to extract the different contributions that facade elements provide to functional expression. The approach is demonstrated with an experiment on a section of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) where large-scale historical buildings images were categorized to identify functions using deep learning, together with activation and substance for visual calculations. First, the dataset aggregated with images of historic buildings along the CER was used to identify functional categories using SE-DenseNet merging channel attention. The results of the model visualized using t-SNE and Grad-CAM were then used to analyze the relationships of facade features across functional categories and differences in elemental feature representation across functional prototypes. The results show the following: (1) SE-Densenet can more efficiently identify building functions from the closely linked facade images of historic building groups, with the average accuracy reaching 85.84%. (2) Urban-rural differences exist not only in the count of spatial distributions among the CER's historic building groups, but also in a significant visual divergence between functions related to urban life and those involved in the military, industry, and railways. (3) Windows and walls occupy areas with more characteristics, but their decorative elements have a higher intensity of features. The findings could enhance the objective understanding and deeper characteristics of the historical building group system, contributing to integrated conservation and characteristic sustainability.","[Li, Peilun; Zhao, Zhiqing; Chen, Yuling; Xie, Jiayu] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China; [Li, Peilun; Zhao, Zhiqing; Chen, Yuling; Xie, Jiayu] Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Key Lab Cold Reg Urban & Rural Human Settlement En, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China; [Li, Peilun; Zhao, Zhiqing; Chen, Yuling; Xie, Jiayu] Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Natl Terr Spatial Planning & Ecol Restorat, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China; [Li, Peilun; Chen, Yuling] Natl Univ Singapore, Coll Design & Engn, Singapore 117575, Singapore; [Zhang, Bocheng] Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Suzhou 215009, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; National University of Singapore; Suzhou University of Science & Technology,"Zhao, ZQ (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China.;Zhao, ZQ (corresponding author), Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Key Lab Cold Reg Urban & Rural Human Settlement En, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China.;Zhao, ZQ (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Natl Terr Spatial Planning & Ecol Restorat, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China.;Zhang, BC (corresponding author), Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Suzhou 215009, Peoples R China.",peilunli@hit.edu.cn; zzq@hit.edu.cn; bocheng@mail.usts.edu.cn; yulingchen@hit.edu.cn; jiayu.xie@stu.hit.edu.cn,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2023,15,22,,,,,,,15857,10.3390/su152215857,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su152215857,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001113761500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Due to a lack of computational design methodologies, existing digital design workflows do little in predicting design performance in the early design stage and in most cases analysis and design optimization are done after a design is fixed. This work proposes a new computational design methodology, intended for use in the area of conceptual design of building design. The proposed methodology is implemented into a multi-agent system design toolkit which facilitates the generation of design alternatives using stochastic algorithms and their evaluation using multiple environmental performance metrics. The method allows the user to probabilistically explore the solution space by modeling the design parameters' architectural design components (i.e. facade panel) into modular programming blocks (agents) which interact in a bottom-up fashion. Different problem requirements (i.e. level of daylight inside a space, openings) described into agents' behavior allow for the coupling of data from different engineering fields (environmental design, structural design) into the a priori formation of architectural geometry. In the presented design experiment, a facade panel is modeled into an agent-based fashion and the multi-agent system toolkit is used to generate and evolve alternative facade panel configurations based on environmental parameters (daylight, energy consumption). The designer can develop the facade panel geometry, design behaviors, and performance criteria to evaluate the design alternatives. The toolkit relies on modular and functionally specific programming modules (agents), which provide a platform for facade design exploration by combining existing three-dimensional modeling and analysis software.","[Pantazis, Evangelos; Gerber, David] Univ Southern Calif, Viterbi Sch Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Pantazis, E (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Viterbi Sch Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",epantazi@usc.edu,,,,,,,,14,16,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2018,16,4,,,SI,,248,270,,10.1177/1478077118805874,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1478077118805874,,,,Architecture,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000453098700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The existing design workflow for architects is laborious from the research phase to the final plans, and yet the results are subjective, especially when facing a large-scale urban renovation. Recent works show that generative adversarial networks (GANs) have surprising potential for creating un-presented images following certain rules under various domains, including architecture. However, research on adopting GANs to optimize the conventional design process of historic urban areas renovation is still missing. This study contributes as a decision support tool for urban renovation based on GANs to abstract historic architecture styles and automatically generate stylized facades. One self-made dataset of facade and label information from Harbin Central Street was created, and one data augmentation process was proposed and examined. The generated designs were evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, and demonstrated high accuracy, reality, and diversity levels. Two in situ and off-site applications proved the feasibility and adaptability of the proposed workflow. Through all evaluations and application cases, it is justified that the proposed GAN-based design strategy can greatly benefit the conventional historic urban area renovation design process.","[Sun, Cheng; Zhou, Yiran; Han, Yunsong] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Sun, Cheng; Zhou, Yiran; Han, Yunsong] Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Key Lab Cold Reg Urban & Rural Human Settlement E, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Han, YS (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",hanyunsong@hit.edu.cn,,,,,,,,13,13,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 15,2022,212,,,,,,,,108781,10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.108781,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.108781,,JAN 2022,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000780182100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A reliable and simplified macro approach called Multi Pier (MP) method was employed to analyze single masonry piers with different aspect ratios (h/l). The shear and flexural strength along with the failure mechanism of each pier were obtained versus various levels of axial force during the sensitivity analysis. The results of the analysis were used as an input of a machine learning approach called Back Propagation Multi-Layer Perceptron (BPMLP) to generalize the data. The outcomes of machine learning was utilized to develop simple, but accurate equations as well as a user-friendly application to obtain the shear strength of a masonry pier according to the mechanical and geometrical properties. The BPMLP network is also able to produce and estimate all potential failure modes of a masonry wall. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed equations and developed application was evaluated using a novel macro-element approach. It is concluded that the proposed equations can be used in any macro-elements approach to enhancing efficiency and saving time. The proposed Equivalent Wall (EW) model was able to precisely estimate the response of full-scale facade masonry walls subjected to the in-plane loads. According to this model, each pier and spandrel was substituted by two elastic continuous (2D) macro-elements which connected via two bi-component discrete el-ements. A linear behavior based on masonry modulus of elasticity and bi-linear constitution according to the shear strength was assigned to the axial and shears components of the discrete links, respectively. The proposed EW model was verified using a five-story-seven-bay masonry wall. Satisfactory results were observed in terms of global load-deflection behavior comparing with popular approaches from the literature.","[Li, Hongbo; Li, Jing] Wuchang Univ Technol, Sch Intelligent Construction, Wuhan 430223, Peoples R China; [Li, Hongbo] CCCC Third Harbor Constructions Co Ltd, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Farhangi, Visar] No Arizona Univ, Dept Civil Engn Construction Management & Environm, Flagstaff, AZ USA",Wuchang University of Technology; Northern Arizona University,"Li, HB (corresponding author), Wuchang Univ Technol, Sch Intelligent Construction, Wuhan 430223, Peoples R China.;Li, HB (corresponding author), CCCC Third Harbor Constructions Co Ltd, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.",lhb20211005@126.com; visar.farhangi@nau.edu,,,,,,,,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2023,49,,,,,,443,466,,10.1016/j.istruc.2023.01.095,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.istruc.2023.01.095,,FEB 2023,,"Engineering, Civil",,,,,,Y,N,2024-01-16,WOS:000931068200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Through the application of Artificial Intelligence many design decisions can be made automatically. Since most design tasks are ultimately unique and therefore not operational, fully automatic facade design will not always lead to a satisfactory result. For these reasons, the authors propose a targeted combination of rational (rule-based) and intuitive (poetic) design strategies. The design task is divided into operational subtasks that are processed automatically on the computer and non-operational subtasks that are solved by computers and humans together. A creative and agile design team evaluates different variants proposed by the computer. Promising developments will be pursued and further developed. Then the generative mechanism is adapted and the design is optimized. The concept is refined until a sustainable, user-oriented design is available. However, for the foreseeable future, the solution of non-operational problems will only be possible through human intelligence. The fear that good architecture can be generated at the push of a button and that computers will replace architects and engineers is therefore unfounded.","[Heusler, Winfried; Kadija, Ksenija] Schuco Int KG, Global Bldg Excellence, Karolinenstr 1-15, D-33609 Bielefeld, Germany; [Heusler, Winfried] Univ Appl Sci, Detmold Sch Architecture & Interior Architecture, Detmold, Germany",,"Heusler, W (corresponding author), Schuco Int KG, Global Bldg Excellence, Karolinenstr 1-15, D-33609 Bielefeld, Germany.",WHeusler@schueco.com,,,,,,,,1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,2018,10,4,,,,,220,233,,10.1080/17508975.2018.1493979,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17508975.2018.1493979,,,,Construction & Building Technology,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000445817800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The current inspection procedure is labor-intensive and time-consuming and poses significant safety issues like falling from height. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with computer vision techniques represent a promising approach for visual crack inspection on high-rise building facades. One research challenge to achieving automated visual crack inspection is image degradation in the form of motion blur caused by UAVs during image acquisition. Motion blur arises due to excessive vibrations of the UAV platform, and this may adversely affect crack detection. In this paper, a deep learning-based deblurring model based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed to address this challenge. Further, by recognizing a strong correlation between blurred and sharpened crack images, the idea of using a localized skip connection is introduced. Experimental validation of the proposed deblurring model is carried out by investigating the impact of skip connections on deblurring. The proposed model is also compared against the state-of-the-art deblurring model, and results indicate that the proposed model is able to achieve significant improvements in deblurring performance in terms of both global structure and feature details in crack images.","[Liu, Yiqing; Yeoh, Justin K.

Thus, nowadays, utilizing fa ade-cleaning robots seems inevitable. However, in case of navigating on cracked glass, these robots may cause hazardous situations. Accordingly, it seems necessary to equip them with crack-detection system to eventually avoid cracked area. In this study, benefitting from convolutional neural networks developed in TensorFlow (TM), a deep-learning-based crack detection approach is introduced for a novel modular facade-cleaning robot. For experimental purposes, the robot is equipped with an on-board camera and the live video is loaded using OpenCV. The vision-based training process is fulfilled by applying two different optimizers utilizing a sufficiently generalized data-set. Data augmentation techniques and also image pre-processing also apply as a part of process. Simulation and experimental results show that the system can hit the milestone on crack-detection with an accuracy around 90%. This is satisfying enough to replace human-conducted on-site inspections. In addition, a thorough comparison between the performance of optimizers is put forward: Adam optimizer shows higher precision, while Adagrad serves more satisfying recall factor, however, Adam optimizer with the lowest false negative rate and highest accuracy has a better performance. Furthermore, proposed CNN's performance is compared to traditional NN and the results provide a remarkable difference in success level, proving the strength of CNN.","[Kouzehgar, Maryam; Heredia, Manuel Vega; Elara, Mohan Rajesh] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Engn Prod & Dev Pillar, Singapore 487372, Singapore; [Tamilselvam, Yokhesh Krishnasamy] Univ Western Ontario, Elect Engn Dept Robot, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Heredia, Manuel Vega] Univ Occidente, Engn & Technol Dept, Campus Los Mochis, Sinaloa 81223, Mexico",Singapore University of Technology & Design; Western University (University of Western Ontario); Universidad de Occidente,"Kouzehgar, M (corresponding author), Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Engn Prod & Dev Pillar, Singapore 487372, Singapore.",maryam_kouzehgar@sutd.edu.sg; ykrishn4@uwo.ca; manuel_vega@sutd.edu.sg; rajeshelara@sutd.edu.sg,,,,,,,,50,52,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2019,108,,,,,,,,102959,10.1016/j.autcon.2019.102959,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2019.102959,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000500381900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Wind-induced airflow plays a significant role in improving occupants' comfort in a building. This paper explores the extent to which simulation and evaluation of natural airflow can potentially be a contributing parameter in the conception of performance-aware designs. The authors employed Fast Fluid Dynamics simulation to study the natural ventilation performance of a pavilion and a genetic algorithm to optimize the shape of the pavilion's facades' openings. A performance analysis was conducted whereby an array of automated feedback loops carried out by a genetic algorithm produce a number of acceptable solutions. Hence the facade openings of these solutions are considered to be adequate to provide natural ventilation in the indoor environment. The study demonstrates the ability of the optimization model to yield design instances that fulfill a number of environmental criteria related to airflow and human comfort. In this light, the authors suggest that the aforementioned method can be used as an experimentation platform to influence and guide the designer during the initial stages of the design process towards a more performance-driven solution.","[Karagkouni, Chrysanthi (Sandy); Schieck, Ava Fatah Gen; Tsigkari, Martha; Chronis, Angelos] UCL, Bartlett Sch Grad Studies, London WC1H 0NN, England",University of London; University College London,"Karagkouni, C (corresponding author), UCL, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",chrysanthi.karagkouni.11@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,,4,5,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2014,90,8,,,SI,,978,990,,10.1177/0037549714537133,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0037549714537133,,,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000340717900008,View Full Record in Web of Science
