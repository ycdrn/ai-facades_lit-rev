Conceptually, the scaffolds collapsed by the warning system developed in the study contains three modules. The first module involves the establishment of wind velocity prediction models. This study employed various deep learning and machine learning techniques, namely deep neural networks, long short-term memory neural networks, support vector regressions, random forest, and k-nearest neighbors. Then, the second module contains the analysis of wind force on the scaffolds. The third module involves the development of the scaffold collapse evaluation approach. The study area was Taichung City, Taiwan. This study collected meteorological data from the ground stations from 2012 to 2019. Results revealed that the system successfully predicted the possible collapse time for scaffolds within 1 to 6 h, and effectively issued a warning time.

Due to the difficulty of data collection and lack of facade information, the remote sensing methods currently used for landslide mapping and detection are insufficient. The current landslide information acquisition method is mainly based on visual interpretation and automatic computer classification from aerial orthophotographs, which is subjective and time-consuming and yields low accuracy. New shipborne photogrammetry has unique advantages in small and steep slope landslide detection. In recent years, the deep learning technology represented by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibits more powerful feature learning ability in image recognition than traditional machine learning technology. Meanwhile, transfer learning can make the network suitable for small datasets through fine-tuning, which could transfer the parameters of the pretrained model to the new model in a certain way, thereby increasing the learning efficiency of the model. In this paper, the training of multiple deep learning models is realized through transfer learning, and automatic identification of landslides based on shipborne images is achieved through decision-level fusion. The experimental results show that through the integration of decision-level fusion and transfer learning, it performs well in the classification of landslides based on shipborne images.","[Feng, Quanlong] China Agr Univ, Coll Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Li, Yi; Gong, Jianhua] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Natl Engn Res Ctr Geoinformat, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ping; Ji, Xiaohui] Chinese Univ Geosci, Sch Informat Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Jin, Dingjian] China Aero Geophys Survey & Remote Sensing Ctr Nat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Feng, QL (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",liyi@aircas.ac.cn; 2104200060@cugb.edu.cn; fengql@cau.edu.cn; xhji@cugb.edu.cn; jindj@radi.ac.cn; gongjh@aircas.ac.cn,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2023,20,3,,,,,547,558,,10.1007/s10346-022-01997-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10346-022-01997-2,,DEC 2022,,"Engineering, Geological; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000893364400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This work aims to optimize the safety analysis results of the underground building envelope and comprehensively improve the safety of the underground building. Long short-term memory (LSTM) can make long-term and short-term predictions, thus reducing the model's prediction error. Applying it to the deformation analysis, data prediction of the underground building envelope can improve the accuracy of the deformation prediction of the envelope. This work deeply discusses deep learning technology and the principle of the LSTM model. Based on the safety analysis concept of the underground building envelope, LSTM underground building envelope deformation's prediction model is established and comprehensively evaluated. The results show that in the prediction of horizontal displacement of foundation pit pile of diaphragm wall, the mean relative error (MRE) of the prediction results of the designed model range in 10%-18%, and the calculation time ranges 15-36 s. In the settlement displacement prediction, the model's MRE is within the range of 5%-7%, and the calculation time is within the range of 17-40 s. With the increase of training times, the prediction accuracy of the model increases, and the calculation time becomes relatively stable. Compared with other models, the relative error of prediction results is about 5.4% at the highest and 1.8% at the lowest.

These can serve as initial steps towards automatic generation of as-built BIM. Specifically, 3D point clouds are generated from multiple images using structure from motion method and then segmented into planar components, which are further recognized as different structural components through knowledge based reasoning.

These robots are also required to apply different cleaning methods to remove various contaminants on the outer wall of the building. However, current surface contaminant detection systems can either detect only a single type of contaminant, or are not compact enough for installation on mobile platforms that move around the outer facade. As cleaning workers are able to distinguish various contaminants with the naked eye, we aim to solve this problem by developing a machine-vision system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image processing methods.

Moreover, most of the existing literature has utilized the Pix2Pix algorithm for facade generation experiments, failing to attempt to replace the original generator in Pix2Pix with a different generator for experiments. This study addresses the above issues by collecting and filtering entries from the international Solar Decathlon (SD competition) to obtain a data set.

In case of historic buildings with massive walls, internal insulation is often the only feasible post-insulation technique. Drawback of internal insulation is the modified hygrothermal response of the wall, which can result in moisture damage. Hence, it is crucial to assess the risk of damage accurately beforehand. Given the many uncertainties involved, a probabilistic assessment is advisable. This, however, would require thousands of simulations, which easily becomes computationally inhibitive. To overcome this time-efficiency issue, this paper proposes the use of neural networks to replace the original hygrothermal model. The neural network is trained on a small data set obtained from the hygrothermal model and can subsequently be used to predict the hygrothermal behaviour of building components with different boundary conditions and geometry. The transient nature of the hygrothermal behaviour requires a neural network type which can handle long-range time-dependencies. In the past, recurrent neural networks were often used for this type of data. Recently however, results indicate that convolutional neural networks can outperform recurrent neural networks on such tasks. This paper compares the prediction accuracy and training time of both neural network types for the prediction of the hygrothermal behaviour of building components.","[Tijskens, Astrid; Roels, Staf; Janssen, Hans] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Civil Engn, Bldg Phys Sect, Kasteelpk Arenberg 40 Bus 2447, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Tijskens, A (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Civil Engn, Bldg Phys Sect, Kasteelpk Arenberg 40 Bus 2447, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.",astrid.tijskens@kuleuven.be,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,282,,,,,,,,2036,10.1051/matecconf/201928202036,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/matecconf/201928202036,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Industrial",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000558388100037,View Full Record in Web of Science

The proposed method determines a set of candidate planes by sampling and clustering points from the image with Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), using local normal estimates derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to inform the planar model. The corresponding disparity map and a discriminative classification provide prior information for a two-layer Markov Random Field model. This MRF problem is solved via Graph Cuts to obtain a labeling of building facade pixels at the mid-level, and a segmentation of those pixels into particular planes at the high-level.

However, the previous object removal typically requires a user to manually create a mask around unwanted objects and obtain background facade information in advance, which would be labor-intensive when implementing multitasking projects. Moreover, accurately detecting objects to be removed in the cityscape and inpainting the static obstructed building facade to obtain plausible images are the main challenges for this objective. To overcome these difficulties, this study addresses the object removal with the facade inpainting problem from the following two aspects. First, we proposed an image-based cityscape elimination method for automatic object removal and facade inpainting by applying semantic segmentation to detect several classes, including pedestrians, riders, vegetation, and cars, as well as using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for filling detected regions by background textures and patching information from street-level imagery. Second, we proposed a workflow to filter unoccluded building facades from street view images automatically and tailored a dataset for the GAN-based image inpainting model with original and mask images. Furthermore, several full-reference image quality assessment (IQA) metrics are introduced to evaluate the generated image quality. Validation results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed method, and the synthetic image is visually realistic and semantically consistent.","[Zhang, Jiaxin; Fukuda, Tomohiro; Yabuki, Nobuyoshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Div Sustainable Energy & Environm Engn, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan",Osaka University,"Fukuda, T (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Div Sustainable Energy & Environm Engn, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",fukuda@see.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,9,,,,,,117486,117495,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3106124,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3106124,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000690431800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although the artificial intelligence technology has made a breakthrough in image segmentation, it is nontrivial to directly apply standard deep learning approaches for building facade element detection. The main reason is that the existing semantic segmentation networks have a bad performance in predicting highly regularized shapes. This research develops a hieratical deep learning framework with a symmetric loss function to automatically detect building facade elements from images. The new framework contains two types of attention modules, namely, the spatial attention module, and the channel attention module. A new loss function is designed to integrate prior engineering knowledge, which can be used to force the detection of facade elements (e.g., windows, doors, concrete walls, and sunshades) to have a highly proportionate shape. The effectiveness of the developed approach is demonstrated in two public datasets. Experimental results indicate that the developed deep learning framework with a new loss function outperforms state-of-the-art models significantly, where the achieved a Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) on the Ecole Centrale Paris(ECP) dataset (81.9%) brings an improvement of 11.3% over Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and 4.0% over Deepfacade, respectively, and the achieved a Mean IoU on the ArtDeco dataset (85.6%) yields an improvement of 11.4% over FCN and 5.8% over Deepfacade, respectively. Moreover, the developed approach is more practical and effective to detect regularized facade elements, where the detection of the wall components has an IoU of 93.6% on the ECP dataset and 88.6% on the ArtDeco dataset, respectively. Overall, the contribution from the technical aspect is to develop a hieratical deep learning framework consisting of attention modules together with the newly designed loss function and the prior engineering knowledge. The contribution from the practical aspect is to realize the automatic and accurate detection for various building facade elements in complex environments, which can be potentially helpful for the infrastructure monitoring and maintenance operation.","[Zhang, Gaowei; Pan, Yue; Zhang, Limao] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Pan, Yue] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Shanghai Key Lab Digital Maintenance Bldg & Infra, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Zhang, LM (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",gwzhang@ntu.edu.sg; panyue001@sjtu.edu.cn; limao.zhang@ntu.edu.sg,,,,,,,,24,26,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2022,133,,,,,,,,104016,10.1016/j.autcon.2021.104016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2021.104016,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000787885200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, alleviating the impact of shadows in street-view images (SVIs) to assess building facade color is another research gap that is difficult to address. This paper proposes an efficient approach for evaluating HBFC on a large-scale using SVIs and a deep learning algorithm. Specifically, a shadow processing method was developed, and transfer learning was integrated into the harmoniousness evaluation process. The historical district of Guangzhou, China, was selected as a case study area.

High fidelity models of building electricity consumption are needed to set appropriate baselines for measurement and verification (M&V) of controllers designed for energy efficient operation of buildings and to enable buildings to provide grid services via. participation in demand response programs. State-of-the-art modeling techniques for building electricity consumption either rely on physics-based models, or extensive instrumentation of the building envelope to gather big data to train machine learning based models such as deep neural networks. While physics-based models are often limited by their accuracy, it is not always feasible to gather a significant amount of field data required to train machine learning based models with sufficient accuracy. In this paper, we explore the use of transfer learning-based strategies to address unsatisfactory accuracy of models for estimating building electricity consumption when available field data for training is sparse or of unacceptable quality. In particular, we transfer knowledge in the form of data and parameters, from physics-based simulation frameworks to the field to improve the model accuracy, thus resulting in a physics-informed machine learning framework. We evaluated the efficacy of our approach on field data collected from six commercial buildings and our results indicate that the proposed transfer learning-based models provide comparative (and in some cases better) accuracy than state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning solutions, with just one month of field data.","[Jain, Milan; Gupta, Khushboo; Sathanur, Arun; Chandan, Vikas; Halappanavar, Mahantesh M.] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,"Jain, M (corresponding author), Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA.",milan.jain@pnnl.gov; khushboo.gupta@pnnl.gov; arun.sathanur@pnnl.gov; vikas.chandan@pnnl.gov; hala@pnnl.gov,,,,,,,,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,,,,,,,2887,2894,,,,,,,"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000702263302156,View Full Record in Web of Science

The current inspection procedure is labor-intensive and time-consuming and poses significant safety issues like falling from height. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with computer vision techniques represent a promising approach for visual crack inspection on high-rise building facades. One research challenge to achieving automated visual crack inspection is image degradation in the form of motion blur caused by UAVs during image acquisition. Motion blur arises due to excessive vibrations of the UAV platform, and this may adversely affect crack detection. In this paper, a deep learning-based deblurring model based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed to address this challenge. Further, by recognizing a strong correlation between blurred and sharpened crack images, the idea of using a localized skip connection is introduced. Experimental validation of the proposed deblurring model is carried out by investigating the impact of skip connections on deblurring. The proposed model is also compared against the state-of-the-art deblurring model, and results indicate that the proposed model is able to achieve significant improvements in deblurring performance in terms of both global structure and feature details in crack images.","[Liu, Yiqing; Yeoh, Justin K.

Deep learning is a promising approach to facade parsing, however, a straightforward solution by directly applying standard deep learning approaches cannot always yield the optimal results. This is primarily due to two reasons: 1) it is nontrivial to train existing semantic segmentation networks for facade parsing, e.g., Fully-Convolutional Neural Networks (FCN) which are usually weak at predicting fine-grained shapes (J. Long et al., 2015); and 2) building facades are man-made architectures with highly regularized shape priors, and the prior knowledge plays an important role in facade parsing, for which how to integrate the prior knowledge into deep neural networks remains an open problem. In this paper, we present a novel symmetric loss function that can be used in deep neural networks for end-to-end training. This novel loss is based on the assumption that most of windows and doors have a highly symmetric rectangle shape, and it penalizes all window predictions that are non-rectangles. This prior knowledge is smoothly integrated into the end-to-end training process. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our method has outperformed previous state-of-art methods significantly on five popular facade parsing datasets. Qualitative results have shown that our method effectively aids deep convolutional neural networks to predict more accurate, visually pleasing, and symmetric shapes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate symmetry constraint into end-to-end training in deep neural networks for facade parsing.","[Liu, Hantang; Xu, Yinghao; Zhang, Jialiang; Zhu, Jianke; Li, Yang] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jianke] Alibaba Zhejiang Univ Joint Res Inst Frontier Tec, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Hoi, Steven C.

Basically, the strategy, known as intelligentco-simulation, constructs new mathematical models through a learning procedure (training period) that is performed using the input-output data generated by a standard co-simulation, where the models of specialized software are employed. Once the learning phase is complete, the specialized software is disconnected from the BPS and the simulation goes on by using the synthesized models, requiring a much lower computational cost and with a low impact on the accuracy of the results. The synthesis of accurate-and-fast models is performed through machine learning techniques and the purpose of this paper is precisely a deep investigation of two techniques - recurrent neural networks and proper orthogonal decomposition reduction method, whose main goal is to reduce the training time period and to improve the accuracy. The case study focuses on a co-simulationbetween Domus and CFX programs, performing a two-dimensional diffusive heat transfer problem through a building envelope. The results show that for a standard co-simulationof 14h, the intelligent co-simulationprovided a reduction of 90% in the computer run time with accuracy error at the order of (10(-2)).","[Berger, Julien] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, CNRS, LOCIE, F-73000 Chambery, France; [Mazuroski, Walter; Mendes, Nathan] Pontif Catholic Univ Parana, Mech Engn Grad Program, Thermal Syst Lab, BR-80215901 Curitiba, PR, Brazil; [Oliveira, Ricardo C.

Computer vision-based techniques provide opportunities to autonomously detect such heat anomalies to significantly improve the efficiency of decision-making for building envelope retrofitting and maintenance. In this work, we propose a novel Capsule Network-based deep learning model - CapsLab - that detects and identifies thermal anomalies by semantic segmentation. CapsLab is built based on our proposed prediction-tuning capsule (PT-Capsule) layer. Different from a traditional capsule layer, which consists of part-whole transformation and capsule-routing process, the proposed layer is composed of a prediction and tuning process, which helps decreasing the number of model parameters significantly. While the applicability of traditional Capsule Networks (CapsNets) has been limited to simpler tasks and smaller datasets due to their scalability issue, we can leverage the lightweight of the proposed PT-Capsule layer, and apply it to the semantic segmentation task. In this work, we also employ our previously presented performance metric, referred to as the Anomaly Identification Metric (AIM) (Kakillioglua et al. 2021), to evaluate the segmentation outputs. Traditional performance metrics do not accurately reflect the true performance of the segmentation models in thermal anomaly identification due to the high subjectivity in the annotation process and higher overlap ratio sensitivity of the standard metrics. AIM, on the other hand, is robust to these drawbacks. Experimental results show, both qualitatively and quantitatively, that our proposed segmentation method can effectively segment the thermal anomalies. Specifically, our model provides 9.38% and 13.53% improvements over the baseline model - DeepLabV3+ - based on traditional mIoU score and the AIM score, respectively, while requiring less model parameters and less computation at the same time. In addition, the scores that the AIM metric generates better align with the scores provided by building performance experts.","[Pan, Chenbin; Wang, Jiyang; Chai, Weiheng; Velipasalar, Senem] Syracuse Univ, Syracuse, NY USA; [Kakillioglu, Burak] Motorola Solut Inc, Chicago, MA 60661 USA; [El Masri, Yasser; Panagoulia, Eleanna; Rakha, Tarek] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA USA; [Bayomi, Norhan; Fernandez, John E.] MIT, Cambridge, MA USA; [Chen, Kaiwen] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL USA",Syracuse University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Kakillioglu, B (corresponding author), Motorola Solut Inc, Chicago, MA 60661 USA.",bkakilli@syr.edu,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2022,54,,,,,,,,101767,10.1016/j.aei.2022.101767,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2022.101767,,OCT 2022,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Multidisciplinary",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000877545400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper aims to evaluate the appli-cability of deep learning networks in estimating the energy savings of different facade alternatives in the early-stage design of buildings. The energy performance of two competing facade systems (i.e., Ultra-High-Performance Fiber-Reinforced-Concrete and conventional panels) was estimated for different scenarios through building en-ergy simulations using EnergyPlusrm. Three deep learning networks were trained using the collected data from the simulation of fourteen buildings in fourteen different locations to estimate the heating, cooling, and total site energy savings. The accuracy of trained deep networks was compared with the accuracy of three common data-driven prediction models including, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, and Generalized Linear Regression. The results showed that the deep learning network trained to predict building total site energy savings had the highest accuracy among other models with a mean absolute error of 1.59 and a root mean square error of 3.48, followed by Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, and last Generalized Linear Regression. Similarly, deep networks trained to predict building cooling and heating energy savings had the lowest mean average error of 0.20 and 1.17, respectively, compared to other predictive models. It is expected the decision support system developed based on this methodology helps architects and designers to quantify the energy savings of different facade systems in early stages of design decisions.","[Abediniangerabi, B.; Shahandashti, M.] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Civil Engn, 416 S Yates St, Arlington, TX 76010 USA; [Makhmalbaf, A.] Univ Texas Arlington, Sch Architecture, 601 W Nedderman Dr, Arlington, TX 76010 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Abediniangerabi, B (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Civil Engn, 416 S Yates St, Arlington, TX 76010 USA.",bahram.abediniangerabi@uta.edu; atefe.makhmalbaf@uta.edu; mohsen@uta.edu,,,,,,,,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2021,5,,,,,,,,100077,10.1016/j.egyai.2021.100077,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egyai.2021.100077,,,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Energy & Fuels",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001058083100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

One of the most important parameters for determining transmission losses is thermal transmittance. Although thermal transmittance does not take into account dynamic parameters, it is traditionally the most commonly used estimation of transmission losses due to its simplicity and efficiency. It is challenging to estimate the thermal transmittance of an existing building element because thermal properties are commonly unknown or not all the layers that make up the element can be found due to technical-drawing information loss. In such cases, experimental methods are essential, the most common of which is the heat-flux method (HFM). One of the main drawbacks of the HFM is the long measurement duration. This research presents the application of deep learning on HFM results by applying long-short term memory units on temperature difference and measured heat flux. This deep-learning regression problem predicts heat flux after the applied model is properly trained on temperature-difference input, which is backpropagated by measured heat flux. The paper shows the performance of the developed procedure on real-size walls under the simulated environmental conditions, while the possibility of practical application is shown in pilot in-situ measurements.","[Gumbarevi, Sanjin] Ericsson Nikola Tesla, Krapinska 45, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Milovanovi, Bojan; Gasi, Mergim] Univ Zagreb, Fac Civil Engn, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Basi, Bojana Dalbelo] Univ Zagreb, Fac Elect Engn & Comp, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Ericsson; University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb,"Gumbarevi, S (corresponding author), Ericsson Nikola Tesla, Krapinska 45, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",sanjin.gumbarevic@ericsson.com; bojan.milovanovic@grad.unizg.hr; bojana.dalbelo@fer.hr; mergim.gasi@grad.unizg.hr,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2022,15,14,,,,,,,5029,10.3390/en15145029,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15145029,,,,Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000831993600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, most existing methods focus on fully supervised learning, which relies on manually labeling large-scale point cloud data and results in high time and labor costs. In this article, we propose an effective weakly supervised building facade segmentation approach, called spatial adaptive fusion consistency contrastive constraint (SAF-C3), to solve the above problem. We first design a multirandom point cloud augmentor as an auxiliary supervision branch to enhance the learning ability of the original network branch. Then, we present a spatial adaptive fusion (SAF) module to extract discriminative features for building facade point clouds. Finally, we propose a spatial consistency contrastive constraint to explore the contrastive property in feature space and to ensure the predictive consistency among the augmentation and original branches.

We introduce an algorithm that filters detected keypoints before the matching is even attempted, by predicting the probability of each point to be successfully matched. This is realised using a flexible and time efficient Random Forest classifier. Experiments on stereo and multi-view datasets of building facades show that the proposed method decreases the computational cost of a subsequent keypoint matching and 3D reconstruction, by correctly filtering 50% of the points that wouldn't be matched while preserving 73% of the matchable keypoints. This enables a subsequent processing with minimal mismatches, provides reliable matches, and point clouds.

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors are effective in recognizing building facade components from (three-dimensional) 3D point clouds by regis-tering 3D spatial coordinates and radiometric information, which reveal the spectral property of a scanned surface. Although the radiometric information (i.e., intensity feature) can be used for segmentation, its accuracy may be reduced by factors such as scanning geometry and external factors that affect the object's radiometric information. To address this issue, this study proposes a robust and automated method for segmenting building facade components using LiDAR point cloud data and an empirical-based intensity correction model to ensure proper segmentation. The proposed method employs RandLA-Net, a deep learning model capable of effectively processing large-scale point cloud data, to classify building facade components based on their spatial features combined with corrected intensity features. By incorporating the proposed method into a digital twin, it is possible to perform accurate building facade segmentation and generate valuable insights into the building's physical condition, energy efficiency, and aesthetic value in real-time.

Unfortunately, the amount of effort required to label the data has significantly hindered the application of deep learning methods, especially in 3D modelling tasks requiring heterogeneous samples. This paper proposes a semi-supervised adversarial recognition strategy embedded in the inverse procedural modelling engine to reduce data annotation costs for learning to model 3D facades. Beginning with textured level-of-details models, we use convolutional neural networks to recognise the types and estimate the parameters of windows from image patches. The window types and parameters are then assembled into the procedural grammar. A simple procedural engine is built inside off-the-shelf 3D modelling software, producing fine-grained window geometries. To obtain a useful model from a few labelled samples, we leverage a generative adversarial network to train the feature extractor in a semi-supervised manner. The adversarial training strategy exploits the unlabelled data to stabilise the training phase. Experiments using publicly available facade image datasets reveal that the proposed methods can improve classification accuracy and parameter estimation by approximately 10% and 50%, respectively, under the same network structure.

In particular, mobile platform localization and guidance in urban environments can be enabled with accurate models of the various building facades in a scene. Toward that end, we present a system for detection, segmentation, and parameter estimation of building facades in stereo imagery. The proposed method incorporates multilevel appearance and disparity features in a binary discriminative model, and generates a set of candidate planes by sampling and clustering points from the image with Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), using local normal estimates derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to inform the planar models. These two models are incorporated into a two-layer Markov Random Field (MRF): an appearance- and disparity-based discriminative classifier at the mid-level, and a geometric model to segment the building pixels into facades at the high-level. By using object-specific stereo features, our discriminative classifier is able to achieve substantially higher accuracy than standard boosting or modeling with only appearance-based features. Furthermore, the results of our MRF classification indicate a strong improvement in accuracy for the binary building detection problem and the labeled planar surface models provide a good approximation to the ground truth planes.

Correspondingly, for planners, it is also difficult to accurately answer questions such as 'where the quality of the physical environment is the most dilapidated in the city that regeneration should be given first consideration' and 'in fast urbanising cities, how is the city appearance changing'. To address this issue, in the present study, we present a computer vision method that contains three machine learning models for the large-scale and automatic evaluation on the qualities of the urban environment by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and wide-coverage street view images. From various physical qualities that have been identified by previous research to be important for the urban visual experience, we choose two key qualities, the construction and maintenance quality of building facade and the continuity of street wall, to be measured in this research. To test the validity of the proposed method, we compare the machine scores with public rating scores collected on-site from 752 passers-by at 56 locations in the city.

The results show that: 1) playing is the most typical behaviour of children; 2) space with some degree of exposure has a more obvious effect on the distribution of children's behaviour, and most children prefer to play along the waterside; 3) children without independent action ability tend to play in a semi-open space with a safe and stable environment, while those with independent action ability choose their play space more freely; 4) integrated open space that can be easily accessed, has a waterfront landscape and is near a building facade, may significantly stimulate children's behaviour.","[Zeng, Rui; Li, Zao] Hefei Univ Technol, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China",Hefei University of Technology,"Li, Z (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Architecture & Art, Feicuihu Campus,19, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China.",lizao72@hotmail.com,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2018,17,1,,,,,47,54,,10.3130/jaabe.17.47,http://dx.doi.org/10.3130/jaabe.17.47,,,,Architecture; Construction & Building Technology,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000432368100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this letter, we propose a pyramid atrous large kernel (ALK) network (ALKNet) for the semantic segmentation of facade images. The pyramid ALKNet captures long-range dependencies among building elements by using ALK modules in multiscale feature maps. It makes full use of the regular structures of facades to aggregate useful nonlocal context information and thereby is capable of dealing with challenging image regions caused by occlusions, ambiguities, and so on.

However, existing methods for parsing building facades based on semantic segmentation have difficulties in distinguishing individual instances of connected buildings. Manually collecting and annotating instances of building facades in large datasets is time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the recent development and use of city digital twins (CDTs), massive high-quality digital assets of buildings have been created. These assets make it possible to generate high-quality and cost-effective synthetic datasets that can replace real-world ones as training sets for the supervised learning-based instance segmentation of building facades. In this study, we developed a novel framework that can automatically produce synthetic datasets from a CDT. An auto-generation system for synthetic street views was built by rendering city digital assets in a game engine, while the system auto-generated the instance annotations for building facades. The hybrid dataset HSRBFIA, along with various subsets containing different proportions of synthetic and real data, were used to train deep learning models for facade instance segmentation. In our experiments, two types of synthetic data (CDT-based and virtual-based) were compared, and the results showed that the CDT synthetic data were more effective in boosting deep learning training with real-world images compared with the virtual synthetic data (no real-world counterparts). By swapping a certain portion of the real data with the proposed CDT synthetic images, the performance could almost match what is achievable when using the real-world training set.","[Zhang, Jiaxin; Fukuda, Tomohiro; Yabuki, Nobuyoshi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Div Sustainable Energy & Environm Engn, 2-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan",Osaka University,"Fukuda, T (corresponding author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Div Sustainable Energy & Environm Engn, 2-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan.",fukuda.tomohiro.see.eng@osaka-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 21,2022,9,5,,,,,1737,1755,,10.1093/jcde/qwac086,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jcde/qwac086,,,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Multidisciplinary",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000863747100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The significant issue of semantic role identification is investigated in this study. For the Malayalam language, this paper provides a machine learning methodology for finding semantic roles. Case markers are used to identify semantic roles, which is beneficial for both syntactic and semantic analysis. To identify these relations between nouns and verbs in a sentence, case markers play an important role. This paper discusses the necessity for identifying the semantic roles in a sentence in any machine translation system.

Based on machine learning techniques, this paper proposes an approach to map perceived preferences from the local to the city level, and evaluate the physical forms and distribution characteristics of gender-specific consumption places. The application steps are: First, acquire POI (point of interest) coordinates of consumption places to obtain street-view images; then, 30 respondents of each gender are invited to score the sampled images. The area proportions of four prominent visual elements in the building facade are identified by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), after which Random Forest Model is applied to predict the preference scores of all POIs. Finally, the distribution equity of the consumption places of each gender is evaluated by Equilibrium Index. Applying this method in Beijing, we can identify the gender divergence in four aspects of form, function, scale, and administrative district, locate the area with a poor supply of consumption places, and finally provide optimisation suggestions. The method improves the efficiency and scope of measuring consumers' perceived preferences, while identifying and optimising the quality of consumption places.","[Zu, Xiaoyi; Wang, Yi] Tsinghua Univeisity, Sch Architecture, Beijing 10084, Peoples R China; [Gao, Chen] Leibniz Inst Res Soc & Space IRS, Econ & Civil Soc, Flakenstr 29-31, D-15537 Erkner, Germany; [Gao, Chen] Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, D-12489 Berlin, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Raumbezogene Sozialforschung (IRS); Humboldt University of Berlin,"Gao, C (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Res Soc & Space IRS, Econ & Civil Soc, Flakenstr 29-31, D-15537 Erkner, Germany.;Gao, C (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Geog Dept, D-12489 Berlin, Germany.",zuxy22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; chen.gao@leibniz-irs.de; wangyi@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2023,122,,,,,,,,103428,10.1016/j.jag.2023.103428,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2023.103428,,JUL 2023,,Remote Sensing,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001048479700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Power forecasting directly based on PV time series has some advantages over solar irradiance forecasting first and PV power modeling afterwards. In this paper, the power forecasting for BIPV systems in a vertical facade is studied using machine learning algorithms based on decision trees. The forecasting scheme employs the skforecast library from the Python environment, which facilitates the implementation of different schemes for both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting applications. Firstly, deterministic forecasting of hourly BIPV power was performed with XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms for different cases, showing an improvement in forecasting accuracy when some exogenous variables were used. Secondly, probabilistic forecasting was performed with XGBoost combined with the Bootstrap method. The results of this paper show the capabilities of Random Forest and gradient boosting algorithms, such as XGBoost, to work as regressors in time series forecasting of BIPV power. Mean absolute error in the deterministic forecast, using the most influencing exogenous variables, were around 40% and close below 30% for the south and east array, respectively.","[Polo, Jesus; Martin-Chivelet, Nuria; Alonso-Abella, Miguel; Sanz-Saiz, Carlos; Cuenca, Jose; de la Cruz, Marina] CIEMAT, Renewable Energy Div, Photovolta Solar Energy Unit, Avda Complutense 40, Madrid 28040, Spain","Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas, Medioambientales Tecnologicas","Polo, J (corresponding author), CIEMAT, Renewable Energy Div, Photovolta Solar Energy Unit, Avda Complutense 40, Madrid 28040, Spain.",jesus.polo@ciemat.es,,,,,,,,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2023,16,3,,,,,,,1495,10.3390/en16031495,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16031495,,,,Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000929621400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The variations in building facades' dominant colors, color harmony and diversity across different types of functional streets were examined through logistic regression and ANOVA analyses. The results indicate that, compared to industrial streets, red hues are more common in science education streets, residential streets and mixed functional streets. Business streets are more likely to have hues of green, red and red-purple. Residential streets' saturation is overall higher than that of industrial streets. In business streets, the medium-high value occurs less frequently than other streets. Moreover, we found that the street building facade colors in industrial streets were more harmonious and less diversified than that in other functional streets. This study has implications for urban color planning practices. Color harmony and color diversity should be well considered in future planning.

Building energy simulation used actual weather data and generated occupancy data. The occupancy, lighting, and equipment schedules for each zone were generated in 5-min intervals using the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory occupancy simulator. Summer electric power consumption based on Internet of Things information from the testbed building validated the model. When applying generated occupancy, lighting, and equipment schedules, the mean bias error of simulation similarly improved to 4.73%, and the coefficient of variation of the root-mean-squared error (Cv(RMSE]) improved to 12.26%.

We assume that a substantial part of the data to guide artificial design technologies resides in existing design examples. Developing ways to use this data may enable improvements in intelligent design tools, with the hope that these may provide more effective design workflows and more productive design practices. Such improvements may result in more in-depth evaluations of potentials and alternatives for design situations; hence better planning for the spatial environment. Various approaches have been developed to use representations of architectural examples for artificially tackling architectural design tasks. This study presents a review of the historical development of these approaches, with an overall aim to investigate where and how design examples have been used for practical computational design applications. The review encompasses traditional and recent Shape Grammar and Procedural Modeling studies, Case-Based Design, Similarity-Based Evaluation and Design, and recent studies on the architectural uses of Machine Vision, Semantic Modeling, Machine Learning, and Classification. The emphasis of the review is on the studies that aim at designing or generating new design examples, particularly for building layouts, facades, envelopes, and massing. For a comparative evaluation of the current capabilities of the examined lineages of studies, we propose a minimum set of design capabilities, and assess each study through this framework. This reveals the overall patterns of already covered requirements. The review shows that initial hand-operated SGs gave way to automatic generation, which in turn developed into automated SG extraction, through increasing levels of computational capabilities. Case Based Design has been neglected; however, it can be reinvigorated through novel Al techniques. On the other hand, Similarity-Based Evaluation may complement and balance the orientation towards technical performance. Machine Learning and Computer Vision appear as potential intermediaries for connecting these threads. There are example-based studies towards almost all aspects of artificial design; yet, these have not been tackled adequately or definitively. In particular, dynamic process control is still only a future potential. On the other hand, the examined research lineages have the potential to assume complementary roles for more capable and multifaceted design systems. As an overall result, example-based research perspectives raise important possibilities for intelligent design systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

By setting different scanning parameters, each MR imaging modality reflects the unique visual characteristic of scanned body part, benefiting the subsequent analysis from multiple perspectives. To utilize the complementary information from multiple imaging modalities, cross-modality MR image synthesis has aroused increasing research interest recently. However, most existing methods only focus on minimizing pixel/voxel-wise intensity difference but ignore the textural details of image content structure, which affects the quality of synthesized images. In this paper, we propose edge-aware generative adversarial networks (Ea-GANs) for cross-modality MR image synthesis. Specifically, we integrate edge information, which reflects the textural structure of image content and depicts the boundaries of different objects in images, to reduce this gap. Corresponding to different learning strategies, two frameworks are proposed, i.e., a generator-induced Ea-GAN (gEa-GAN) and a discriminator-induced Ea-GAN (dEa-GAN). The gEa-GAN incorporates the edge information via its generator, while the dEa-GAN further does this from both the generator and the discriminator so that the edge similarity is also adversarially learned. In addition, the proposed Ea-GANs are 3D-based and utilize hierarchical features to capture contextual information. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Ea-GANs, especially the dEa-GAN, outperform multiple state-of-the-art methods for cross-modality MR image synthesis in both qualitative and quantitative measures. Moreover, the dEa-GAN also shows excellent generality to generic image synthesis tasks on benchmark datasets about facades, maps, and cityscapes.","[Yu, Biting; Wang, Lei] Univ Wollongong, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Zhou, Luping] Univ Sydney, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Shi, Yinghuan] Nanjing Univ, Natl Key Lab Novel Software Technol, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Fripp, Jurgen; Bourgeat, Pierrick] CSIRO Hlth & Biosecur, Brisbane, Qld 4029, Australia",University of Wollongong; University of Sydney; Nanjing University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Wang, L (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.;Zhou, LP (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",luping.zhou@sydney.edu.au; leiw@uow.edu.au,,,,,,,,129,143,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2019,38,7,,,,,1750,1762,,10.1109/TMI.2019.2895894,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2019.2895894,,,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Biomedical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000473600100019,View Full Record in Web of Science

Especially political aggression and war conflicts have significant destructive effects on architectural and cultural heritage buildings. The post-war urbanscapes demonstrate the striking effects of the armed conflicts during the hot war encounters. However, the residues of the urbanscapes become the actual indicators of damage and loss. Since today we can make future predictions using a variety of machine learning algorithms, it is possible to represent hybrid projections of urban heterotopias. In this context, this research proposes to explore dystopian post-war projections for modern cities based on their architectural styles and demonstrate the utopian scenarios of rehabilitation possibilities for the damaged urban built environment of post-war cities by using generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithms. Two primary datasets containing the post-war and pre-war building facades have been given as the input data for the CycleGAN and pix2pix GAN models.

Besides, the machine learning process results have been discussed in terms of cities' utopian and dystopian future predictions, demonstrating the war conflicts' immense effects on the built environment.

Despite continued architectural interest on the KF to improve indoor visual comfort, its in-situ operational strategy has been little addressed. To examine our primary hypothesis that the adaptive KF controlled by AI models improves indoor daylight probability (DGP) in real time, we developed an electromagnetic hexagonal KF mechanism, and three machine-learning (ML) regressors (eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest (RFR), Decision Tree) were implemented on a Raspberry Pi board to control the KF (width = 1.73 m, height = 1.1 m). 20,000 data from Radiance were used for model construction, and illuminance sensors were installed for on-site validation in a private office mockup. The facade shape was optimally morphed every 90s, using differential evolution.

The proliferation and growing sophistication of UAV in recent years has opened up many new opportunities for damage mapping, due to the high spatial resolution, the resulting stereo images and derivatives, and the flexibility of the platform. We have addressed the problem in the context of two European research projects, RECONASS and INACHUS. In this paper we synthesize and evaluate the progress of 6 years of research focused on advanced image analysis that was driven by progress in computer vision, photogrammetry and machine learning, but also by constraints imposed by the needs of first responder and other civil protection end users. The projects focused on damage to individual buildings caused by seismic activity but also explosions, and our work centred on the processing of 3D point cloud information acquired from stereo imagery. Initially focusing on the development of both supervised and unsupervised damage detection methods built on advanced texture features and basic classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Random Forest, the work moved on to the use of deep learning. In particular the coupling of image-derived features and 3D point cloud information in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) proved successful in detecting also subtle damage features. In addition to the detection of standard rubble and debris, CNN-based methods were developed to detect typical facade damage indicators, such as cracks and spalling, including with a focus on multi-temporal and multi-scale feature fusion. We further developed a processing pipeline and mobile app to facilitate near-real time damage mapping. The solutions were tested in a number of pilot experiments and evaluated by a variety of stakeholders.","[Kerle, N.; Nex, F.; Duarte, D.] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Vetrivel, A.] Experian, Singapore 339510, Singapore",University of Twente,"Kerle, N (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat ITC, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",n.kerle@utwente.nl; f.nex@utwente.nl; d.duarte@utwente.nl; anand.vetrivel@experian.com,,,,,,,,8,9,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,42-3,W8,,,,,187,194,,10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-3-W8-187-2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-3-W8-187-2019,,,,"Geography, Physical; Management; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000684596600031,View Full Record in Web of Science

Finite element models (FEMs) can be used to compute the heat fluxes through TABEs, but the high computational cost of finite element simulations has prevented parametric studies and design optimizations. This paper proposes a domain knowledge-informed, finite element-based machine learning framework to reduce the computation cost for the energy management of buildings installed with TABE that uses a ground thermal loop. First, the training heat flux data set was generated by FEM simulations with different thermal loop schedules. Then, both shallow learning models (i.e., multivariate linear regression and eXtreme Gradient Boost, or XGBoost) and a deep learning model (i.e., deep neural network, or DNN) were trained to predict the heat fluxes. Domain knowledge was used for data preprocessing and feature selection. Finally, the suitability of the selected machine learning model was tested under different thermal loop schedules. The case study results showed that: (1) XGBoost can be as accurate as DNN (coefficient of determination equal to 0.81) with much less training time; (2) the annual energy cost savings for different thermal loop schedules obtained by the XGBoost-predicted and FEMcalculated heat fluxes are consistent, having a difference of only 4%; and (3) XGBoost can reduce the computation time for the annual energy analysis of the case study building with a given thermal loop schedule from around 12 h by using FEM to less than 1 min.","[Shen, Zhenglai; Shrestha, Som; Howard, Daniel; Hun, Diana] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Bldg & Transportat Sci Div, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA; [Feng, Tianli] Univ Utah, Dept Mech Engn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [She, Buxin] Univ Tennessee, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Shrestha, Som] Bethel Valley Rd,POB 2008 MS-6070, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Shrestha, S (corresponding author), Bethel Valley Rd,POB 2008 MS-6070, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.",shresthass@ornl.gov,,,,,,,,4,4,,,,,,,,,,,APR 15,2023,234,,,,,,,,110157,10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110157,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110157,,MAR 2023,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000962760000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The controller was trained online, and a preliminary sensitivity analysis on hyperparameters was performed to assess their influence on the agent performance. The DRL agent with the best performance was compared to a rule-based controller assumed as a baseline during a three-month heating season. The DRL controller outperformed the baseline after two weeks of deployment, with an overall performance improvement related to control of indoor temperature conditions. Moreover, the adaptability of the DRL agent was tested for various control scenarios, simulating changes of external weather conditions, indoor temperature setpoint, building envelope features and occupancy patterns. The agent dynamically deployed, despite a slight increase in energy consumption, led to an improvement of indoor temperature control, reducing the cumulative sum of temperature violations on average for all scenarios by 75% and 48% compared to the baseline and statically deployed agent respectively.","[Coraci, Davide; Brandi, Silvio; Piscitelli, Marco Savino; Capozzoli, Alfonso] Politecn Torino, Dept Energy Galileo Ferraris, BAEDA Lab, TEBE Res Grp, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin,"Capozzoli, A (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Dept Energy Galileo Ferraris, BAEDA Lab, TEBE Res Grp, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",davide.coraci@polito.it; silvio.brandi@polito.it; marco.piscitelli@polito.it; alfonso.capozzoli@polito.it,,,,,,,,19,19,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2021,14,4,,,,,,,997,10.3390/en14040997,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14040997,,,,Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000623462900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Application of artificial intelligence and drone setups in green buildings can help in providing the sustainable solution the world is striving for years. The contemporary research incorporates a novel concept of measuring the wearing thermal resistances in the building envelope with the aid of a drone system. The above procedure conducts a throughout building analysis by considering three prime environmental parameters such as wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH) and dry bulb temperature (DBT) with the aid of drone heat mapping procedure. The novelty of the study can be interpreted by the fact that prior researches have never explored the building envelope through a combination of drone and climatic conditions as variables in building areas difficult to access, thereby providing an easier, risk free, cost effective and efficient reading. Validation of the formula is authenticated by employing artificial intelligence-based software's which are applied for data prediction and optimization. Artificial models are established to validate the variables for each output from the specified number of climatic inputs. The pareto-optimal conditions attained after analysis are 44.90% RH, 12.61 degrees C DBT and 5.20 km/h WS. The variables and thermal resistance were validated with response surface methodology method, thereby presenting lowest error rate and comprehensive R-2 value, which are 0.547 and 0.97, respectively. Henceforth, employing drone-based technology in estimating building envelope discrepancies with the novel formula, yields consistent and effective assessment for development of green building, simultaneously reducing time and cost of the experimentation.","[Khan, Osama] Jamia Millia Islamia, Dept Mech Engn, New Delhi 110025, India; [Parvez, Mohd] Al Falah Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Haryana 121004, India; [Alansari, Monairah] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Math, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Farid, Mohammad] Qassim Univ, Dept Math, Deanship Educ Serv, Buraydah 51452, Saudi Arabia; [Devarajan, Yuvarajan] SIMATS, Saveetha Sch Engn, Dept Thermal Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Thanappan, Subash] Ambo Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Ambo, Ethiopia",Jamia Millia Islamia; King Abdulaziz University; Qassim University; Saveetha Institute of Medical & Technical Science; Saveetha School of Engineering; Ambo University,"Devarajan, Y (corresponding author), SIMATS, Saveetha Sch Engn, Dept Thermal Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.;Thanappan, S (corresponding author), Ambo Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Ambo, Ethiopia.",dyuvarajan2@gmail.com; subash.thanappan@ambou.edu.et,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 21,2023,13,1,,,,,,,8200,10.1038/s41598-023-35245-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-35245-x,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000993254000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most of reconstruction strategies are based on geometric feature extraction, which is categorized into two groups: point-based and segmentation-based boundary extraction. However, little attention was paid on further recognizing and separating those extracted geometric features, result of which is helpful for 3D building modeling at LOD3. This paper presents an approach to recognize 3D facade features automatically from TSL data based on heuristic knowledge of geometrical and topological configuration of facade objects. All the facade knowledge is stored in a hierarchical tree, which guides the classification process.

Based on forecast precipitation, topography, and pipe networks, flood simulations can provide early warnings for areas and buildings at risk of flooding. Basement windows, doors, and underground garage entrances are common places where floodwater can flow into a building. Some buildings have been prepared or designed considering the threat of flooding, but others have not. Therefore, knowing the heights of these facade openings helps to identify places that are more susceptible to water ingress. However, such data is not yet readily available in most cities. Traditional surveying of the desired targets may be used, but this is a very time-consuming and laborious process. Instead, mobile mapping using LiDAR (light detection and ranging) is an efficient tool to obtain a large amount of high-density 3D measurement data. To use this method, it is required to extract the desired facade openings from the data in a fully automatic manner. This research presents a new process for the extraction of windows and doors from LiDAR mobile mapping data. Deep learning object detection models are trained to identify these objects. Usually, this requires to provide large amounts of manual annotations. In this paper, we mitigate this problem by leveraging a rule-based method. In a first step, the rule-based method is used to generate pseudo-labels. A semi-supervised learning strategy is then applied with three different levels of supervision. The results show that using only automatically generated pseudo-labels, the learning-based model outperforms the rule-based approach by 14.6% in terms of F1-score. After five hours of human supervision, it is possible to improve the model by another 6.2%. By comparing the detected facade openings' heights with the predicted water levels from a flood simulation model, a map can be produced which assigns per-building flood risk levels. Thus, our research provides a new geographic information layer for fine-grained urban emergency response. This information can be combined with flood forecasting to provide a more targeted disaster prevention guide for the city's infrastructure and residential buildings. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to achieve such a large scale, fine-grained building flood risk mapping.","[Feng, Yu; Xiao, Qing; Brenner, Claus; Feuerhake, Udo; Sester, Monika] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Cartog & Geoinformat, Appelstr 9a, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Peche, Aaron] Bpi Hannover Beratende Ingn, Mengendamm 16d, D-30177 Hannover, Germany; [Peche, Aaron] Fed Inst Geosci & Nat Resources, D-30655 Hannover, Germany; [Yang, Juntao] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geomat, Qingdao 266590, Peoples R China; [Yang, Juntao] China Univ Geosci, Sch Land Sci & Technol, 29 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",Leibniz University Hannover; Shandong University of Science & Technology; China University of Geosciences,"Feng, Y (corresponding author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Cartog & Geoinformat, Appelstr 9a, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",yu.feng@ikg.uni-hannover.de,,,,,,,,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2022,93,,,,,,,,101759,10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2022.101759,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2022.101759,,FEB 2022,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Studies; Geography; Operations Research & Management Science; Regional & Urban Planning",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000754069600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

After texture fusion, the line segment detector (LSD) algorithm is used to extract the structural features from the building facade images, and random sample consensus (RANSAC) is used to improve the continuity of structural features. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated by comparing results with the state-of-the-art methods, such as LSD, MLSD, CannyLines, and MCMLSD.

A Positive Energy Building (PEB) model has been developed by the European Union as part of Horizon 2020 to contribute to a cleaner neighborhood environment. To achieve PEB goals, a variety of factors must be optimized, including occupant comfort, building efficiency, economic benefits, and clean energy provision. Building modeling simulation combined with data-driven tools such as machine learning and artificial intelligence can be used to predict energy production and optimize passive and active systems. Based on these findings, this study evaluates studies from the past decade that include data-driven approaches, which accelerate different aspects of PEB, including supply and demand. These aspects include renewable energy supply prediction with the local context, optimizing comfort control with IoT, and reducing demand by optimizing building envelope design, materials selection, and active systems. While there are a few surveys regarding renewable energy management and energy efficiency in buildings, none simultaneously classified the algorithms in a PEB framework. Hence, this work inherently creates a technical framework for future researchers and building engineers to apply the appropriate data-driven approach for achieving net positive energy performance in residential, educational, and commercial buildings.

However, evaluating the performance of these AFs using the current building performance simulation (BPS) tools is complex, time-consuming, and computationally intensive. These limitations can be overcome by using a machine learning (ML) model as a method to assess the AF system efficiently during the early design stage. This study presents an alternative approach using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that can predict the hourly cooling loads of AF in significantly less time compared to BPS. To construct the model, a generative parametric simulation of office tower spaces with an AF shading system were simulated in terms of energy consumption using Honeybee add-on in Grasshopper which are linked to EnergyPlus for training the ANN model. The prediction results showed a highly accurate model that can estimate cooling loads within seconds.","[Alammar, Ammar; Jabi, Wassim] Cardiff Univ, Welsh Sch Architecture, Bute Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff, Wales",Cardiff University,"Alammar, A (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Welsh Sch Architecture, Bute Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff, Wales.",alammara@cardiff.ac.uk; jabiw@cardiff.ac.uk,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2022,,,,,,,656,669,,,,,,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Mathematics, Applied",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000861385300056,View Full Record in Web of Science

The mathematical spatial tiling formalism is related to the shape grammar formalism to illustrate commonalties between the two approaches to spatial design generation. Computational encoding of a mathematical tiling description as a basic grammar creates a generative design tool that can be used to study the visual properties of the spatial tiling and assess its potential for interesting use in design. The generative system is then relaxed by moving to an unrestricted grammar that expands the generative power to explore alternate design viewpoints and illustrate advantages of encoding a spatial tiling as a shape grammar.

Despite its importance, a thermal anomaly is still usually detected by manual analysis of IRT, which strongly depends on the analyzer?s experience. In this study, an automatic anomaly detection framework from thermal and visible images was developed. The wall, which is the subject of anomaly detection, is segmented from the visible image by a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). The temperature threshold of the anomaly area is determined from the multimodal temperature distribution of the target domain. The performance of the anomaly detection was improved by applying the segmentation process (F1 score 0.497 to 0.808). The framework proposed in this study is expected to be implemented through portable devices and enable instant in-situ thermal anomaly detection.","[Park, Gwanyong; Lee, Minhyung; Jang, Hyangin; Kim, Changmin] Inst Green Bldg & New Technol, Mirae Environm Plan, Seoul 01905, South Korea",,"Kim, C (corresponding author), Inst Green Bldg & New Technol, Mirae Environm Plan, Seoul 01905, South Korea.",kcm@mrplan.co.kr,,,,,,,,16,16,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2021,125,,,,,,,,103627,10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103627,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103627,,FEB 2021,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000649683600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

For predicting masonry responses to seismic events in particular, equivalent frame models-a subcategory of macro-element models-are a common choice because of their low computational cost. However, an existing bottleneck in modeling pipelines is generating the geometry of the model, which is currently a slow and laborious process that is done manually using computer-aided design tools. In this paper, we address this by automating the modelling process using recent advancements in computer vision and machine learning. We present an image-based end-to-end pipeline that automatically generates finite element meshes for solid-element and equivalent-frame models of the outer walls of free-standing historical masonry buildings. As the input, our framework requires RGB images of the buildings that are processed using structure-from-motion algorithms, which create 3D geometries, and convolutional neural networks, which segment the openings and their corners. These layers are then combined to generate level of detail models. We tested our pipeline on structures with irregular surface geometries and opening layouts. While generating the solid element mesh from the level of detail model is straightforward, generating equivalent frame models required algorithms for segmenting the facade and the meshing. Experts in the field analyzed the generated equivalent frame models and determined them to be useful for numerical modeling. These finite element geometries will be invaluable for future predictions of the seismic response of damaged and undamaged buildings. The codes and dataset are publicly available for future studies and benchmarking ( and ).","[Pantoja-Rosero, Bryan German; Beyer, Katrin] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Earthquake Engn & Struct Dynam Lab EESD, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Achanta, Radhakrishna] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Swiss Data Sci Ctr SDSC, ETHz, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Beyer, K (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Earthquake Engn & Struct Dynam Lab EESD, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",bryan.pantojarosero@epfl.ch; radhakrishna.achanta@epfl.ch; katrin.beyer@epfl.ch,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,2023 JUN 29,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10518-023-01726-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10518-023-01726-7,,JUN 2023,,"Engineering, Geological; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001022073500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A better understanding of building energy efficiency is beneficial for reducing overall household energy use and providing guidance for future housing improvement and retrofit. In this research, we propose a deep learning-based multi-source data fusion framework to estimate building energy efficiency. We consider the traditional factors associated with the building energy efficiency from the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for 160,000 properties (30,000 buildings) in Glasgow, UK (e.g., property structural attributes and morphological attributes), as well as the Google Street View (GSV) building facade images as a complement. We compare the performance improvements between our data-fusion framework with traditional morphological attributes and image-only models. The results show that including the building facade images from GSV, the overall model accuracy increases from 79.7% to 86.8%. A further investigation and explanation of the deep learning model are conducted to understand the relationships between building features and building energy efficiency by using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).

In contrast to such facade solutions, responsive facade systems with embedded sensing, actuation, and control systems have been proven to perform with up to 65% higher efficiency by being able to adapt their physical characters, such as orientation, and material property in real-time as a response to fluctuating environmental conditions (visual and thermal) and user preferences. Advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning processes further aid such responsive facade systems to optimize multiple parameters such as illuminance level and the associated lighting energy, visual discomfort caused by solar glare, solar heat gain, thermal resistance (heating energy and comfort level), and natural ventilation simultaneously. This research investigates the case of a real-time adaptive Building Integrated Photo Voltaic (BIPV) shading system and its ability (in comparison with traditional static building integrated photo voltaic facade systems) to perform as regards visual comfort and energy generation potential simultaneously within the humid subtropical climate of Sydney, Australia. A simulated case scenario wherein a real-time adaptive building integrated photo voltaic shading systems is deployed on a typical multistorey building facade in Sydney, Australia is accordingly presented. The conducted simulation considers the responsive building integrated photo voltaic system as a double-skin facade system and uses multi-objective evolutionary computing principles to decipher its integrability potential. A comparative analysis between traditional static mounted Photo Voltaic (PV) systems as opposed to multi-objective optimization driven real-time adaptive building integrated photo voltaic shading configurations is subsequently presented.

Various building energy efficiency policies have been issued in many cities around the US, requiring the disclosure of buildings' energy performance and encourage building owners to take this information into consideration for retrofit investment decisions. However, various types of building information at different scales are meant to be collected and disclosed with costs that have substantial variations accordingly. Hence, complying with these policies is expensive and time-consuming for both government agencies and building owners. This paper proposes a non-intrusive and scalable data-driven approach to automatically capture energy-critical building characteristics to declare energy benchmarking or retrofitting policies. This approach first integrated open city data sets (building-related) and identified principal building variables in relation to energy performance indexes (i.e., electricity usage), then utilized transfer learning to retrain deep learning models on building facade images (retrieved from Google Street View) to extract their corresponding principal building variables. To elaborate, given a fully captured facade image of any building, this approach provides the data values for the identified principal variables (e.g., for a facade image given as an input, the outputs will include buildingType = Office). The best accuracy of the extraction model exceeds 80% in extracting building types from images, which indicates that the model is capable of extracting data values for the principal building variables that are essential for energy performance of buildings.","[Yu, Xinran; Ergan, Semiha] NYU, Dept Civil & Urban Engn, Brooklyn, NY 10003 USA",New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering,"Yu, XR (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Civil & Urban Engn, Brooklyn, NY 10003 USA.",celiayu@nyu.edu; semiha@nyu.edu,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2022,,,,,,,131,139,,,,,,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000948933100017,View Full Record in Web of Science

The data were further processed in photogrammetric software in order to generate a georeferenced orthofacade. Crack detection was performed at pixel level via computer code using the OpenCV library methods. The established diagnostic model, defined by control points, enables precise determination of crack location. Crack length, width, or area could be calculated based on the coordinates of its points, by performing simple mathematical operations.

Automatic processing of MLS point clouds for feature extraction on building facades is a demanding work. Point cloud segmentation and recognition are the most important steps in this context. In this paper, a new approach for automatic and fast processing of MLS data for the detection of building patches while restricting to segment other features is introduced. After filtering of the point clouds, the building facade extraction takes place. An initial building point cluster detection and roughness based point separation within the cluster itself are the preliminary stages of this process. Thereafter points are segmented into planar patches based on the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) technique, as most facades are dominated by planar faces. An intelligent seed point selection method is introduced, and growing rules are applied in order to extract the most significant planar features which represent the building facades. Each segmented plane is afterwards processed to recognize the facade features. A rule based partitioning tree, constructed from the 2D geometric knowledge of building features is used for facade feature recognition. The approach has been tested with several urban data sets, and results demonstrate that the method can be applied in an efficient modelling process.","[Arachchige, Nalani Hetti; Perera, Sanka Nirodha; Maas, Hans-Gerd] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, D-01069 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Arachchige, NH (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Helmholtz Str 10, D-01069 Dresden, Germany.",hetti_arachchige.nalani@mailbox.tu-dresden.de; sanka.perera@mailbox.tu-dresden.de; hans-gerd.maas@tu-dresden.de,,,,,,,,13,14,,,,,,,,,,,,2012,39-B5,,,,,,187,192,,,,,,,"Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000358240300032,View Full Record in Web of Science

With existing deep learning-based approaches, image completion results in high quality but may still lack high-level feature details or contain artificial appearance. In our completion architecture, we leverage a fully convolutional generator with two subnetworks as our basic completion approach and divide the problem into two steps: The first subnetwork generates the outline of a completed image in a new domain, and the second subnetwork translates the outline to a visually realistic output with image-to-image translation.

Different from previous state-of-the-art lattice detection algorithms for near-regular wallpaper patterns, our proposed method can detect multiple, semantically relevant 2D lattices in a scene simultaneously, achieving an effective translation-symmetry-based segmentation.

While this problem is well-studied in the literature, most of the existing studies are either qualitative or minimally driven quantitative studies that rely on localized building envelope points and are, thus, not suitable for automated solutions in energy audit applications. This research work is an attempt to fill this gap of knowledge by utilizing intensive thermal data (on the order of 100,000 plus images) and constitutes a relatively new area of analysis in energy audit applications. Specifically, we demonstrate a novel process using deep-learning methods to segment more than 100,000 thermal images collected from an unmanned aerial system (UAS). To quantify the heat loss for a building envelope, multiple stages of computations need to be performed: object detection (using Mask-RCNN/Faster R-CNN), estimating the surface temperature (using two clustering methods), and finally calculating the overall heat transfer coefficient (e.g., the U-value). The proposed model was applied to eleven academic campuses across the state of North Dakota. The preliminary findings indicate that Mask R-CNN outperformed other instance segmentation models with an mIOU of 73% for facades, 55% for windows, 67% for roofs, 24% for doors, and 11% for HVACs. Two clustering methods, namely K-means and threshold-based clustering (TBC), were deployed to estimate surface temperatures with TBC providing consistent estimates across all times of the day over K-means. Our analysis demonstrated that thermal efficiency not only depended on the accurate acquisition of thermal images but also relied on other factors, such as the building geometry and seasonal weather parameters, such as the outside/inside building temperatures, wind, time of day, and indoor heating/cooling conditions. Finally, the resultant U-values of various building envelopes were compared with recommendations from the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) building standards.","[Arjoune, Youness; Peri, Sai; Sugunaraj, Niroop; Biswas, Avhishek; Sadhukhan, Debanjan; Ranganathan, Prakash] Univ North Dakota UND, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Grand Forks, ND 58201 USA; [Arjoune, Youness; Sugunaraj, Niroop; Biswas, Avhishek; Ranganathan, Prakash] 243 Centennial Dr Stop 8155, Grand Forks, ND 58201 USA",,"Peri, S (corresponding author), Univ North Dakota UND, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Grand Forks, ND 58201 USA.",youness.arjoune@und.edu; sai.peri@und.edu; niroop.sugunaraj@und.edu; avhishek.biswas@und.edu; debanjan.sadhukhan1987@gmail.com; prakash.ranganathan@und.edu,,,,,,,,2,3,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2021,21,13,,,,,,,4375,10.3390/s21134375,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s21134375,,,,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000671152300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Further, the point cloud is sliced along the three coordinate axes after adjusting the point-cloud attitude of the building to ensure that its orientation is consistent with the Y-coordinate axis.

This paper presents a novel approach that combines photogrammetry and deep learning techniques to address the problem of BIPV decarbonization. The method is called BIM-AITIZATION referring to the integration of BIM data, AI techniques, and automation principles. It integrates photogrammetric data into practical BIM parameters. In addition, it enhances the precision and reliability of PV energy prediction by using artificial intelligence strategies. The primary aim of this approach is to offer advanced, data-driven energy forecasts and BIPV decarbonization while fully automating the underlying process. To achieve this, the first step is to capture point cloud data of the building through photogrammetric acquisition. This data undergoes preprocessing to identify and remove unwanted points, followed by plan segmentation to extract the plan facade. After that, a meteorological dataset is assembled, incorporating various attributes that influence energy production, including solar irradiance parameters as well as BIM parameters. Finally, machine and deep learning techniques are used for accurate photovoltaic energy predictions and the automation of the entire process. Extensive experiments are conducted, including multiple tests aimed at assessing the performance of diverse machine learning models. The objective is to identify the most suitable model for our specific application. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is undertaken, comparing the performance of the proposed model against that of various established BIPV software tools.

Extracting facade features from three-dimensional (3D) point cloud data (3D PCD) is an efficient method for 3D building modeling. By combining the advantages of 3D PCD and two-dimensional optical images, this study describes the creation of a highly accurate building facade feature extraction method from 3D PCD with a focus on structural information. The new extraction method involves three major steps: image feature extraction, exploration of the mapping method between the image features and 3D PCD, and optimization of the initial 3D PCD facade features considering structural information. Results show that the new method can extract the 3D PCD facade features of buildings more accurately and continuously. The new method is validated using a case study. In addition, the effectiveness of the new method is demonstrated by comparing it with the range image-extraction method and the optical image-extraction method in the absence of structural information. The 3D PCD facade features extracted by the new method can be applied in many fields, such as 3D building modeling and building information modeling.

In contrast to general object detection, the spatial arrangement regularity and appearance similarity between the facade elements of the same category provide valuable context for accurate element localization. In this paper, we propose to exploit the spatial arrangement regularity and appearance similarity of facade elements in a detection framework. Our element-arrangement context network (EACNet) consists of two unidirectional attention branches, one to capture the column-context and the other to capture row-context to aggregate element-specific features from multiple instances on the facade. We conduct extensive experiments on four public datasets (ECP, CMP, Graz50, and eTRIMS). The proposed EACNet achieves the highest mIoU (82.1% on ECP, 77.35% on Graz50, and 82.3% on eTRIMS) compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

The newly developed model includes three main components: a simulation model, a predictive model, and an optimization model. The simulation model simulates the building's energy performance, considering different values for various envelope parameters. The predictive model employs machine learning algorithms, including RF, ANN, DNN, SVM, GENLIN, and GB (in which GB has been identified as the most suitable algorithm), boasting a very high R2(0.994) to assess energy consumption. The optimization model which uses AI optimization algorithms (such as NSGA II, DSE, and MOPSO) integrates the machine learning predictive model into the evaluation function during the evolutionary process, efficiently searching for Pareto-optimal building envelope solutions. Results show simultaneous savings in cost and energy, with savings of 7.52 % in cost and 8.48 % in energy, or 21.17 % in cost and 0.4 % in energy, for a case study in Vietnam.

An extensive body of existing research investigates such methods, but benchmarking is limited and it is often unclear whether the approaches are scalable and robust to diverse building properties. Machine learning approaches, which natively handle complex, multivariate datasets, are rarely applied in this domain. This paper benchmarks seven different methods for characterization of the whole-building heat loss coefficient, including traditional gray box and novel black box approaches. To do so, a dataset of 16,000 simulated buildings is created. The models are benchmarked against ground truth, including an assessment of robustness to climate, construction materials, air-infiltration rate and occupant behaviour. We show the deep learning methods outperform other approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness, but that all of the approaches have limitations that restrain their practical usage. Based on this result, we suggest that further research is required to develop reliable and scalable approaches for the characteri-zation of quantitative envelope properties from sensor data.

A camera-equipped UAV system can capture numerous high-resolution facade images for close-up visual inspections. However, in several cases, the multispectrum and spatiotemporal data collected by UAVs are not systematically documented and utilized, which obstructs the automation in the identification, localization, assessment, and tracking of facade anomalies. This paper develops an integrated, computational GIS-based information system to provide automated storage, retrieval, detection, assessment, and documentation of facade anomalies based on UAV-captured data. The developed system creates user-friendly access to diverse professional imagery analysis tools from external artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. A real-world case was studied to present the procedure and advances in the management and analysis of multisourced inspection data to automate UAV-based facade diagnosis. As a result, the proposed method facilitates the seamless fusion, processing, visualization, and documentation of multimodal inspection data, resulting in convenient analysis with discrepancies measured in decimeters for length, millimeters for width, and centimeters for geoposition.

However, traditional approaches to understand styles and their evolution require domain expertise, fieldwork and extensive manual processes. Recent research in deep learning and computer vision has highlighted the great potential in analyzing urban environments from images. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework for understanding architectural styles and age epochs by deciphering building facades based on street-level imagery. The frame-work is composed of two stages: Deep 'Learning' the architecture and Deep 'Interpreting' the architecture age epochs and styles. In Deep 'Learning', a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model is designed to automatically learn about the age characteristics of building facades from street view images. In Deep 'Inter-preting' stage, three components are proposed to understand the different perspectives regarding building ages and styles. In the experiment, a building age epoch dataset is compiled for the city of Amsterdam and Stockholm to understand the evolution of architectural element styles and the relationship between building ages and styles spatially and temporally. This research illustrates how publicly available data and deep learning could be used to trace the evolution of architectural styles in the spatial-temporal domain.","[Sun, Maoran; Zhang, Fan; Duarte, Fabio; Ratti, Carlo] MIT, Senseable City Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Zhang, F (corresponding author), MIT, Senseable City Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",zhangfan@link.cuhk.edu.hk,,,,,,,,26,27,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2022,128,,,,,,,,103787,10.1016/j.cities.2022.103787,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2022.103787,,JUN 2022,,Urban Studies,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000812045100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The paper presents an algorithmic concept that increases the quality of tomographic images showing the distribution of moisture inside the walls. The method solves the problem of monitoring the dampness of historical buildings and walls susceptible to moisture. The research focuses on solving the inverse problem of converting electrical measurements into spatial images. The study used a proprietary electrical impedance tomography system with specially designed electrodes. The measurement vector is converted to images in two stages. In the first stage, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was used, which generates raw reconstructions. The task of the second LSTM network is to convert the raw images obtained in the first stage into enhanced images. The application of the presented method is not limited to one type of narrow-sphere tomography. The two-stage approach can be easily adapted to, e.g., medical and industrial or process tomography.

Traditional damage detection techniques using 2D features at a single observing angle cannot objectively and accurately reflect the structural damage conditions. With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle photogrammetric techniques and 3D point processing, automatic and accurate damage detection for building roof and facade has become a research hotspot in recent work. In this paper, we propose a building damage detection framework based on the boundary refined supervoxel segmentation and random forest-latent Dirichlet allocation classification. First, the traditional supervoxel segmentation method is improved to segment the point clouds into good boundary refined supervoxels. Then, non-building points such as ground and vegetation are removed from the generated supervoxels. Next, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model is used to construct the high-level feature representation for each building supervoxel based on the selected 2D image and 3D point features. Finally, LDA model and random forest algorithm are employed to identify the damaged building regions. This method is applied to oblique photogrammetric point clouds collected from the Beichuan Country Earthquake Site. The research achieves the 3D damage assessment for building facade and roof. The result demonstrates that the proposed framework is capable of achieving around 94% accuracy for building point extraction and around 90% accuracy for damage identification. Moreover, both of the precision and recall for building damage detection reached around 89%. Concluded from comparison analysis, the proposed method improved the damage detection accuracy and the highest improvement ratio is over 8%.","[Liu, Chaoxian; Sui, Haigang; Huang, Lihong] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Sui, HG (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.",cx_leo@whu.edu.cn; 00201543@whu.edu.cn; lhhuang1018@whu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2020,20,22,,,,,,,6499,10.3390/s20226499,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s20226499,,,,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000595204300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The images were captured inside an architectural model aimed at exploring the impact of shading panels on photobiological lighting parameters. The architectural model represents a generic space at 1:10 scale with a single side fully glazing facade used to install shading panels. The datasets present interior lighting conditions under different shading configurations in terms of surface colors and glossiness, horizontal and vertical orientations and upwards, downwards, and left/right inclinations of panels, V-shape opening, low to high densities, and top and bottom positions at the window. The experiments of shading panel configurations were conducted under four to six different exterior overcast daylighting conditions simulated with very cool to very warm color temperatures and high to low intensities inside an artificial sky chamber. The datasets include bracketed low dynamic range (LDR) images which enable generating high dynamic range (HDR) images for photobiological lighting evaluations. Images were captured from the side and back viewpoints inside the model by using Raspberry Pi camera modules mounted with fisheye lenses. The datasets are reusable and useful for architects, lighting designers, and building engineers to study the impact of architectural variables and shading panels on photobiological lighting conditions in space. The datasets will also be interesting for computer vision specialists to run machine learning techniques and train artificial intelligence for architectural applications.

Among those techniques, reinforcement learning has been shown as particularly effective at reducing the dimensionality of some real problems and solving control problems by learning from experience. The use of thermal energy storage active systems in the building sector is identified as suitable option to reduce their energy demand for heating and cooling. However, these systems might be expensive and require appropriate control strategies in order to improve the performance of the building. In this paper a ventilated facade with PCM is controlled using a reinforcement learning algorithm. The ventilated facade uses mechanical ventilation during nighttime to solidify the PCM and releases this cold stored to the inner environment during the peak demand period. It is crucial to decide correctly the schedule of charge and discharge process of the PCM according to the weather and indoor conditions. An experimentally validated numerical model is used to test the performance of the control algorithm under different weather conditions. Important improvements on the energy savings due to the use of control strategies were found and supported by the data under the different tested climatic conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed method first generates the georeferenced feature image of a mobile LiDAR point cloud and then uses image segmentation to extract contour areas which contain facade points of buildings, points of trees, and points of other objects in the georeferenced feature image. After all the points in each contour area are extracted, a classification based on principal component analysis (PCA) method is adopted to identify building objects from point clouds extracted in contour areas. Then, all the points in a building object are segmented into different planes using the random sample consensus algorithm. For each building, points in facade planes are chosen to calculate the direction, the start point, and the end point of the facade footprints using PCA. Finally, footprints of different facades of building are refined, harmonized, and joined. Two data sets of downtown areas and one data set of a residential area captured by Optech's LYNX mobile mapping system were tested to verify the validities of the proposed method.

Review papers on these methods, applied in situ and in laboratory, have been published, focusing on theory, equipment, metrological performance, test conditions and data acquisition, data analysis, benefits, and limitations. However, steps forward have been done and not been deepened in previous works: in fact, the representative points method and the weighted area method have been proposed, too, whilst artificial intelligence and data-driven methods have begun to prove the reliability also in the U-value prevision using available datasets. Considering this context, this work aims at updating the literature background considering exclusively in situ methods. The work starts from bibliometric and scientometric analysis not previously conducted: this helped to group the methods and to sketch the innovations and the future perspectives. Indeed, from the bibliometric and scientometric literature analysis what emerged was (i) the richness of the background on this topic, especially in the recent years, (ii) two macro-groups (methods with and without measurements), and (iii) the importance of paper keywords (otherwise, interesting papers are eluded by the output of simple database queries). The method study that followed aims at providing (i) a broader view of the thermal transmittance (U-value) assessment procedures, including the utmost recent applications, proposal, and outlooks in this field, (ii) the understanding on the fundamental theories of the techniques, (iii) practical advice for building-envelope assessment, focusing on the advantages and limitations useful for professionals and researchers involved in the energy audit, conservation, or refurbishment of building stock, (iv) the identification of the interconnection between the techniques that often rely on one another, and (v) final remarks and future perspective of the procedures, which embrace the use of artificial intelligence (AI). From the topic analysis, as a result, it emerged that this is an open field for future research, especially with the implementation of AI, which requires good datasets and trials on the models' architectures, in terms of input layer, number of hidden layer and neurons, and percentage of data to be employed for model training and testing.","[Nardi, Iole] ENEA Casaccia Res Ctr, I-00123 Rome, Italy; [Lucchi, Elena] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture, Built Environm & Construction Engn DABC, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Lucchi, E (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture, Built Environm & Construction Engn DABC, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",iole.nardi@enea.it; elena.lucchi@polimi.it,,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2023,16,8,,,,,,,3319,10.3390/en16083319,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16083319,,,,Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000977126100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although the literature in this field has focused on investigating critical factors in energy consumption, only a few studies have conducted a quantitative sensitivity analysis for thermal occupant factors (TOF) (i.e., metabolic rate and clothing level). Therefore, this paper introduces a framework for testing the criticality of TOF with a cross-comparison against building-related factors, considering the constraint of occupant thermal comfort. Using a building energy simulation model, the energy consumption of a case study is simulated, and building energy model alternatives are generated. The scope includes TOF and building envelope factors, with an established orthogonal experimental design. A popular branch of machine learning (ML) called linear genetic programming (LGP) is used to analyse the generated data from the experiment. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted using the developed LGP model to determine and rank the criticality of the considered factors. The findings reveal that occupants' metabolic rate and clothing level have relevancy factors of -0.48 and -0.38 respectively, which ranked them 2nd and 3rd against building envelope factors for achieving energy-efficient comfortable houses. This research contributes to the literature by introducing a framework that couples orthogonal experiment design with ML techniques to quantify the criticality of TOF and rank them against building-envelope factors.","[Alsharif, Rashed; Arashpour, Mehrdad; Golafshani, Emadaldin Mohammad; Chang, Victor; Zhou, Jenny] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Alsharif, Rashed] Umm Al Qura Univ, Dept Construct Engn Al Qunfudah, Mecca, Saudi Arabia; [Hosseini, M.

However, the application of TILT features in computer vision has been severely limited by two major problems. First, TILT feature representation is based on the assumption that the given image contains only one dominant low-rank region, which typically does not hold in natural images. Second, when multiple low-rank regions are present, the existing TILT detection methods either randomly sample the image or apply to fixed grid coordinates, both of which cannot guarantee good recovery of salient low-rank image features. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to address these two important issues. First, utilizing superpixels and the concept of canonical rank derived from TILT, we introduce a method to segment natural images into a geometric layer and a non-geometric layer. Second, we apply a Markov random field model to a multiscale low-rank representation of the image geometric layer, and obtain an effective algorithm to detect TILT features. Finally, we present an application of the multiscale TILT detection algorithm to the classical problem of building facade segmentation. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Pankrac building database to demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithms.","[Lam, Chi-Pang; Yang, Allen Y.; Elhamifar, Ehsan; Sastry, S.

In contrast to roof surfaces, facades can not directly be reconstructed in a similar high level of quality from this data. Distortions of perspective might appear in images, due to the camera angle. Occlusions and shadowing occur as well. Objects, such as windows and doors, will have to be detected on such data if facades are to be reconstructed. Although one can use inpainting techniques to cover occluded areas, detection results are often incomplete and noisy. Formal grammars can then be used to align and add objects. However, it is difficult to find suitable rules for all types of buildings. We propose a post-processing approach based on neural networks to improve facade layouts. To this end, we applied existing Recurrent Neural Network architectures like Multi-Dimensional Long Short-term Memory Network and Quasi Recurrent Neural Network in a new context. We also propose a novel architecture, the Rotated Multi-Dimensional Long Short Term Memory.

Each of these metrics is inspired from the way advertisers may want to view segmentation results within an AR world editor, or the way users may want to experience AR advertisements.

The motivation is to render more accessible the exploration of the generative aspect of bottom up design techniques when coupled with optimization and performance criteria. The objective of the work is to develop and test a design methodology, which enables designers to explore larger sets of informed solutions by coupling design requirements and generative design techniques with validated simulations (i.e., environmental analysis) based partly on the inclusion of user light preferences early in the design process. The development of the proposed methodology and the implementation of the design system for a building facade are described, while the robustness and validity of the framework is initially tested by applying it to the generation and optimization of facade panel configurations of an office building. The results show that the MAS for design system can generate unique design configurations that perform environmentally (daylight factor analysis) better than a facade with normative facade shading.

This paper aims to evaluate the feasibility and applicability of gradient boosting machines in estimating the energy savings of different facade alternatives in the early-stage design of building facades. The energy performance of two competing facade systems was estimated for different scenarios using building energy simulations (i.e. EnergyPlus (TM)). Three gradient boosting machines were developed based on the data collected from the simulation of thirteen building types in fifteen different locations (i.e. 195 scenarios). The prediction performance of gradient boosting models was compared with the building energy simulation results of two new building models that were not used in the database development phase to validate the models. Moreover, the prediction power of the trained gradient boosting models was compared with three common prediction models (i.e. Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, and Generalized Linear Regression) based on several performance metrics. The results showed the superiority of gradient boosting machines over other models in estimating total site energy savings, heating energy savings, and buildings' cooling energy savings.","[Abediniangerabi, B.] Texas A&M Univ Commerce, Dept Engn & Technol, Commerce, TX USA; [Makhmalbaf, A.] Univ Texas Arlington, Sch Architecture, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Shahandashti, M.] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Civil Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University Commerce; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Abediniangerabi, B (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Civil Engn, 416 S Yates St, Arlington, TX 76010 USA.",bahram.abediniangerabi@uta.edu,,,,,,,,4,5,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 4,2022,16,4,,,,,542,567,,10.1080/17512549.2021.2011410,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17512549.2021.2011410,,DEC 2021,,Construction & Building Technology,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000725431000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The proposed approach is established by ensembles of Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system, named as ANFIS-ESM, with random subspace (RSE), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), random linear oracle (RLO), and stacking (STE) strategies. An experimental dataset which consists of 510 historical records and 12 conditioning factors has been collected for this research. Pre-training and post-training analyses on the importance of factors have also been performed by means of mutual information, ReliefF, and Fourier amplitude sensitivity test. Importantly, experimental results point out that STE strategy has attained the most accurate outcome with a classification accuracy rate (CAR) of 87.76% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91. Moreover, the proposed ensemble framework has outperformed other benchmark models including the support vector machine, the random forest, and the rotation forest.

We tackle this problem by combining the strengths of two popular domains: sketch-based modeling and procedural modeling. On the one hand, sketch-based modeling exploits our ability to draw but requires detailed, unambiguous drawings to achieve complex models. On the other hand, procedural modeling automates the creation of precise and detailed geometry but requires the tedious definition and parameterization of procedural models. Our system uses a collection of simple procedural grammars, called snippets, as building blocks to turn sketches into realistic 3D models. We use a machine learning approach to solve the inverse problem of finding the procedural model that best explains a user sketch. We use nonphotorealistic rendering to generate artificial data for training convolutional neural networks capable of quickly recognizing the procedural rule intended by a sketch and estimating its parameters. We integrate our algorithm in a coarse-to-fine urban modeling system that allows users to create rich buildings by successively sketching the building mass, roof, facades, windows, and ornaments. A user study shows that by using our approach non-expert users can generate complex buildings in just a few minutes.","[Nishida, Gen; Garcia-Dorado, Ignacio; Aliaga, Daniel G.; Benes, Bedrich] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Bousseau, Adrien] Inria, Rocquencourt, France",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Inria,"Nishida, G (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,,,,,,93,107,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2016,35,4,,,,,,,130,10.1145/2897824.2925951,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2897824.2925951,,,,"Computer Science, Software Engineering",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000380112400100,View Full Record in Web of Science

It requires not only favorable modeling methods, but also attention to the intrinsic cause analysis of loads. However, most previous studies have focused more on the improvement of forecasting algorithms, lacking the comprehensive analysis and scientific research from the load formation mechanism. To address this, a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-driven forecasting method integrating building thermal load characteristics, is proposed. This modeling approach takes into account both strong reflection ability of resistance-capacitance (RC) for the thermo-physical characteristics of building envelope and the superior handling capability of dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) for occupant uncertainties. Therewith, the independent building enve-lope model and occupant behavior model are established. Coupling the predicted values of these two sub-models, the building total load forecasting model is established using fuzzy radial basis function (RBF) neural network. A case study of an office building in Tianjin is utilized to validate the proposed method, revealing excellent predictive performance for both the sub-models and the total load model. The proposed method can effectively predict thermal load both from the for-mation mechanism of internal and external disturbances. It was found that the AI-driven model incorporating building thermal load characteristics, achieves significantly higher precision compared to the general data-driven model, with a reduction of 14.74% in coefficient of variation of root mean squared error in summer and 59.78% in winter.","[Zhao, Jing; Yuan, Xiulian; Duan, Yaoqi; Li, Haonan; Liu, Dehan] Tianjin Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Tianjin Key Lab Built Environm & Energy Applicat, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Tianjin University,"Zhao, J (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Tianjin Key Lab Built Environm & Energy Applicat, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",zhaojing@tju.edu.cn,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 15,2023,79,,,,,,,,107855,10.1016/j.jobe.2023.107855,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2023.107855,,OCT 2023,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001087052400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, they represent an important source of information for first responders or other stakeholders involved in the post-disaster response process. Several automated methods based on supervised learning have already been demonstrated for damage detection using oblique airborne images. However, they often do not generalize well when data from new unseen sites need to be processed, hampering their practical use. Reasons for this limitation include image and scene characteristics, though the most prominent one relates to the image features being used for training the classifier. Recently features based on deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been shown to be more effective than conventional hand-crafted features, and have become the state-of-the-art in many domains, including remote sensing. Moreover, often oblique images are captured with high block overlap, facilitating the generation of dense 3D point clouds - an ideal source to derive geometric characteristics. We hypothesized that the use of CNN features, either independently or in combination with 3D point cloud features, would yield improved performance in damage detection. To this end we used CNN and 3D features, both independently and in combination, using images from manned and unmanned aerial platforms over several geographic locations that vary significantly in terms of image and scene characteristics. A multiple-kernel-learning framework, an effective way for integrating features from different modalities, was used for combining the two sets of features for classification. The results are encouraging: while CNN features produced an average classification accuracy of about 91%, the integration of 3D point cloud features led to an additional improvement of about 3% (i.e. an average classification accuracy of 94%). The significance of 3D point cloud features becomes more evident in the model transferability scenario (i.e., training and testing samples from different sites that vary slightly in the aforementioned characteristics), where the integration of CNN and 3D point cloud features significantly improved the model transferability accuracy up to a maximum of 7% compared with the accuracy achieved by CNN features alone. Overall, an average accuracy of 85% was achieved for the model transferability scenario across all experiments. Our main conclusion is that such an approach qualifies for practical use.

Current practices remain at a low efficiency to manage the large amount of UAV-collected close-range facade images to support the inspection and documentation of facade anomalies such as cracks and corrosions. This paper proposes a GIS-based two-step procedure to streamline the process of the management of UAV-collected images for supporting building facade inspection. First, a 2D GIS spatial model of building facades is created by net-unfolding facade surfaces around the building footprint in GIS to store the geometric and geographic information of building facades. Then, the UAV-collected images are automatically geo-registered to the 2D GIS spatial model through computer vision techniques applied in GIS. An experimental case study is also presented to demonstrate the process and evaluate the performance of the proposed method. It is demonstrated that the GIS-based spatial model of net-unfolded building facades allows for an efficient and effective registration of UAV-captured close-range facade images without apparent loss of pixel data.

The latter predominates in the design of building footprints and building parts such as facades. Thus the identification and modeling of this valuable information facilitates the reconstruction of these buildings and their parts. This article presents a novel approach for the automatic identification and modelling of symmetries and their hierarchical structures in building footprints, providing an important prior for facade and roof reconstruction. The uncertainty of symmetries is explicitly addressed using supervised machine learning methods, in particular Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Unlike classical statistical methods, for SVMs assumptions on the a priori distribution of the data are not required. Both axial and translational symmetries are detected. The quality of the identified major and minor symmetry axes is assessed by a least squares based adjustment. Context-free formal grammar rules are used to model the hierarchical and repetitive structure of the underlying footprints. We present an algorithm which derives grammar rules based on the previously acquired symmetry information and using lexical analysis describing regular patterns and palindrome-like structures.

Social and economical change is predicted by numerous company leaders, politicians and researchers. Machine and Deep Learning (ML/DL) are sub-types of AI, which are gaining high interest within the community of data scientists and engineers worldwide. Obviously, this global trend does not stop at structural glass engineering, so that, the first part of the present paper is concerned with introducing the basic theoretical frame of AI and its sub-classes of ML and DL while the specific needs and requirements for the application in a structural engineering context are highlighted. Then this paper explores potential applications of AI for different subjects within the design, verification and monitoring of facades and glass structures. Finally, the current status of research as well as successfully conducted industry projects by the authors are presented. The discussion of specific problems ranges from supervised ML in case of the material parameter identification of polymeric interlayers used in laminated glass or the prediction of cut-edge strength based on the process parameters of a glass cutting machine and prediction of fracture patterns of tempered glass to the application of computer vision DL methods to image classification of the Pummel test and the use of semantic segmentation for the detection of cracks at the cut edge of glass. In the summary and conclusion section, the main findings for the applicability and impact of AI for the presented structural glass research and industry problems are compiled. It can be seen that in many cases AI, data, software and computing resources are already available today to successfully implement AI projects in the glass industry, which is demonstrated by the many current examples mentioned. Future research directories however will need to concentrate on how to introduce further glass-specific theoretical and human expert knowledge in the AI training process on the one hand and on the other hand more pronunciation has to be laid on the thorough digitization of workflows associated with the structural glass problem at hand in order to foster the further use of AI within this domain in both research and industry.","[Kraus, M.

However, the images for building segmentation are often in the form of traditional orthophotos, where the relief displacement would cause non-negligible misalignment between the roof outline and the footprint of a building; such misalignment poses considerable challenges for extracting accurate building footprints, especially for high-rise buildings. Aiming at alleviating this problem, a new workflow is proposed for generating rectified building footprints from traditional orthophotos. We first use the facade labels, which are prepared efficiently at low cost, along with the roof labels to train a semantic segmentation network. Then, the well-trained network, which employs the state-of-the-art version of EfficientNet as backbone, extracts the roof segments and the facade segments of buildings from the input image. Finally, after clustering the classified pixels into instance-level building objects and tracing out the roof outlines, an energy function is proposed to drive the roof outline to maximally align with the building footprint; thus, the rectified footprints can be generated. The experiments on the aerial orthophotos covering a high-density residential area in Shanghai demonstrate that the proposed workflow can generate obviously more accurate building footprints than the baseline methods, especially for high-rise buildings.","[Chen, Qi; Zhang, Yuanyi; Li, Xinyuan] China Univ Geosci Wuhan, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Tao, Pengjie] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences; Wuhan University,"Chen, Q (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci Wuhan, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",chenqi@cug.edu.cn; zhangyy@cug.edu.cn; li.xinyuan@cug.edu.cn; pjtao@whu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2022,22,1,,,,,,,207,10.3390/s22010207,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s22010207,,,,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000741383000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

They are particularly detrimental in the case of building envelope materials and systems because these tend to exhibit a large exposed area and relatively narrow thickness. Therefore, tools are needed to model degradation and provide an insight into its occurrence and its relationship with the environmental factors that have the worst effect. In this paper, the degradation of stone wall cladding directly adhered to the substrate is estimated based on the evaluation of the characteristics of 140 wall cladding systems inspected in Lisbon, Portugal. Because it is a complex phenomenon, a probabilistic analysis is developed using multinomial logistic regression. The analysis focuses on the environmental factors that most influence the overall degradation of the facades (condition level). Probabilistic patterns are thus obtained for the evolution over time of each condition level according to their exposure level to outdoor environmental conditions.

Furthermore, climate change affects building retrofit strategies. The current building stock is massive, which means there is a large demand for building retrofitting. Additionally, climatic condi-tions are changing, posing a significant challenge to the current time-consuming and labor-intensive decision-making process. To solve these problems, a dynamic intelligent building decision-making model was established in this study. The static and dynamic features of building retrofit decision-making were identified, four machine learning algorithms were considered, and a case base containing records for 301 retrofitted buildings was established for knowledge mining. The findings demonstrate that the XGBoost algorithm performs well in terms of building retrofit strategy prediction, with 77% accuracy for the pre-diction of building envelope retrofits and 76% accuracy for the prediction of HVAC system retrofits. In addition, the trends of building retrofit strategy decision-making considering dynamic climate conditions were observed. The demand for building envelope retrofitting and heating retrofitting has declined, while the demand for cooling retrofitting has increased. Some buildings are extremely sensitive to climate change, and some redundant retrofitting strategies should be avoided.

I argue that design images - used broadly to refer to all those image-related artifacts that act directly as proxies in the course of devising and adjusting a design: sketches, drawings, plans, diagrams, photorealistic images-make it possible to develop future artifacts and to guarantee the rightness of the emerging design knowledge. Their generative operativity facilitates a media-based reflexivity and in turn makes the images epistemically highly effective. By way of an empirical example, the essay draws on the development of a building facade by architectural firm J. Mayer H. Architects, examining the different image-based techniques used. A brief study of the forms of sketching, rendering, projecting, notating, and scaling reveals a range of image-based epistemic strategies. These strategies enable conclusions to be drawn and insights to be sought in the course of the design process. Analyzing these strategies in greater detail from an image theory perspective offers an important foundation for those sciences in which knowledge has to be generated on the basis of image-based proxies alone.","[Ammon, Sabine] Berlin Univ Technol, Inst Vocat Educ & Work Studies, Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin,"Ammon, S (corresponding author), Berlin Univ Technol, Inst Vocat Educ & Work Studies, Berlin, Germany.",ammon@tu-berlin.de,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,2017,28,,,,,,177,205,,10.1007/978-3-319-56466-1_8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-56466-1_8,10.1007/978-3-319-56466-1,,,Architecture; History & Philosophy Of Science,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000431570400009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Building energy modeling is a reliable technique that provides a pathway to analyze and optimize various energy-efficient building envelope measures. However, conventional optimization analyses are time-consuming and computationally expensive, especially for complex buildings and many optimization parameters. Therefore, this paper proposed a novel optimization algorithm, MEVO (metamodel-based evolutionary optimizer), developed to efficiently identify optimal retrofit solutions for building envelopes while minimizing the need for extensive simulations. The key innovation of MEVO lies in its integration of evolutionary techniques with design-of-computer experiments, machine learning, and metaheuristic optimization. This approach continuously refined a machine learning model through metaheuristic optimization, crossover, and mutation operations. Comparative assessments were conducted against four alternative metaheuristic algorithms and Bayesian optimization, demonstrating MEVO's effectiveness in reliably finding the best solution within a reduced computation time. A hypothesis test revealed that the proposed algorithm is significantly better than Bayesian optimization in finding the best cost values. Regarding computation time, the proposed algorithm is 4-7 times faster than the particle swarm optimization algorithm and has a similar computational speed as Bayesian Optimization.","[Batres, Rafael] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Engn & Sci, Santiago De Queretaro 76140, Queretaro, Mexico; [Dadras, Yasaman; Mostafazadeh, Farzad; Kavgic, Miroslava] Univ Ottawa, Dept Civil Engn, 161 Louis Pasteur Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",Tecnologico de Monterrey; University of Ottawa,"Kavgic, M (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Dept Civil Engn, 161 Louis Pasteur Private, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",rafael.batres@tec.mx; ydadr066@uottawa.ca; farzad.mostafazadeh@uottawa.ca; mkavgic@uottawa.ca,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2023,16,20,,,,,,,7026,10.3390/en16207026,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16207026,,,,Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001093583300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, these methods often rely on prior knowledge. Specifically, they learn the image scene as part of a training dataset. For this reason, when the sampling equipment or scene is changed, monocular visual 3D scene recognition may fail. To cope with this problem, a new method of unsupervised learning for monocular visual 3D scene recognition is here proposed. First, the image is made using superpixel segmentation based on the CIELAB color space values L, a, and b and on the coordinate values x and y of pixels, forming a superpixel image with a specific density. Second, a spectral clustering algorithm based on the superpixels' color characteristics and neighboring relationships was used to reduce the dimensions of the superpixel image. Third, the fuzzy distribution density functions representing sky, ground, and facade are multiplied with the segment pixels, where the expectations of these segments are obtained. A preliminary classification of sky, ground, and facade is generated in this way. Fourth, the most accurate classification images of sky, ground, and facade were extracted through the tier-1 wavelet sampling and Manhattan direction feature. Finally, a depth perception map is generated based on the pinhole imaging model and the linear perspective information of ground surface. Here, 400 images of Make3D Image data from the Cornell University website were used to test the algorithm. The experimental results showed that this unsupervised learning method provides a more effective monocular visual 3D scene recognition model than other methods.","[Zheng Li-ming; Wang Xing-song] Southeast Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China,"Zheng, LM (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2014,9159,,,,,,,,91590N,10.1117/12.2064179,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2064179,,,,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Optics",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000338921100022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Building such tool is challenging as some styles share architectural elements, the bad conservation state of some monuments and the noise included in the image itself. The aim of this paper is to introduce MonuMAI (Monument with Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence) framework. In particular, (i) we designed MonuMAI dataset rich with expert knowledge considering the proposed architectural styles taxonomy and key elements relationship, which allows addressing several tasks, e.g., monument style classification and architectural elements detection, (ii) we developed MonuMAI deep learning pipeline based on lightweight MonuNet architecture for monument style classification and MonuMAI Key Elements Detection (MonuMAI-KED) model, and (iii) we built citizen science based MonuMAI mobile app that uses the proposed MonuMAI deep learning pipeline trained on MonuMAI dataset for performing in real life conditions.

However, building simulation practices to characterize optimized shapes of various geometric design candidates are limited by complex simulation procedures, slow optimization, and lack of site information. This study suggests a practical approach to the design of responsive building facades by integrating on-site sensors, building performance simulation (BPS), machine-learning, and 3D geometry modeling on a unified design interface. To this end, a novel and efficient hybrid optimization algorithm, tabu-based adaptive pattern search simulated annealing (T-APSSA), was developed and integrated with wireless sensor data communication (using nRF24L01 and ESP8266 WiFi modules) on a parametric visual programming language (VPL) interface Rhino Grasshopper (0.9.0076, McNeel, Seattle, USA). The effectiveness of T-APSSA for early-stage BPS and optimal design is compared with other metaheuristic algorithms, and the proposed framework is validated by experimental optimal envelope (window shading) designs for single (daylight) and multiple (daylight and energy) objectives. Test results demonstrate the improved efficiency of T-APSSA in calculations (two to four times faster than other algorithms). This T-APSSA-integrated sensor-enabled design optimization practice supports rapid BPS and digital prototyping of responsive building facade design.","[Yi, Hwang; Kim, Mi-Jin; Kim, Yuri] Ajou Univ, Dept Architecture, Architectural Design & Technol Lab, Suwon 16499, South Korea; [Kim, Sun-Sook; Lee, Kyu-In] Ajou Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Architecture, Suwon 16499, South Korea",Ajou University; Ajou University,"Yi, H (corresponding author), Ajou Univ, Dept Architecture, Architectural Design & Technol Lab, Suwon 16499, South Korea.",hwy@ajou.ac.kr; askhow1999@ajou.ac.kr; archiyuri@nate.com; kss@ajou.ac.kr; kyuinlee@ajou.ac.kr,,,,,,,,13,14,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 1,2019,11,9,,,,,,,2681,10.3390/su11092681,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11092681,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000469518700229,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, nowadays, utilizing fa ade-cleaning robots seems inevitable. However, in case of navigating on cracked glass, these robots may cause hazardous situations. Accordingly, it seems necessary to equip them with crack-detection system to eventually avoid cracked area. In this study, benefitting from convolutional neural networks developed in TensorFlow (TM), a deep-learning-based crack detection approach is introduced for a novel modular facade-cleaning robot. For experimental purposes, the robot is equipped with an on-board camera and the live video is loaded using OpenCV.

Data augmentation techniques and also image pre-processing also apply as a part of process. Simulation and experimental results show that the system can hit the milestone on crack-detection with an accuracy around 90%. This is satisfying enough to replace human-conducted on-site inspections. In addition, a thorough comparison between the performance of optimizers is put forward: Adam optimizer shows higher precision, while Adagrad serves more satisfying recall factor, however, Adam optimizer with the lowest false negative rate and highest accuracy has a better performance.

In this article, we propose a deep learning approach for crack detection on brickwork masonry facades using transfer learning with limited annotated data. Our approach uses a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network model as a feature extractor, which is then optimised specifically for crack detection. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we created and curated a dataset of 700 brickwork masonry facade images, and used 500 images for training, 100 for validation, and the remaining 100 images for testing. Results showed that our approach is very effective in detecting cracks, achieving an accuracy and F1-score of up to 100% when following end-to-end training of the neural network, thus being a promising solution for building inspection and maintenance, particularly in situations where annotated data is limited.

This study developed a coarse-to-fine approach for the extraction of pole-like road objects from MLS data. The major work consists of data preprocessing, coarse-to-fine segmentation, and detection. In data preprocessing, points from different trajectories were reorganized into road parts, and building facades alongside road corridors were removed to reduce their influence. Then, a coarse-to-fine computational framework for the detection of pole-like objects that segments point clouds was proposed. The results show that the pole-like object detection rate for the proposed method was about 90%, and the proposed coarse-to-fine framework was more efficient than the single-scale framework.

We make use of four recent large-scale fires in Sweden to elucidate which factors are important for survival, using multiple logistic regression analysis of data collected at the sites. We obtained data on 187 buildings within the fire perimeters, nearly all with wood paneling and tile- or sheet metal roofing. 35 % of the buildings were lost or badly damaged. Results indicate that most buildings were approached by relatively low-intensity fire and that ignition primarily occurred through direct flame contact. The most important factor for survivability was the presence of a maintained lawn. The second most important was that no flammable material was present close to the building facade. Further, fire intensity often decreased close to buildings due to a larger portion of deciduous trees around gardens than in the surrounding forest. These factors were more important than specific features of the building itself, reflecting that the majority of buildings have combustible wooden facades. Our results suggest that the greatest potential for increasing building safety in the Swedish WUI is to keep the area immediately surrounding the building (similar to 5 m) free from tree litter and other flammable material. Also, since fire intensities are generally low, buildings can in most cases be defended with simple tools without compromising personal safety.","[Plathner, Frida Vermina; Sjostrom, Johan] RISE Res Inst Sweden, Dept Fire Technol, Box 857, S-50115 Boras, Sweden; [Granstrom, Anders] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, S-90183 Umea, Sweden",RISE Research Institutes of Sweden; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Plathner, FV (corresponding author), RISE Res Inst Sweden, Dept Fire Technol, Box 857, S-50115 Boras, Sweden.",frida.vermina.plathner@ri.se,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2023,157,,,,,,,,105928,10.1016/j.ssci.2022.105928,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2022.105928,,SEP 2022,,"Engineering, Industrial; Operations Research & Management Science",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000860978200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results show that for root and facades semantic classes respectively, recall is 84% and 76% and precision is 72% and 63%. The number and distribution of correct points well represent the geometry, thus allowing to use them as support for CityGML and BIM modelling.

Two artificial intelligence models, such as multiple linear regression and artificial neural networks, have been used to predict. The wall temperature has been predicted mainly based on the parameters like ambient temperature, wind speed and relative humidity in all four directions of the buildings. Three statistical analyses were used to validate the model's outcome: R-Squared, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). In terms of train and control data, the two models yield comparable findings. The artificial neural network model has more adaptability since it was able to adjust to unexpected changes in the input data, according to a comparison of the applied mathematics of each model. The regression model was used for this investigation because it gives constant estimate values for the factors, though the neural model isn't numerically characterized. The review infers that the neural model must be utilized as an additional way to predict the wall temperature. This study can plan and adapt buildings for future work, considering the most critical climatic conditions. It also assists architects and engineers in determining the appropriate insulation for the building envelope, which improves its thermal performance.","[Aishwarya, S.; Balasubramanian, M.] SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",SRM Institute of Science & Technology Chennai,"Balasubramanian, M (corresponding author), SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.",balamv86@gmail.com,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2022,10,,,,SI,,,,,10.36909/jer.ACMM.16317,http://dx.doi.org/10.36909/jer.ACMM.16317,,,,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000752608200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

One area ideally suited to exploit this powerful new technology is building performance simulation. Physics-based models have traditionally been used to estimate the energy flow, air movement, and heat balance of buildings. However, physics-based models require many assumptions, significant computational power, and a considerable amount of time to output predictions. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) with prefabricated or simulated data are likely to be a more feasible option for environmental analysis conducted by designers during the early design phase. Because ANNs require fewer inputs and shorter computation times and offer superior performance and potential for data augmentation, they have received increased attention for predicting the surface solar radiation on buildings. Furthermore, ANNs can provide innovative and quick design solutions, enabling designers to receive instantaneous feedback on the effects of a proposed change to a building's design. This research introduces deep learning methods as a means of simulating the annual radiation intensities and exposure level of buildings without the need for physics-based engines. We propose the CoolVox model to demonstrate the feasibility of using 3D convolutional neural networks to predict the surface radiation on building facades. The CoolVox model accurately predicted the radiation intensities of building facades under different boundary conditions and performed better than ARINet (with average mean square errors of 0.01 and 0.036, respectively) in predicting the radiation intensity both with (validation error = 0.0165) and without (validation error = 0.0066) the presence of boundary buildings.","[Han, Jung Min; Malkawi, Ali] Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Design, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Han, Jung Min; Malkawi, Ali] Harvard Ctr Green Bldg & Cities, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Choi, Eun Seuk] Harvard John A Paulson Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA USA",Harvard University,"Han, JM (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Design, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Han, JM (corresponding author), Harvard Ctr Green Bldg & Cities, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jhan2harvard@gmail.com,,,,,,,,7,9,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2022,15,5,,,,,755,768,,10.1007/s12273-021-0837-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12273-021-0837-0,,SEP 2021,,Thermodynamics; Construction & Building Technology,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000697093000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A rephotographed image is the best presentation to visualize and study the social changes of a location over time. Traditionally, only expert artists and photographers are capable of generating the rephotograph of any specific location. Manual editing or human eye judgment that is considered for generating rephotographs normally requires a lot of precision, effort and is not always accurate. In the era of computer science and deep learning, computer vision techniques make it easier and faster to perform precise operations to an image. Until now many research methodologies have been proposed for rephotography but none of them is fully automatic. Some of these techniques require manual input by the user or need multiple images of the same location with 3D point cloud data while others are only suggestions to the user to perform rephotography. In historical records/archives most of the time we can find only one 2D image of a certain location. Computational rephotography is a challenge in the case of using only one image of a location captured at different timestamps because it is difficult to find the accurate perspective of a single 2D historical image. Moreover, in the case of building rephotography, it is required to maintain the alignments and regular shape. The features of a building may change over time and in most of the cases, it is not possible to use a features detection algorithm to detect the key features. In this research paper, we propose a methodology to rephotograph house images by combining deep learning and traditional computer vision techniques. The purpose of this research is to rephotograph an image of the past based on a single image. This research will be helpful not only for computer scientists but also for history and cultural heritage research scholars to study the social changes of a location during a specific time period, and it will allow users to go back in time to see how a specific place looked in the past.

Their reconstruction and representation as three-dimensional city models have attracted the attention of many researchers and industry specialists, as they increasingly recognise the potential for new applications requiring detailed building models. Nevertheless, despite being investigated for a few decades, the comprehensive reconstruction of buildings remains a challenging task. While there is a considerable body of literature on this topic, including several systematic reviews summarising ways of acquiring and reconstructing coarse building structures, there is a paucity of in-depth research on the detection and reconstruction of facade openings (i.e., windows and doors). In this review, we provide an overview of emerging applications, data acquisition and processing techniques for building facade reconstruction, emphasising building opening detection. The use of traditional technologies from terrestrial and aerial platforms, along with emerging approaches, such as mobile phones and volunteered geography information, is discussed. The current status of approaches for opening detection is then examined in detail, separated into methods for three-dimensional and two-dimensional data. Based on the review, it is clear that a key limitation associated with facade reconstruction is process automation and the need for user intervention. Another limitation is the incompleteness of the data due to occlusion, which can be reduced by data fusion. In addition, the lack of available diverse benchmark datasets and further investigation into deep-learning methods for facade openings extraction present crucial opportunities for future research.","[Klimkowska, Anna; Grebby, Stephen] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Geospatial Inst, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham NG7 2TU, England; [Cavazzi, Stefano] Ordnance Survey, Adanac Dr, Southampton SO16 0AS, Hants, England; [Leach, Richard] Univ Nottingham, Dept Mech Mat & Mfg Engn, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Klimkowska, A (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Geospatial Inst, Jubilee Campus, Nottingham NG7 2TU, England.",anna.klimkowska@nottingham.ac.uk; stefano.cavazzi@os.uk; richard.leach@nottingham.ac.uk; stephen.grebby@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2022,14,11,,,,,,,2579,10.3390/rs14112579,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14112579,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000809060900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Related studies, e.g. vehicle detection and classification, mostly focus on static images or video. Whereas mobile laser scanning (MLS) systems are increasingly utilized for urban street environment perception due to their direct 3D information acquisition, high accuracy and movability. In this paper, we design a complete system for car park monitoring, including vehicle recognition, localization, classification and change detection, from laser scanning point clouds. The experimental data are acquired by an MLS system using high frequency laser scanner which scans the streets vertically along the system's moving trajectory. The point clouds are firstly classified as ground, building facade, and street objects which are then segmented using state-of-the-art methods. Each segment is treated as an object hypothesis, and its geometric features are extracted. Moreover, a deformable vehicle model is fitted to each object. By fitting an explicit model to the vehicle points, detailed information, such as precise position and orientation, can be obtained. The model parameters are also treated as vehicle features. Together with the geometric features, they are applied to a supervised learning procedure for vehicle or non-vehicle recognition. The classes of detected vehicles are also investigated. Whether vehicles have changed across two datasets acquired at different times is detected to estimate the durations. Here, vehicles are trained pair-wisely. Two same or different vehicles are paired up as training samples. As a result, the vehicle recognition, classification and change detection accuracies are 95.9%, 86.0% and 98.7%, respectively. Vehicle modelling improves not only the recognition rate, but also the localization precision compared to bounding boxes. (C) 2016 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

However, most existing methods can produce plausible results, but fail to generate finer textures and structures. This is mainly due to the fact that (1) the generation of finer content in the masked region of an image is not constrained enough during network training, and (2) many different alternative pixels are exist to fill in the masked regions, making it very difficult for the inpainting network to generate reasonable sharp edges. To address these issues, we propose a Scale Enhanced GAN (SE-GAN) model which combines the constraints of large- and small-scale receptive fields of our tailor-made discriminators to achieve fine-grained constraint on image details, a novel edge loss to further ensure the sharpness of the generated image.

Inspection practitioners have to manually examine the large amounts of high-resolution images collected by UAVs to identify anomalies or damages on building facades for reporting and repairs. The computer vision and deep learning technologies have emerged as promising solutions to automate the image-based inspection process. However, for the detection of facade cracks from UAV-captured images, existing deep learning solutions may not perform well due to the complicated background noises caused by different facade components and materials. Towards that end, this paper proposed a two-step deep learning method for the automated detection of facade cracks from UAV-captured images. In the first step, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model was designed and trained on 26,177 images to classify images in a patch-level size of 128 x 128 pixels into crack or non-crack. In the second step, a U-Net neural network model was trained on 2870 image sets to segment crack pixels within those patches classified as cracks. Experimental results show a high performance of 94% and 96% precision, 94% and 95% recall, and 94% and 96% F1-scores was achieved by the CNN model and the U-Net model respectively. The experimental results proved that the twostep method can improve the reliability and efficiency of detecting and differentiating facade cracks from complicated facade noises. The proposed method can also be extended to detect other types of facade anomalies (e.g., corrosion and joint failures), thus facilitating a comprehensive assessment of facade conditions for better decision-making for the maintenance of building facades during its service life.","[Chen, Kaiwen] Univ Alabama, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 401 7th Ave, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Reichard, Georg; Akanmu, Abiola] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Bldg Construct, 1365 Perry St, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Xu, Xin] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Chen, KW (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 401 7th Ave, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",kaiwen.chen@ua.edu; reichard@vt.edu; xu942@purdue.edu; abiola@vt.edu,,,,,,,,37,37,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021,43,,,,,,,,102913,10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102913,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102913,,JUL 2021,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000701626700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

To automatically achieve visual evaluation of facade condition with high accuracy, current studies have applied various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to classify, localize, and segment the defects. However, the methods in previous research mainly focused on accuracy improvement rather than providing effective evaluations of defects according to the requirement of industry standards. Therefore, this study proposes a rule-based deep learning method to achieve evaluation-oriented facade defects detection, which can be used to provide effective evaluation areas containing the necessary information (e.g., type, location, quantity, and size of facade defects) for condition evaluation. First, annotation rules for classification, segmentation, and localization are designed to instruct the manual annotation work and automatically adjust the bounding boxes into effective evaluation areas. Then, a proposal weighting rule is developed to be combined with the deep learning model during the model training process to improve the accuracy and stability of the predictions. A rectification rule is further used to adjust the raw predictions into predictions with effective evaluation areas for facade defects. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrated that using the proposed method can successfully improve the performance of facade defects detection to meet the requirement of condition evaluation. Besides, this method is tested to be adaptable to various distance settings in the requirement.","[Guo, Jingjing; Wang, Qian] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Built Environm, Singapore 117566, Singapore; [Li, Yiting] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Fac Engn, Singapore 117583, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Wang, Q (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Built Environm, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",bdgwang@nus.edu.sg,,,,,,,,12,12,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021,131,,,,,,,,103910,10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103910,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2021.103910,,AUG 2021,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000696957700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The performance of such prediction-based control techniques relies heavily on models of a building's thermal dynamics. However, the development of high-fidelity building thermal dynamic models is challenging, given the presence of large uncertainties that affect thermal loads in buildings, such as building envelope performance, thermal mass, internal heat gains, and occupant behavior. In this paper, we propose a method to identify both a resistive-capacitive parametric model and nonparametric load uncertainties using measured input-output data. The parametric model is obtained using semi-parametric regression, whereas the nonparametric terms are based on the Random Forest algorithm in which regression trees are used to derive the dependency of nonparametric terms on both building operation parameters and ambient temperature. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated using experimental data collected from an office building at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) campus.

Zoom lens camera systems have therefore been extensively adopted in computer vision where precise measurement is not the primary objective. However, the variation of intrinsic camera parameters with respect to zoom lens settings poses a series of calibration challenges that have inhibited widespread use in close-range photogrammetry. A flexible zoom lens calibration methodology is therefore proposed in this study, developed with the aim of simplifying the calibration process and promoting practical photogrammetric application. A zoom-dependent camera model that incorporates empirical zoom-related intrinsic parameters into the collinearity condition equations is developed. Coefficients of intrinsic parameters are solved in a single adjustment based on this zoom lens camera model. To validate the approach, experiments on both optical- and digital-zoom lens cameras were conducted using a planar board with evenly distributed circular targets. Zoom lens calibration was performed with images taken at four different zoom settings spread throughout the zoom range of a lens. Photogrammetric accuracies achieved through both mono-focal and multi-focal triangulations were evaluated after calibration. The relative accuracies for mono-focal triangulations ranged from 1: 6300 to 1: 18,400 for the two cameras studied, whereas the multi-focal triangulation accuracies ranged from 1: 11,300 to 1: 16,200. In order to demonstrate the applicability of the approach, calibrated zoom lens imagery was used to render a laser-scanned point cloud of a building facade. Considered alongside experimental results, the successful application demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed calibration method, thereby facilitating the adoption of zoom lens cameras in close range photogrammetry for a wide range of scientific and practical applications.","[Wang, Zheng; Mills, Jon; Xiao, Wen; Li, Zhenhong] Newcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Huang, Rongyong] Guangxi Univ, Sch Marine Sci, 100 Daxue East Rd, Nanning 530004, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Shunyi] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China",Newcastle University - UK; Guangxi University; Wuhan University,"Wang, Z (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geosci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",z.wang66@newcastle.ac.uk; jon.mills@newcastle.ac.uk; Wen.Xiao@newcastle.ac.uk; rongyonghuang@163.com; syzheng@whu.edu.cn; Zhenhong.Li@newcastle.ac.uk,,,,,,,,7,10,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2017,9,3,,,,,,,244,10.3390/rs9030244,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs9030244,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000398720100058,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is the recent trend for image-to-image transformation. The existing GAN models suffer due to the lack of utilization of proper synthesization objectives. In this paper, we propose a new Cyclic-Synthesized Generative Adversarial Networks (CSGAN) for the development of expert and intelligent systems for image-to-image transformation. The proposed CSGAN uses a new objective function based on the proposed cyclic-synthesized loss between the synthesized image of one domain and cycled image of another domain. The proposed CSGAN enforces the mapping from one domain to another domain more accurately by limiting the scope of redundant transformation with the help of the cyclic-synthesized loss. The performance of the proposed CSGAN is evaluated on four benchmark image-to-image transformation datasets, including CUHK Face dataset, WHU-IIP Thermal-Visible Face Dataset, CMP Facades dataset, and NYU-Depth Dataset. The results are computed using the widely used evaluation metrics such as MSE, SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS. The experimental results of the proposed CSGAN approach are compared with the latest state-of-the-art approaches, such as GAN, Pix2Pix, DualGAN, CycleGAN, and PS2GAN. The proposed CSGAN technique outperforms all the methods over CUHK dataset, WHU-IIP dataset, NYU-Depth dataset, and exhibits promising and comparable performance over Facades dataset in terms of both qualitative and quantitative measures.

Although it is 'performance-based', the final selection of a real design project still needs to consider the aesthetics of design choices. However, due to the overwhelming number of design choices generated by PGAD, it is difficult for designers to choose the most favourable one from them. Therefore, the current study tries to integrate the technology of sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) into the selecting stage of PGAD. Rather than navigating alternatives one from another and getting lost, designers can directly find the most aesthetically preferred one by inputting his/her hand-drawn design. A design project of fenestrating a multiple-floor office building is used to demonstrate this method and test three SBIR algorithms: Angular radial partitioning (ARP), Angular radial orientation partitioning (AROP), and Sketch-A-Net model (SAN). Test results show that AROP performs the best among these three algorithms. Its retrievals are most similar to inquiry images drawn by architects. Meanwhile, performances of AROP with different template combinations are also rated. After that, AROP with the best template is also tested with incompletely drawn inquiry images. In the end, investigation results are validated by another building facade design case. The current study automates the PGAD process stepwise, making it more applicable to real design projects.","[Zhao, Shenghuan; Chen, Jianping] Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Shenghuan; Chen, Jianping] Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Jiangsu Key Lab Intelligent Bldg Energy Efficienc, Suzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Luo; Qian, Xueming] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Xian, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jianping] Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Suzhou, Peoples R China",Suzhou University of Science & Technology; Suzhou University of Science & Technology; Xi'an Jiaotong University; Suzhou University of Science & Technology,"Chen, JP (corresponding author), Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Suzhou, Peoples R China.;Chen, JP (corresponding author), Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Jiangsu Key Lab Intelligent Bldg Energy Efficienc, Suzhou, Peoples R China.;Chen, JP (corresponding author), Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Suzhou, Peoples R China.",alanjpchen@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2022,38,8,,,,,2981,2997,,10.1007/s00371-021-02170-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00371-021-02170-x,,JUN 2021,,"Computer Science, Software Engineering",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000660360700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objective functions to be minimised were thermal discomfort hours (TDH), daylight unsatisfied hours (DUH) and life cycle costs (LCC) while maintaining acceptable sound transmission levels and indoor air quality. The decision variables were envelope components of a prefabricated house. Applications for six different climate zones corresponding to eight locations in Australia were investigated. The optimal solution sets were unique for each climate zone. The optimal solutions achieved 27-31% savings in LCC compared to the baseline. The reductions for TDH varied from 6% to 55% among the locations.

One of the largest causes for this type of energy consumption is heat loss. Energy loss can be attributed to inefficiency and sub-surface defects in the structure that reduce the thermal resistance and facilitate unwanted heat transmission within the environment. In recent years, infrared (IR) thermography has proven to be an excellent tool for detecting heat loss from a building envelope. At the same time, advancements in computer vision systems have enabled the use of Structure from Motion (SfM) as a photogrammetry technique. SfM is used for the generation of three-dimensional (3D) building information modeling (BIM). It has the potential to facilitate remote visual inspection of large-scale structures and infrastructure systems by creating virtual renderings. The results of an experiment performed on a lab-scale building using both IR and SfM techniques is analyzed. In particular, the accuracy of SfM in generating a 3D virtual rendering of a target object by using images acquired from a low-cost IR camera is discussed. IR images of a building are recorded and are used for reconstructing a digital model of the structure. The goal is to characterize the viability of SfM in detecting sub-surface defects that can yield to significant heat loss and reduce thermal efficiency in the facade of the building.","[Sabato, Alessandro; Niezrecki, Christopher] Univ Massachusetts Lowell, Dept Mech Engn, 1 Univ Ave, Lowell, MA 01854 USA; [Puliti, Marco] Politecn Torino, Dept Automat & Comp Sci, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10121 Turin, TO, Italy",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Lowell; Polytechnic University of Turin,"Sabato, A (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts Lowell, Dept Mech Engn, 1 Univ Ave, Lowell, MA 01854 USA.",Alessandro_Sabato@uml.edu,,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,11381,,,,,,,,1138125,10.1117/12.2558796,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2558796,,,,"Mechanics; Materials Science, Characterization & Testing; Optics",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000624394000028,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the scalability and implementation of DRL controllers are still limited since they require a considerable amount of time before converging to a near-optimal solution. This issue is currently addressed in literature through the offline pre -training of the DRL agent. However this solution results in two main critical issues: (1) the need to develop a building surrogate model to perform the training task, and (2) the need to perform a fine-tuning process over several training episodes to obtain a near-optimal control policy.In this context, this paper introduces an Online Transfer Learning (OTL) strategy that exploits two knowledge-sharing techniques, weight-initialization and imitation learning, to transfer a DRL control policy from a source office building to various target buildings in a simulation environment coupling EnergyPlus and Python.A DRL controller based on discrete Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) is trained on the source building to manage the operation of a cooling system consisting of a chiller and a thermal storage. Several target buildings are defined to benchmark the performance of the OTL strategy with that of a Rule-Based Controller (RBC) and two DRL-based control strategies, deployed in offline and online fashion. The strategy adopted for OTL emulates the real world implementation with a simulation process by implementing the transferred DRL agent for a single episode in the target buildings. Target buildings have the same geometrical features and are served by the same energy system as the source building, but differ in terms of weather conditions, electricity price schedules, occupancy patterns, and building envelope efficiency levels. The results show that the OTL strategy can reduce the cumulated sum of temperature violations on average by 50% and 80% respectively when compared to RBC and online DRL while enhancing the energy system operation with electricity cost savings ranging between 20% and 40%. The OTL agent performs slightly worse than the offline DRL controller but it does not require any modeling effort and can be implemented directly on target buildings emulating a real-world implementation.","[Coraci, Davide; Brandi, Silvio; Capozzoli, Alfonso] Politecn Torino, Dept Energy, BAEDA Lab, TEBE Res Grp, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Hong, Tianzhen] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Bldg Technol & Urban Syst Div, One Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Polytechnic University of Turin; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,"Capozzoli, A (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Dept Energy, BAEDA Lab, TEBE Res Grp, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",alfonso.capozzoli@polito.it,,,,,,,,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 1,2023,333,,,,,,,,120598,10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.120598,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.120598,,JAN 2023,,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000925256500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is mainly due to the complex and dynamic overshadowing effects created on the building envelope. Accurately quantifying these effects could be the key to predicting reductions in solar availability which, in turn, can significantly affect daylight and the thermal performance of buildings, as well as the potential for PVs and other renewables sources. It is therefore necessary to use simulation tools in order to predict the mutual complex effects.

Through the application of Artificial Intelligence many design decisions can be made automatically. Since most design tasks are ultimately unique and therefore not operational, fully automatic facade design will not always lead to a satisfactory result. For these reasons, the authors propose a targeted combination of rational (rule-based) and intuitive (poetic) design strategies. The design task is divided into operational subtasks that are processed automatically on the computer and non-operational subtasks that are solved by computers and humans together. A creative and agile design team evaluates different variants proposed by the computer. Promising developments will be pursued and further developed. Then the generative mechanism is adapted and the design is optimized. The concept is refined until a sustainable, user-oriented design is available. However, for the foreseeable future, the solution of non-operational problems will only be possible through human intelligence. The fear that good architecture can be generated at the push of a button and that computers will replace architects and engineers is therefore unfounded.","[Heusler, Winfried; Kadija, Ksenija] Schuco Int KG, Global Bldg Excellence, Karolinenstr 1-15, D-33609 Bielefeld, Germany; [Heusler, Winfried] Univ Appl Sci, Detmold Sch Architecture & Interior Architecture, Detmold, Germany",,"Heusler, W (corresponding author), Schuco Int KG, Global Bldg Excellence, Karolinenstr 1-15, D-33609 Bielefeld, Germany.",WHeusler@schueco.com,,,,,,,,1,2,,,,,,,,,,,,2018,10,4,,,,,220,233,,10.1080/17508975.2018.1493979,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17508975.2018.1493979,,,,Construction & Building Technology,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000445817800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The machine vision challenge is to generate accurate urban maps from existing data with minimal manual annotation. In this work, we propose a novel methodology that takes GPS registered LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) point clouds and street view images as inputs and creates semantic labels for the 3D points clouds using a hybrid of rule-based parsing and learning-based labelling that combine point cloud and photometric features. The rule-based parsing boosts segmentation of simple and large structures such as street surfaces and building facades that span almost 75% of the point cloud data. For more complex structures, such as cars, trees and pedestrians, we adopt boosted decision trees that exploit both structure (LiDAR) and photometric (street view) features. We provide qualitative examples of our methodology in 3D visualization where we construct parametric graphical models from labelled data and in 2D image segmentation where 3D labels are back projected to the street view images.

Existing methods lack efficiency, robustness, and accuracy, and depend on many additional features such as point cloud reflectivity and color. This paper proposes a robust and automatic method to extract building facade maps. First, an improved 3D Hough transform is proposed by adding shift vote and 3D convolution of the accumulator to improve computational efficiency and reduce peak fuzziness and dependence on the step selection. These modifications make the extraction of potential planes fast and accurate. Second, the coplane and vertical plane constraints are introduced to eliminate pseudoplanes and nonbuilding facades. Then, we propose a strategy to refine the potential facade and to achieve the accurate calibration and division of the adjacent facade boundaries by clustering the refined point clouds of the facade. This process solves the problem where adjoining surfaces are merged into the same surface in the traditional method. Finally, the extracted facade point clouds are converted into feature images. Doors, windows, and building edges are accurately extracted via deep learning and digital image processing techniques, which combine to achieve accurate extraction of building facades. The proposed method was tested on the MLS and TLS point cloud datasets, which were collected from different cities with different building styles. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method decreases computational burden, improves efficiency, and achieves the accurate differentiation of adjacent facade boundaries with higher accuracy compared with the traditional method, verifying the robustness of the method. Additionally, the proposed method uses only point cloud geometry information, effectively reducing data requirements and acquisition costs.","[Yu, Bing; Hu, Jinlong; Dong, Xiujun; Xiao, Dongsheng; Wu, Tao; Hu, Yunliang; Wang, Bing] Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geomat, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China; [Dong, Xiujun; Dai, Keren] Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Geohazard Prevent & Geoenvironm Pro, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Dai, Keren] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Earth Sci, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bo] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Fac Geosci & Environm Engn, Chengdu 611756, Peoples R China",Southwest Petroleum University; Chengdu University of Technology; Chengdu University of Technology; Southwest Jiaotong University,"Dong, XJ (corresponding author), Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Geomat, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R China.;Dong, XJ (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Geohazard Prevent & Geoenvironm Pro, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China.",dongxiujun@cdut.cn,,,,,,,,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2022,14,16,,,,,,,3848,10.3390/rs14163848,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14163848,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000845285400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, in the hot-humid tropical environment of Nigeria, much is not known about how buildings with different types of facade finishes or claddings are liable to microbial decay. The purpose of this research is to investigate the susceptibility of buildings with different types of facade finishes to microbial decay in Enugu metropolis, southeast Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach A survey involving physical observation of purposively selected 383 buildings and questionnaire administration to their owners was carried out in the study area. The data were subjected to descriptive and logistic regression analyses. Findings Most of the 383 buildings sampled were less than 41 year and 47% of them had painted facade finishes followed by 25.1% with cementitious finishes. Around 63.4% of the buildings had their facade finishes or claddings colonised by microbes. Older buildings of 15 years and above and those with cementitious materials and paints as their predominant facade finishes were more likely to experience microbial decay than newer ones and those having refractory bricks, ceramic tiles, aluminium composite materials and plastics/polymers as their predominant facade finishes or claddings. Practical implications The study identifies the categories of buildings that are likely to be more susceptible to microbial decay; and thus contributes to research on how to slow down the rate of biodeterioration of building facade finishes or claddings in the hot-humid tropical environments. Originality/value This is the first study on the susceptibility of buildings with different types of facade finishes or claddings to microbial decay in the hot-humid tropical environment of Enugu metropolis, southeast Nigeria. It also provides a clue on the age at which buildings become more vulnerable to microbial decay in the study area.","[Uzuegbunam, Francis O.; Ibem, Eziyi O.] Univ Nigeria, Fac Environm Studies, Dept Architecture, Enugu, Nigeria; [Isiofia, Lawrence A.] Enugu State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Architecture, Enugu, Nigeria",University of Nigeria,"Uzuegbunam, FO (corresponding author), Univ Nigeria, Fac Environm Studies, Dept Architecture, Enugu, Nigeria.",francis.uzuegbunam@unn.edu.ng,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,2022 AUG 11,2022,,,,,,,,,,10.1108/IJBPA-02-2022-0028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IJBPA-02-2022-0028,,AUG 2022,,Construction & Building Technology,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000838103100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, these new design methods pose a question regarding the reasoning behind them, and sometimes the aesthetic interest dominates the true function of the envelope system and contrasts it. In opposite, too much engineering in the envelope system creates a problem with the identity of the facade. The purpose of this paper is to propose a method to integrate two different performances, quality and quantity, into one measurable goal. Using an existing building's facade as a case study, the building's facade was analyzed to understand the architect's logic behind its design. Then the found logic was programmed into the tool that allowed for the morphing of the facade into a different configuration, which can be evaluated by both quality and quantity performance to find the better solution to satisfy both goals. For the purpose of this paper, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms were considered to find solutions. For a quantitative objective, the indoor daylight availability was used as a measurement to allow for the best daylighting performance envelope system. For a qualitative objective, a matrix was developed to find the user's design preference and used it to evaluate and find a quantitative performance goal. The proposed method provides building facades that satisfy daylighting performance, and most importantly, it allows users to match their aesthetic sensibilities with the design preference.","[Yi, Yun Kyu] Univ Illinois, Sch Architecture, 117 Temple Hoyne Buell Hall,608 Lorado Taft Dr, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Yi, YK (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Sch Architecture, 117 Temple Hoyne Buell Hall,608 Lorado Taft Dr, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.",ykyi@illinois.edu,,,,,,,,42,44,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2019,156,,,,,,178,190,,10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.04.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.04.002,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000466776900017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Within the context of 3D recording technology it has also seen application in several areas, most notably in creating semantically rich point clouds which is usually performed manually. In this paper, we propose the introduction of deep learning-based semantic image segmentation into the photogrammetric 3D reconstruction and classification workflow. The main objective is to be able to introduce semantic classification at the beginning of the classical photogrammetric workflow in order to automatically create classified dense point clouds by the end of the said workflow. In this regard, automatic image masking depending on pre-determined classes were performed using a previously trained neural network. The image masks were then employed during dense image matching in order to constraint the process into the respective classes, thus automatically creating semantically classified point clouds as the final output. Results show that the developed method is promising, with automation of the whole process feasible from input (images) to output (labelled point clouds).

In particular, individual-level AH detection provides essential information for fine-resolution urban studies, government decision-makers, and private sector practitioners. However, three primary conventional data sources (field data, utility data, and remote sensing data) cannot suffice to collect such fine-resolution data in the large spatial area via a cost-effective approach. To this end, Google Street View (GSV) imagery, which emerges as the mainstream open-access data source with global coverage, provides an opportunity to address this issue. Subsequently, a follow-up challenge confronting the detection of AH arises from the fact that it lacks an effective method that can discern authentic visual features from the redundant noise in GSV images. In this study, we aim to develop an effective method to detect individual-level AH from GSV imagery. Specifically, we developed a new hierarchical deep learning method to leverage both global and local visual features of AH in the detection. The method can be further divided into three steps: (1) Scene-based classification that can extract global visual features of AH was implemented through fine-tuning a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model. (2) We developed a patch-based classification method that can extract specific local features of AH. In this method, patches were generated from GSV images based on auto-detected local features, followed by being labeled as three categories: building patches, vegetation patches, and others. Two deep CNN models were employed to identify deteriorated building facade patches and overgrown vegetation patches, respectively. (3) Individual-level AH were detected by integrating scene classification results and patch classification results in a decision-tree model. Experimental results showed that the F-score of AH was 0.84 in a well-prepared dataset collected from five different Rust Belt cities. The proposed hierarchical deep learning approach effectively improved the accuracy comparing with the traditional scene-based method. In addition, the proposed method was applied to generate an AH map in a new site in Detroit, MI. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of GSV imagery in AH detection and showed great potential to detect AH in a large spatial extent.","[Zou, Shengyuan; Wang, Le] Univ Buffalo State Univ New York, Dept Geog, Amherst, NY 14261 USA",,"Wang, L (corresponding author), Univ Buffalo State Univ New York, Dept Geog, Amherst, NY 14261 USA.",szou2@buffalo.edu; lewang@buffalo.edu,,,,,,,,13,15,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2021,175,,,,,,298,310,,10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2021.03.020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2021.03.020,,APR 2021,,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000644695700021,View Full Record in Web of Science

The most significant characteristic of the method is that it augments objects in images, rather than augmenting images, to solve the data imbalance problem. Moreover, it employs the bounding-box form for object detection, instead of the segmentation mask form. To evaluate the method, 7635 images obtained using unmanned aerial vehicles were utilized as the original training dataset. The faster region-based convolutional neural network model trained with the augmented training dataset using the method exhibited better performance than the model trained with the original dataset. Particularly, the class with the least objects in the original dataset displayed a markedly improved performance.

However, complying with these policies is expensive and time-consuming for government agencies and building owners, especially for old buildings where detailed building information is not readily available. In this work, we propose an automatic, non-intrusive, and scalable framework to capture energy-essential building variables through reasoning building facade images -FacadeReasoner. Specifically, we first build a comprehensive building information dataset and identify the most impactful (i.e., principal) variables in relation to building energy performance and GHG emissions using the state-of-the-art feature attribution model. Next, we propose a method to automatically collect an urban scale building image dataset with more than 10,000 facade images and extract principal-building-variables from these images using deep transfer learning. Results show that FacadeReasoner has the capability to predict principal building variables, namely building type (accuracy 0.77), year built (accuracy 0.62), building height (R2 0.80), and rough estimates of building area (R2 0.46) from facade images. This study is unique as it marks the first attempt to enable an automated end-to-end framework for urban scale principal-building-variables extraction, providing an efficient and economical alternative for large building portfolio owners and managers (e.g., municipalities) to comprehend urban scale energy-related building information for informed decision-making, directly contributing to Net-Zero 2050.","[Yu, Xinran; Ergan, Semiha] NYU, Dept Civil & Urban Engn, 6 Metrotech Ctr, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [Zou, Zhengbo] Univ British Columbia, Fac Appl Sci, Dept Civil Engn, 6250 Appl Sci Ln, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering; University of British Columbia,"Yu, XR (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Civil & Urban Engn, 6 Metrotech Ctr, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.",celiayu@nyu.edu; zhengbo@civil.ubc.ca; semiha@nyu.edu,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 15,2023,344,,,,,,,,121228,10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121228,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121228,,MAY 2023,,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001001414700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/Methodology/Approach The methodology is construed over four successive phases, namely: the built environment modeling, analyses for a solid understanding of the study area, determination of the generative design criteria, and finally design solutions. In the initial phase, the case-study building in Basmane with the surrounding environment was digitally modeled for the following analyses. Several programs apart from BIM have been utilized for the daylight zones and wind simulations. The daylight areas affecting the surface of the studied building were marked schematically per the simulation data. Subsequently, the area of the curtain wall, material type, preliminary building unit cost (assembly/labor and material cost), the height of storey, the density of elements, and fixed shading devices parameters were tested via optimization thru generative design methodology and provide potential design solutions by utilization of BIM tools. Findings The findings of this study could be boiled down to a single comprehensive objective of generating outputs of assorted design solutions thru a generative design approach. When the output data set is visualized via parallel coordinate graphs, it could be well articulated that the classification of rule-based relationships and the criteria interrelations were based on the designer's decisions. Research Limitations/Implications This study was examined on a case basis by an experimental approach. It shall be considered that the curtain wall construction encompasses diverse materials, connection details, and construction techniques that affect the final cost thus this research was conducted at the preliminary design stage and might not reflect actual costs. Social/Practical Implications Albeit the technical aspect of the curtain walls is not included in this case study, it helps generative design culture by demonstrating the extent of the opportunities it offers to designers in the preliminary design stage. Originality/Value This study is a show-case of a preliminary design for an actual building stock in the vicinity of Basmane focusing on the building envelope design process with multiple parameters and should be regarded as an opportunity to understand how innovative solutions alike are put forward for the use of designers.","[Yonder, Veli Mustafa] Izmir Inst Technol, Fac Architecture, Izmir, Turkey",Izmir Institute of Technology,"Yönder, VM (corresponding author), Izmir Inst Technol, Fac Architecture, Izmir, Turkey.",velimustafayonder@gmail.com,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2020,8,,,,SI,,1,17,,10.15320/ICONARP.2020.140,http://dx.doi.org/10.15320/ICONARP.2020.140,,,,Architecture,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000604347700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The recent emergence of the potentiality of deep learning and computer vision has provided an alternative to traditional empirical-based judgment, which is limited by its subjective bias and high traversal costs. To address these challenges, this study aims to build a workflow for a visual analysis of function and facade to extract the different contributions that facade elements provide to functional expression. The approach is demonstrated with an experiment on a section of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) where large-scale historical buildings images were categorized to identify functions using deep learning, together with activation and substance for visual calculations. First, the dataset aggregated with images of historic buildings along the CER was used to identify functional categories using SE-DenseNet merging channel attention. The results of the model visualized using t-SNE and Grad-CAM were then used to analyze the relationships of facade features across functional categories and differences in elemental feature representation across functional prototypes. The results show the following: (1) SE-Densenet can more efficiently identify building functions from the closely linked facade images of historic building groups, with the average accuracy reaching 85.84%. (2) Urban-rural differences exist not only in the count of spatial distributions among the CER's historic building groups, but also in a significant visual divergence between functions related to urban life and those involved in the military, industry, and railways. (3) Windows and walls occupy areas with more characteristics, but their decorative elements have a higher intensity of features. The findings could enhance the objective understanding and deeper characteristics of the historical building group system, contributing to integrated conservation and characteristic sustainability.","[Li, Peilun; Zhao, Zhiqing; Chen, Yuling; Xie, Jiayu] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China; [Li, Peilun; Zhao, Zhiqing; Chen, Yuling; Xie, Jiayu] Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Key Lab Cold Reg Urban & Rural Human Settlement En, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China; [Li, Peilun; Zhao, Zhiqing; Chen, Yuling; Xie, Jiayu] Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Natl Terr Spatial Planning & Ecol Restorat, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China; [Li, Peilun; Chen, Yuling] Natl Univ Singapore, Coll Design & Engn, Singapore 117575, Singapore; [Zhang, Bocheng] Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Suzhou 215009, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; National University of Singapore; Suzhou University of Science & Technology,"Zhao, ZQ (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Architecture, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China.;Zhao, ZQ (corresponding author), Minist Ind & Informat Technol, Key Lab Cold Reg Urban & Rural Human Settlement En, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China.;Zhao, ZQ (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Natl Terr Spatial Planning & Ecol Restorat, Harbin 150006, Peoples R China.;Zhang, BC (corresponding author), Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Suzhou 215009, Peoples R China.",peilunli@hit.edu.cn; zzq@hit.edu.cn; bocheng@mail.usts.edu.cn; yulingchen@hit.edu.cn; jiayu.xie@stu.hit.edu.cn,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2023,15,22,,,,,,,15857,10.3390/su152215857,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su152215857,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001113761500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This constant temperature set point ensures that the heat pump operates in its more efficient heat-pump mode and minimizes the risk of activating the less efficient auxiliary heating element. As an alternative to a constant set-point strategy, this paper proposes a learning agent for a thermostat with a set-back strategy. This set-back strategy relaxes the set-point temperature during convenient moments, e.g., when the occupants are not at home. Finding an optimal set-back strategy requires solving a sequential decision-making process under uncertainty, which presents two challenges. The first challenge is that for most residential buildings, a description of the thermal characteristics of the building is unavailable and challenging to obtain. The second challenge is that the relevant information on the state, i.e., the building envelope, cannot be measured by the learning agent. In order to overcome these two challenges, our paper proposes an auto-encoder coupled with a batch reinforcement learning technique. The proposed approach is validated for two building types with different thermal characteristics for heating in the winter and cooling in the summer. The simulation results indicate that the proposed learning agent can reduce the energy consumption by 4%-9% during 100 winter days and by 9%-11% during 80 summer days compared to the conventional constant set-point strategy.","[Ruelens, Frederik; Iacovella, Sandro; Belmans, Ronnie] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Elect Engn, Fac Engn, Div ELECTA, Kasteelpk Arenberg 10,Box 2445, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium; [Ruelens, Frederik; Iacovella, Sandro; Claessens, Bert J.; Belmans, Ronnie] EnergyVille, B-3600 Genk, Belgium; [Claessens, Bert J.] Flemish Inst Technol Res, Energy Dept VITO, B-2400 Mol, Belgium",KU Leuven; VITO,"Ruelens, F (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Elect Engn, Fac Engn, Div ELECTA, Kasteelpk Arenberg 10,Box 2445, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.",frederik.ruelens@esat.kuleuven.be; Sandro.iacovella@esat.kuleuven.be; Bert.claessens@vito.be; ronnie.belmans@esat.kuleuven.be,,,,,,,,41,42,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2015,8,8,,,,,8300,8318,,10.3390/en8088300,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en8088300,,,,Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000360586600042,View Full Record in Web of Science

We focus on three popular and successful architectures. First, the VGG architecture used for image classification, that takes images into labels. Second, the EDSR architecture that upscales small resolution images into high resolution images with 16 times more pixels. And finally, the CycleGAN architecture that translates images of same size from one domain to another, for example: photos to paintings of different styles, or facades to segmentation maps. In these three cases image pixels are either reduced to scalars (classification), or increased to form more complex images (super-resolution), or kept in the same vector space but in different style domains (image-to-image translation). These three architectures are largely made of linear systems. In fact, all of their learnable parameters are contained in convolutional layers, which are linear. Furthermore, we note that the action of all the non-linear layers involved are motivated by linear operations. For example, an ReLU is easily interpreted as a 1/0-mask that multiplies the input (linear) with a mask determined by the sign of each feature pixel (non-linear). A max-pooling layer selects one among a group of pixels and allows a similar interpretation by using selection masks. An instance-normalization layer subtracts a mean and divides by a standard deviation. If we fix the mean and standard deviation, it becomes linear. Now we consider a fixed input image x(0), determine the 1/0-mask for each ReLU and max-pooling, mean and variances of instance-normalizations, and fix them. The network then becomes a large linear system, that we call the Linear Interpreter. Our purpose is to study these systems arising from popular deep learning architectures. We can use well known methods and theory of linear systems to get important insights on how these networks work.","[Michelini, Pablo Navarrete; Liu, Hanwen; Lu, Yunhua; Jiang, Xingqun] BOE Technol Co Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Michelini, PN (corresponding author), BOE Technol Co Ltd, Beijing, Peoples R China.",pnavarre@boe.com.cn; liuhanwen@boe.com.cn; luyunhua@boe.com.cn; jiangxingqun@boe.com.cn,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,,,,,,,4186,4189,,10.1109/ICCVW.2019.00514,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCVW.2019.00514,,,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000554591604033,View Full Record in Web of Science

One type of segmentation, of particular interest to computer vision, is that of urban segmentation. Although recent solutions have leveraged on deep neural networks, approaches usually do not consider regularities appearing in facade structures (e.g., windows are often in groups of similar alignment, size, or spacing patterns) as well as additional urban structures such as building footprints and roofs. Moreover, both satellite and street view images are often noisy and occluded, thus getting the complete structure segmentation from a partial observation is difficult. Our key observations are that facades and other urban structures exhibit regular structures, and additional views are often available. In this paper, we present a novel framework (RFCNet) that consists of three modules to achieve multiple goals. Specifically, we propose Regularization to improve the regularities given an initial segmentation, Fusion that fuses multiple views of the segmentation, and Completion that can infer the complete structure if necessary. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively for multiple facade datasets. Furthermore, by applying our framework to other urban structures (e.g., building footprints and roofs), we demonstrate our approach can be generalized to various pattern types.","[Zhang, Xiaowei; Aliaga, Daniel] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Zhang, XW (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN USA.",zhan2597@purdue.edu,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2022,220,,,,,,,,103435,10.1016/j.cviu.2022.103435,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cviu.2022.103435,,MAY 2022,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000802026200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since asbestos-containing products are harmful to human health, their use and production have been banned in many countries. To date, no research has been undertaken to estimate the total amount of asbestos-cement products used at the country level in relation to regions or other administrative units. The objective of this paper is to present a possible new solution for developing the spatial distribution of asbestos-cement products used across the country by applying the supervised machine learning algorithm, i.e., Random Forest. Based on the results of a physical inventory taken on asbestos-cement products with the use of aerial imagery, and the application of selected features, considering the socio-economic situation of Poland, i.e., population, buildings, public finance, housing economy and municipal infrastructure, wages, salaries and social security benefits, agricultural census, entities of the national economy, labor market, environment protection, area of built-up surfaces, historical belonging to annexations, and data on asbestos manufacturing plants, best Random Forest models were computed. The selection of important variables was made in the R v.3.1.0 program and supported by the Boruta algorithm. The prediction of the amount of asbestos-cement products used in communes was executed in the randomForest package. An algorithm explaining 75.85% of the variance was subsequently used to prepare the prediction map of the spatial distribution of the amount of asbestos-cement products used in Poland. The total amount was estimated at 710,278,645 m(2) (7.8 million tons). Since the best model used data on built-up surfaces which are available for the whole of Europe, it is worth considering the use of the developed method in other European countries, as well as to assess the environmental risk of asbestos exposure to humans.","[Wilk, Ewa; Krowczyriska, Malgorzata; Zagajewski, Bogdan] Univ Warsaw, Chair Geomat & Informat Syst, Fac Geog & Reg Studies, Dept Geoinformat Cartog & Remote Sensing, PL-00927 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Wilk, E; Krówczyriska, M (corresponding author), Univ Warsaw, Chair Geomat & Informat Syst, Fac Geog & Reg Studies, Dept Geoinformat Cartog & Remote Sensing, PL-00927 Warsaw, Poland.",ewa.wilk@uw.edu.pl; mkrowczynska@uw.edu.pl,,,,,,,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2019,11,16,,,,,,,4355,10.3390/su11164355,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11164355,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000484472500099,View Full Record in Web of Science

The static PCM-built envelopes cannot flexibly adjust their heat storage and release according to the changes in weather conditions and occupants' demands, resulting in low heat storage and release effi-ciency. The application of the adaptive dynamic building envelope integrated with PCM (ADBEIPCM) addresses this problem. This paper systematically reviewed the ADBEIPCMs for the first time, including their system configuration, working principles, control strategies, and system performance. The research methods and the PCM properties were also well summarized. The results show that the ADBEIPCM can store solar energy and release heat in time to reduce building load and improve comfort mainly by rotat-ing, moving, flipping, and controlling the state of vents. This review divided the ADBEIPCMs into two cat-egories: opaque envelopes and transparent envelopes. The experiment studies and simulation studies accounted for 15.28% and 84.62% of the research on opaque envelopes, and each accounted for 50% of the research on transparent envelopes. But onsite monitoring studies on transparent envelopes only accounted for 25%. In the design of ADBEIPCM, the main encapsulation method of PCM was macro -encapsulation, and the type of PCM was mainly organic. This review analyzed the shortcomings of exist-ing studies and gave recommendations for engineers, architects, and scholars. Future research should focus on the development of novel PCMs with high strength and stability, the development of artificial intelligence-based short-term control strategies, and the development of ADBEIPCM based on bionic technology and powered by renewable energies.

These envelopes interact with multiple interconnected domains, such as daylight, indoor air quality, thermal comfort, and energy use, which can often conflict with one another. Identifying and developing suitable control strategies that can optimally manage the envelope's impact on many domains and avoid sub-optimal operations is an open challenge. Conventional approaches commonly adopted in buildings and building envelope control based on schedules or relatively simple decision trees may be unable to tackle the dynamic behaviour of adaptive envelopes. Due to their complexity, more advanced control approaches based on simulation-informed decision-making are scarce in both research and practice. In this work, we propose a multi-domain model-based control (MBC) algorithm for an adaptive facade concept based on a flexible Double Skin Facade (DSF). The proposed method, which aims for a balanced performance over different comfort domains and energy use, employs a co-simulation approach where the DSF is modelled in a Building Energy Simulation (BES) tool and the control algorithm to manage the simulation and optimize the control of the facade is developed in a generic programming language. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to design and demonstrate the effectiveness of a simulation-informed control strategy that can handle and optimise the behaviour of a complex facade by considering multiple performance objectives. The innovation of this approach lies in the MBC algorithm that selects the optimal facade state among over seventy possible states at each timestep, the practical demonstration of the feasibility in a BES tool, and the complexity of the controlled facade system. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed control approach, we compared the innovative MBC to more traditional control strategies, such as schedule and rule-based controls, revealing how it enabled the facade to achieve a better performance in all the analysed domains. By applying the MBC to three different year periods, we showed that the energy and environmental performance was within the selected comfort criteria for all the domains for>80% of the occupied hours, and an energy reduction of up to 70% was simultaneously obtained if compared to more traditional approaches. The control approach presented in this study and the simulation method employed can be used not only to improve the performance of advanced adaptive facades by providing an effective solution to the challenge of balancing multiple conflicting performance domains but also for more conventional building envelope systems that exhibit a certain degree of dynamic behaviour.

This requires accurately estimating spatio-temporal solar photovoltaic (PV) potential on urban surfaces. However, it is still a challenge to obtain a fast and accurate estimation of rooftop solar PV potential over large urban built-up areas. Thus, this study proposes a parametric-based method to estimate annual rooftop solar irradiation at a fine spatial resolution. Specifically, seven parameters (Digital Surface Model, Sky View Factor, shadow from buildings, shadow from terrain, building volume to facade ratio, slope, and aspect) are determined that having great importance in modeling rooftop solar irradiation. Three machine learning methods (Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boost Regression Tree (GBRT), and AdaBoost) trained by the selected parameters are cross-compared based on R2, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and computation time. As a case study in Hong Kong, China, the RF outperformed GBRT and AdaBoost, with R2 = 0.77 and MAE = 22.83 kWh/m2/year.

This research suggested a system that combines Building Information Modeling (BIM), machine learning, and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA II) to investigate the impact of building factors on energy usage and find the optimal design. A plugin is developed to receive sensor data and export all necessary information from BIM to MSSQL and Excel. The BIM model was imported to IDA Indoor Climate and Energy (IDA ICE) to execute an energy con-sumption simulation and then a pairwise test to produce the sample data set. To study the data set and develop a prediction model between building factors and energy usage, 11 machine learning algorithms are used. The best algorithm was Group Least Square Support Vector Machine (GLSSVM), later employed in NSGA II as the building energy consumption fitness function using Dynamo software. An NSGA II multi-objective optimization model is designed to reduce building energy consumption and optimize interior thermal comfort (measured by the predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD)). The Pareto front is calculated, and the optimum point approach is used to find the best combination of building envelope characteristics, HVAC setpoints, shading parameters, lighting, and air infiltration. The feasibility and effectiveness of the developed framework are demonstrated using a case study of an upper secondary school building in Norway; the results show that: (1) The GLSSVM has a unique capacity to forecast build-ing energy use with high accuracy: R2 of 0.99, an RMSE of 1.2, MSE of 1.44, and MAE of 0.89; (2) Building energy consumption and thermal comfort may be successfully improved by the GLSSVM-NSGA II hybrid technique, which reduces energy consumption by 37.5% and increases thermal comfort by 33.5%, respectively.

However, due to the complexity of decision-making factors and the variety of available materials, computational models are necessary to identify the most effective solutions and optimise building energy performance. This study presents an integrated framework that uses machine learning algorithms and a Petri Net control system to optimise the thermal, comfort, and energy efficiency of both vertical and horizontal building envelopes in semi-arid climate zones. The framework incorporates several passive techniques for building energy parameters, including material thickness and melting point, window types, wall insulation thickness and thermal emissivity, wall solar absorbance, window wall ratio, fenestration position, air tightness, roof solar reflectance, roof insulation thickness and conductivity (W/(m.degrees C)), and floor insulation thickness. An experiment design was developed using Box-Behnken Design-Response Surface Methodology (BBD-RSM) for statistical optimisation, which was coupled with Design Builder simulation model. The methodology was demonstrated by applying it to a residential building in Mexico.

The building patterns, materials, innovation, and use depend on the inhabitant's choices, lifestyle, and economic viability. The study focused on examining bioclimatic components of low-cost dwellings in rural coastal environments in eastern India. A survey questionnaire administered to about 1,300 respondents from 15 villages (classified as remote rural, rural, and semi-urban) yielded their perception of different dwelling environment issues. The statistical analysis of bioclimatic dimensions indicated a significant difference among the dwellings. The low-cost mud houses of the remote rural and rural areas in coastal regions often follow local practices. Besides, different dimensions covered in the survey provided insights for the comparative evaluation of different categories of dwelling units. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified the clusters and component structures of the built environment characteristics provided from the response of the villagers as their perception of the dwellings. PCA yielded three components-1) interior design (PC1, building form, partitioning of rooms, type and materials of the wall, roof and window), 2) innovation of the built environment (PC2, building envelope, insulation, and sanitation facilities), and 3) natural ventilation priority (PC3, window design, window opening, and glaze material), which together explained 69% of the total variance. The psychrometric chart provided in identifies passive design strategies in constructing dwellings to improve residents' yearly total thermal comfort hours in hot and humid regions. The relative contributions to thermal comfort hours are sun shading of windows (25.5%), a passive solar direct gain high mass (6.2%), a passive solar direct gain low mass (0.4%), and a high thermal mass, including night flush (4.3%), direct and two-stage evaporative cooling (4.3%), and natural ventilation and fan-forced ventilation cooling (2.2%).","[Bera, Mahadev; Nag, Pranab Kumar] Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educ & Res Inst, IRDM Fac Ctr, Sch Environm & Disaster Management, Kolkata, India",,"Bera, M (corresponding author), Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educ & Res Inst, IRDM Fac Ctr, Sch Environm & Disaster Management, Kolkata, India.",beramahadev1990@gmail.com,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 27,2022,8,,,,,,,,773108,10.3389/fbuil.2022.773108,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fbuil.2022.773108,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000828159200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The energy conservation standards in ECBC apply to building envelope, heating ventilation, air conditioning, lighting, service water heating, and electric power distribution. It should also be ensured that all-electric systems, transformers, energy-efficient motors, and diesel generators must meet the regulated set of mandatory requirements.

Given the heterogeneity of urban land-use types, it is difficult to differentiate different land-use types based on overhead remotely sensed data. Google Street View (GSV) images, which capture the facades of building blocks along streets, could be better used to judge the land-use types of different building blocks based on their facade appearances. Recently developed scene classification algorithms in computer vision community make it possible to categorize different photos semantically based on various image feature descriptors and machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a method to derive detailed land-use information at building block level based on scene classification algorithms and GSV images. Three image feature descriptors (i.e., scale-invariant feature transform-Fisher, histogram of oriented gradients, GIST) were used to represent GSV images of different buildings. Existing land-use maps were used to create training datasets to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for categorizing GSV images. The trained SVM classifiers were then applied to case study areas in New York City, Boston, and Houston, to predict the land-use information at building block level. Accuracy assessment results show that the proposed method is suitable for differentiating residential buildings and nonresidential buildings with an accuracy of 85% or so. Since the GSV images are publicly accessible, this proposed method would provide a new way for building block level land-use mapping in future.","[Li, Xiaojiang] MIT, Senseable City Lab, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Zhang, Chuanrong; Li, Weidong] Univ Connecticut, Dept Geog, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Connecticut,"Li, XJ (corresponding author), MIT, Senseable City Lab, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Zhang, CR (corresponding author), Univ Connecticut, Dept Geog, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",xiaojian@mit.edu,,,,,,,,61,72,,,,,,,,,,,,2017,54,6,,,,,819,835,,10.1080/15481603.2017.1338389,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2017.1338389,,,,"Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000416534800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This type of evaluation is traditionally a resource intensive process that involves onsite appraisal and in-situ measurements. In order to build more efficient and scalable methods for retrofit analysis, new sources of data could be used. Smart thermostat data, for example, provide a valuable resource, however they often lack detailed information about the building characteristics and energy loads. This paper presents and compares three methods for assessing heating characteristics of households using a dataset that does not contain heating power. The three methods are based on: (1) balance point plots, (2) the extraction of indoor temperature decay curves, and (3) the classic differential equation for indoor temperature. These methods all take a gray box approach in which physics-based and machine learning models are combined. The dataset used for this study consists of over 4,000 houses in Ontario and New York. The three methods are applied to each building and the resulting data is analyzed to determine whether the results are statistically sound. It is found that there is a positive linear correlation between characteristics derived for each method, although there is uncertainty about absolute values. This result indicates that the methods can be used to ascertain relative values for the thermal characteristics of a building. The methods suggested in this paper may therefore be used to filter heating profiles to target potential retrofit measures or other stock-level decisions.","[Baasch, Gaby; Wicikowski, Adam; Faure, Gaelle; Evins, Ralph] Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada",University of Victoria,"Baasch, G (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada.",gbaasch@uvic.ca; miwic@uvic.ca; gfaure@uvic.ca; revins@uvic.ca,,,,,,,,12,13,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,,,,,,,223,232,,10.1145/3360322.3360836,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3360322.3360836,,,,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Transportation Science & Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000557872600029,View Full Record in Web of Science

We assume that the vehicle's route is filled with sequential places that the vehicle sees in the same order as it travels a pre-defined route. We handle three distinct challenges for this problem. First, since most places have a very small distinctiveness, we make the feature extraction algorithm conscious of the strong features like building facades and signboards. Second, there may be several dynamic entities that disallow reliable place recognition, and therefore we learn the model so as to eliminate the dynamic objects. Third, to minimize mis-classifications due to the non-distinctiveness of several places, we restrict the model to output smooth trajectories to minimize mis-classifications, attacking the sequential nature of the visual place recognition problem. The test domain may be somewhat different from the domain in which the place dataset is made, and we, therefore, use transfer learning to extract similar features.

However, the widely used simulation-based design is facing several challenges, such as the labor-intensive modeling process and the performance gaps between design stage estimations and operational energy use. For these reasons, artificial intelligent methods are expected by designers to improve the efficiency and reliability of building energy-efficient design. To date, there has not been a practical data-driven design method of envelopes. This study aimed at exploring data-driven building energy-efficient design of envelopes based on their quantified impacts. A feature selection method and a game-theoretic method were applied to quantify the impacts of envelopes on space heating and cooling energy, which were performed on two building datasets, one of which is from the U.S. and the other from China. Random forest classifiers were developed to conduct the study. Based on discovered energy patterns and quantified impacts of envelopes on energy consumption, a rectified linear design method of envelopes was proposed with the idea of improving the performance of high-impact envelopes. Besides, a validation study was conducted on two office buildings in the hot-summer cold-winter region. To design the envelopes of a building, the data-driven analysis was driven by its similar buildings other than the whole dataset. Moreover, a detailed energy simulation was conducted to evaluate the energy performance of different design solutions. The results showed that compared with baseline design solutions, new strategies could save 1.05%-21.2% energy for space heating and cooling for these two case buildings.

We use Siamese convolutional neural networks (SCNN) that take two crack pattern images as inputs and output scalar similarity measures. We focus on 2D masonry facades with and without openings. The image pairs are generated using a statistics-based approach and labelled by 28 structural engineering experts. When the data is randomly split into fit and test data, the SCNNs can achieve good performance on the test data (R-2 approximate to 0.9). When the SCNNs are tested on unseen archetypes, their test R-2 values are on average 1% lower than the case where all archetypes are seen during the training. These very good results indicate that SCNNs can generalise to unseen cases without compromising their performance. Although the analyses are restricted to the considered synthetic images, the results are promising and the approach is general.","[Rozsas, Arpad; Slobbe, Arthur; Pillai, Krishna Ajithkumar] TNO Bldg Infrastruct & Maritime, Dept Struct Reliabil, Delft, Netherlands; [Huizinga, Wyke; Kruithof, Maarten; Kleijn, Kelvin] TNO Def Safety & Secur, Dept Intelligent Imaging, The Hague, Netherlands; [Pillai, Krishna Ajithkumar; Giardina, Giorgia] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Geosci & Engn, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands",Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research; Delft University of Technology,"Giardina, G (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Dept Geosci & Engn, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands.",g.giardina@tudelft.nl,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 2,2023,17,1,,,SI,,147,169,,10.1080/15583058.2022.2134062,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15583058.2022.2134062,,OCT 2022,,"Architecture; Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000876588100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This leaves a dearth of knowledge on the influences of other disparate factors, such as the aesthetics of the building facade. This paper examines the effects of a deteriorated external wall paint on the tenants, rent and take-up of housing located in a high-end housing estate in Akure, Nigeria. The logic is to examine the place of aesthetics among the general factors affecting take-up and rental prices. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through census from 133 respondents residing in houses with deteriorated external wall paint. It applied both descriptive and multinomial logistic regression (MLR) to analyse the data. Findings Findings reveal that close to 60% of the respondents were psychologically affected by the visible deterioration of external wall paint. This translated to a significance reduction in rent compared with the rental prices of similar houses the appearance of which was not deteriorated. Generally, this study found that aesthetics paled into insignificance in the analysis of the general factors affecting housing take-up and rent. However, it ranked first when these were analysed on the structural characteristics of the house only. This is consistent with findings from the MLR parameter estimate, which shows that those who were psychologically affected are more likely to pay a 15% increase in their current rent to take up a similar house without paint deterioration. Practical implications The findings of this study have implications on practice and theory. First, while the location mantra is a key determinant of rental prices in theory, in practice, rent on comparable houses could differ if the aesthetics of the external wall paint is compromised. This implies an avoidable loss of rent to the owner of a property who compromises the aesthetic quality of the external wall paint in a high-end location where affordability is arguably high. The implication on public authority is that a lower rent may have a negative implication on government revenue and specifically property tax which is normally based on market rent of a property. Originality/value A novel quality of the study is that it separates the structural characteristics of a house from the general factors in order to examine the specific effect of deteriorated aesthetics of external wall paint on take-up and rent.","[Akinbogun, Solomon Pelumi; Aigbbavboa, Clinton] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn Built Environm, Dept Construct Management & Quant Surveying, Doornfontein Campus, Doornfontein, South Africa; [Gumbo, Trynos] Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn Built Environm, Dept Town & Reg Planning, Doornfontein, South Africa",University of Johannesburg; University of Johannesburg,"Akinbogun, SP (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn Built Environm, Dept Construct Management & Quant Surveying, Doornfontein Campus, Doornfontein, South Africa.",akinbogunpelumi@yahoo.com; caigbavboa@uj.ac.za; tgumbo@uj.ac.za,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 19,2020,38,5,,,,,683,697,,10.1108/PM-11-2019-0066,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/PM-11-2019-0066,,,,Management,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000575110100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Conventionally, the facade panel picking position is done manually by trial and error. The designer chooses a place to pick up a facade piece within reach of the robot arm, and then simulates the entire pick and place process in a digital model before applying to the assembly on the construction job site. After that the designer might detect errors, collisions, or singularities, which require the designer to modify the position of picking by changing the location or orientation of the module, thus repeating the simulation cycle until they reach a satisfactory result with no errors or collisions. This work is usually considered monotonous, inefficient, and time consuming. Therefore, this research proposes an optimization process implemented in design stage of construction project via static performance criteria in order to automatically search for the best picking location within the reach of the robot arm. The goal is to automate the process of robot location finding and solve the limitations of modular robot assembly simulation processes in order to allow for effective execution during the robotic construction implementation. The proposed approach, called iFobot, consists of three modules: Facade Generative Modeling (iFobot-D), Robot Position Optimization (iFobot-B), and Culminating Feedback to BIM (iFobot-L). Specifically, the scope of the paper is limited to the robot arm and facade picking and placing location finding processes. This research al lows initial assessment of the possible assembly process as regards the dimensions of modules and hence the overall dimensions of the system, which subsequently influences assembly implementation in the construction job site. A set of generative algorithms were developed using commercially developed visual programming language that automatically populate facade modules on the building envelope, find the robot and facade assembly locations with their quantity take-off, and integrate the module with the BIM environment. A case study has been developed to validate and test the proposed system. The results prove that the system generates optimized locations for the robot arm workstations with the lowest possible collision and reachability rate while addressing robot operation time reduction, thus reducing risks encountered during facade assembly and increasing productivity. Moreover, the iFobot is predicted to influence decision making during the facade assembly process on a physical construction job site.","[Ali, Ahmed Khairadeen; Song, Hayub] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Architecture & Bldg Sci, Seoul 06974, South Korea; [Lee, One Jae] Haenglim Architecture & Engn Co, 201 Songpa daero, Seoul 05854, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Song, H (corresponding author), Chung Ang Univ, Sch Architecture & Bldg Sci, Seoul 06974, South Korea.",ahmedshingaly@gmail.com; o.lee@haenglim.com; hysong@cau.ac.kr,,,,,,,,19,19,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2021,33,,,,,,,,101556,10.1016/j.jobe.2020.101556,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2020.101556,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000599645900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this work, a multi-objective optimization approach, based on a smart surrogate model, has been developed to minimize the energy consumption, improve the thermal comfort of the occupants and increase the energy self-sufficiency of residential buildings. For this purpose, two main phases have been considered: the first one is related to the development of the surrogate model, based on machine learning utilities, in particular Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and the second is related to the optimization process, performed by means of the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (MOPSO). This approach has been applied to a typical Moroccan building, Ground Floor thorn First Floor (GFFF), in different regulatory climate zones. The results show that the approach was successfully implemented using TRNSYS, Matlab and other numerical simulation tools, leading to different solutions in terms of building envelope design. The best-fit solution achieved a huge improvement potential in most climate zones, averaging about 75%, 50% and 85% respectively for energy consumption, thermal comfort and energy self-sufficiency of the studied building. Finally, we strongly recommend this approach to the various stakeholders in this field, including de-signers, engineers, architects, consulting firms, etc., since the results have proven its effectiveness as a very promising step towards designing Comfortable and Nearly Zero Energy Buildings. Future work will focus on the implementation of a hardware device that is able to perform all the steps of the proposed framework for possible pre-project optimizations.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Such is the case of the study of air change rates (ACHs) in buildings for their complex mechanisms and high variability. It is not uncommon for the referred applications to be costly and impractical in both time and computation, resulting in the use of simplified methodologies and setups. The incorporation of airtightness limits to quantify adequate ACHs in national transpositions of the Energy Performance Building Directive (EPBD) exemplifies the issue. This research presents a roadmap for developing an alternative instrument, a compliance tool built with a Machine Learning (ML) framework, that overcomes some simplification issues regarding policy implementation while fulfilling practitioners' needs and general societal use. It relies on dwellings' terrain, geometric and airtightness characteristics, and meteorological data. Results from previous work on a region with a mild heating season in southern Europe apply in training and testing the proposed tool. The tool outputs numerical information on the air change rates performance of the building envelope, and a label, accordingly. On the test set, the best regressor showed mean absolute errors (MAE) below 1.02% for all the response variables, while the best classifier presented an average accuracy of 97.32%. These results are promising for the generalization of this methodology, with potential for application at regional, national, and European Union levels. The developed tool could be a complementary asset to energy certification programmes of either public or private initiatives. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Two methods for non-linear dimensionality reduction, isomap and maximum variance unfolding, were applied to a set of Hough arrays (for tines) of the given images.

It has attracted much attention for providing the basic semantic information for numerous applications. Over the past 10 years, visual tracking has made a great progress, but huge challenges still exist in many real-world applications. The facade of a target can be transformed significantly by pose changing, occlusion, and sudden movement, which possibly leads to a sudden target loss. This paper builds a hybrid tracker combining the deep feature method and correlation filter to solve this challenge, and verifies its powerful characteristics. Specifically, an effective visual tracking method is proposed to address the problem of low tracking accuracy due to the limitations of traditional artificial feature models, then rich hiearchical features of Convolutional Neural Networks are used to make the multi-layer features fusion improve the tracker learning accuracy.

Little research on this topic focused on the collection of damage data, the understanding of damage mechanisms and the deepening of data analysis methods. In this paper, the relative contribution of different failure mechanisms to the occurrence of rainstorm damage is investigated, as well as the extent to which these mechanisms relate to weather variables. For a case study in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, a property level home insurance database of around 3100 water-related damage claims was analysed. The records include comprehensive transcripts of communication between insurer, insured and damage assessment experts, which allowed claims to be classified according to their actual damage cause. The results show that roof and wall leakage is the most frequent failure mechanism causing precipitation-related claims, followed by blocked roof gutters, melting snow and sewer flooding. Claims related to sewer flooding were less present in the data, but are associated with significantly larger claim sizes than claims in the majority class, i. e. roof and wall leakages. Rare events logistic regression analysis revealed that maximum rainfall intensity and rainfall volume are significant predictors for the occurrence probability of precipitation-related claims. Moreover, it was found that claims associated with rainfall intensities smaller than 7-8mm in a 60-min window are mainly related to failure processes in the private domain, such as roof and wall leakages. For rainfall events that exceed the 7-8mmh(-1) threshold, the failure of systems in the public domain, such as sewer systems, start to contribute considerably to the overall occurrence probability of claims. The communication transcripts, however, lacked information to be conclusive about to which extent sewer-related claims were caused by overloading of sewer systems or failure of system components.","[Spekkers, M.

In urban areas, it exacerbates the urban heat island phenomenon. It impacts the health of the inhabitants and the sensation of thermal discomfort felt in urban areas. Thus, it is necessary to estimate as well as possible the air temperature at any point of a territory, in particular in view of the ongoing rationalization of the network of fixed meteorological stations of Meteo-France. Understanding the air temperature is increasingly in demand to input quantitative models related to a wide range of fields, such as hydrology, ecology, or climate change studies. This study thus proposes to model air temperature, measured during four mobile campaigns carried out during the summer months, between 2016 and 2019, in Lyon (France), in clear sky weather, using regression models based on 33 explanatory variables from traditionally used data, data from remote sensing by LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), or Landsat 8 satellite acquisition. Three types of statistical regression were experimented: partial least square regression, multiple linear regression, and a machine learning method, the random forest regression. For example, for the day of 30 August 2016, multiple linear regression explained 89% of the variance for the study days, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of only 0.23 degrees C. Variables such as surface temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) have a strong impact on the estimation model. This study contributes to the emergence of urban cooling systems. The solutions available vary. For example, they may include increasing the proportion of vegetation on the ground, facades, or roofs, increasing the number of basins and water bodies to promote urban cooling, choosing water-retaining materials, humidifying the pavement, increasing the number of public fountains and foggers, or creating shade with stretched canvas.","[Alonso, Lucille; Renard, Florent] Univ Jean Moulin Lyon 3, UMR CNRS 5600 Environm City & Soc, Dept Geog & Spatial Planning, F-69007 Lyon, France",Universite Jean Moulin Lyon 3,"Alonso, L (corresponding author), Univ Jean Moulin Lyon 3, UMR CNRS 5600 Environm City & Soc, Dept Geog & Spatial Planning, F-69007 Lyon, France.",lucille.alonso@univ-lyon3.fr; florent.renard@univ-lyon3.fr,,,,,,,,17,18,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2020,12,15,,,,,,,2434,10.3390/rs12152434,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12152434,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000559113500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Energy consumption across all sectors is identified as a crucial contributor to this challenge, with a number of legislative and regulatory frameworks and commitments to be introduced every year. In response to these trends, the concept of exploiting a building's thermal mass through the integration of phase change materials (PCMs) enhances the ability of building elements to reserve and deliver large amounts of energy during phase transitions. However, the incorporation of PCMs into building elements requires the thorough understanding of their thermal behaviour. This study evaluates and predicts the thermophysical properties of mineral particles carrying PCMs and coated with a cementitious layer able to be utilised as fillers in construction applications. By employing deep learning and predictive modelling techniques, the numerical data-driven model developed in this paper enhances accuracy and efficiency in property estimation and prediction, facilitating material selection, system design, and optimisation. A model in a MATLAB simulation environment is presented, evaluating and predicting the thermophysical properties of semi-organic particles able to enhance building envelope thermal mass as a hybrid energy storage solution. These findings show the time needed for a building block to undergo cooling, demonstrating a clear upgrade in the thermal discharge of the walls. Substituting traditional EP with PCM-enhanced EP leads to a minimum reduction of 1 & DEG;C per hour in the discharge rate, thereby extending the comfort duration of indoor spaces without necessitating additional space heating. These models offer the potential for assessing diverse material compositions and usage scenarios, offering valuable insights to aid decisions in optimizing building energy efficiency.","[Politi, Chrysa; Peppas, Antonis; Taxiarchou, Maria] Natl Tech Univ Athens NTUA, Sch Min & Met Engn, Athens 15780, Greece",,"Politi, C (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens NTUA, Sch Min & Met Engn, Athens 15780, Greece.",chrysapol@metal.ntua.gr; peppas@metal.ntua.gr; taxiarh@metal.ntua.gr,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2023,15,17,,,,,,,12863,10.3390/su151712863,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su151712863,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001062342600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many previous studies are focus on detecting damages in factory tiles for the quality control purposes, although there has not been much study on tile damages for historical temples. This paper proposed an image-based system to detect damages in tiles using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on a temple facade. The dataset was created by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and a digital camera from a historical temple in Bangkok, Thailand. In the proposed work, CNN was trained on various image patches sizes. The detection accuracy of the system was found to be 95% in the validation data and 91% on the testing data. The results of the proposed system were compared with a system using hand-crafted features, including 2D wavelet transforms with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

Such classification is usually a patch-wise or pixel-wise labeling over the whole image. But for many applications, such as urban population density mapping or urban utility planning, a classification map based on individual buildings is much more informative. However, such semantic classification still poses some fundamental challenges, for example, how to retrieve fine boundaries of individual buildings. In this paper, we proposed a general framework for classifying the functionality of individual buildings. The proposed method is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which classify facade structures from street view images, such as Google Street View, in addition to remote sensing images which usually only show roof structures. Geographic information was utilized to mask out individual buildings, and to associate the corresponding street view images. We created a benchmark dataset which was used for training and evaluating CNNs. In addition, the method was applied to generate building classification maps on both region and city scales of several cities in Canada and the US. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

Convolutional neural networks have shown promising results in window extraction. Most existing methods segment a facade into semantic categories and subsequently employ regularization based on the structure of manmade architectures. These methods merely concern the optimization of individual windows, without considering the spatial areas or relationships of windows. This paper presents a novel windows instance segmentation method based on Mask R-CNN architecture. The method features a spatial attention region proposal network and a relation module-enhanced head network. First, an attention module is introduced in the region proposal network to generate a spatial attention map, then the attention map is multiplied with the objectness scores of the classification branch. Second, for the head network, relation modules are added to model the spatial relationships between proposals. Appearance and geometric features are combined for instance recognition. Furthermore, we constructed a new window instance segmentation dataset with 1200 annotated images. With our dataset, the average precisions of our method on detection and segmentation increased from 53.1% and 53.7% to 56.4% and 56.7% compared with Mask R-CNN.

The network is divided into two parts: generator and discriminator; the generator proposes a attention transfer network cross layer based on the U-NET architecture; after the input image is encoded, the attention transfer network cross layer is used to reconstruct the encoding feature map of each layer. The decoding is performed by fusing the skip connection with the corresponding potential feature in the multi-scale decoder, solving the information loss between the codec network layers. Moreover, each decoding layer of the multi-scale decoder is prompted to generate consistent content, and finally the repaired image is obtained. After the decoding is completed, the decoding feature map of each layer is converted into a multi-scale RGB image, and the reconstruction L1 loss is applied on each scale; by minimizing the adversarial loss, the discriminator can determine the authenticity of the repaired image; the perceptual loss and style loss are introduced to judge the output image, so as to restrict the generator to generate more realistic and reasonable content. A qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis is performed on the Celeba, Facade, and Places2 with the current mainstream image inpainting algorithms. The results show that the repair results in this paper are better than others in terms of mean L1 loss, PSNR, and SSIM, and more in line with human visual characteristics. The attention transfer network cross layer proposed in this paper can effectively reconstruct the more detailed coding feature map, and it can play an active guiding role in the coding process by using skip connection; the image inpainting network can generate content that is highly consistent with the structure and semantics of the real image when repairing large-area irregular defect areas, which is more in line with the human visual experience.","[Yingnan, Shi; Yao, Fan] Xizang Minzu Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Xian Yang, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Ningjun, Zhang] Zhengzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China",Xizang Minzu University,"Yao, F (corresponding author), Xizang Minzu Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Xian Yang, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",fanyao11241983@163.com,,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2021,242,,,,,,,,167101,10.1016/j.ijleo.2021.167101,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijleo.2021.167101,,JUN 2021,,Optics,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000683394100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Instead, these devices share gradients, parameters, or other model updates, with a central party (e.g., a company) coordinating the training. Because data never leaves personal devices, FL is often presented as privacy-preserving. Yet, recently it was shown that this protection is but a thin facade, as even a passive, honest-but-curious attacker observing gradients can reconstruct data of individual users contributing to the protocol. In this work, we show a novel data reconstruction attack which allows an active and dishonest central party to efficiently extract user data from the received gradients. While prior work on data reconstruction in FL relies on solving computationally expensive optimization problems or on making easily detectable modifications to the shared model's architecture or parameters, in our attack the central party makes inconspicuous changes to the shared model's weights before sending them out to the users. We call the modified weights of our attack trap weights. Our active attacker is able to recover user data perfectly, i.e., with zero error, even when this data stems from the same class. Recovery comes with near-zero costs: the attack requires no complex optimization objectives. Instead, our attacker exploits inherent data leakage from model gradients and simply amplifies this effect by maliciously altering the weights of the shared model through the trap weights. These specificities enable our attack to scale to fully-connected and convolutional deep neural networks trained with large mini-batches of data. For example, for the high-dimensional vision dataset ImageNet, we perfectly reconstruct more than 50% of the training data points from mini-batches as large as 100 data points. In textual tasks, such as IMDB sentiment analysis, more than 65% of data points from mini-batches containing 100 data points can be perfectly reconstructed.","[Boenisch, Franziska; Dziedzic, Adam; Schuster, Roei; Shamsabadi, Ali Shahin; Shumailov, Ilia; Papernot, Nicolas] Vector Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Dziedzic, Adam; Papernot, Nicolas] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Shamsabadi, Ali Shahin] Alan Turing Inst, London, England",University of Toronto,"Boenisch, F (corresponding author), Vector Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,,2023,,,,,,,175,199,,10.1109/EuroSP57164.2023.00020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/EuroSP57164.2023.00020,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001046858400011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The grammar is extended by parameters and constraints, which are learned based on a statistical relational learning method using Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). MLNs enforce the topological and geometric constraints. MLNs address uncertainty explicitly and provide probabilistic inference. They are able to deal with partial observations caused by occlusions. Uncertain projective geometry is used to deal with the uncertainty of the observations. Learning is based on a large building database covering different building styles and facade structures.

However, due to the sensor noise, high redundancy, incompleteness, and complexity of airborne LiDAR systems, point cloud classification is challenging. Traditional point cloud classification methods mostly focus on the development of handcrafted point geometry features and employ machine learning-based classification models to conduct point classification. In recent years, the advances of deep learning models have caused researchers to shift their focus towards machine learning-based models, specifically deep neural networks, to classify airborne LiDAR point clouds. These learning-based methods start by transforming the unstructured 3D point sets to regular 2D representations, such as collections of feature images, and then employ a 2D CNN for point classification. Moreover, these methods usually need to calculate additional local geometry features, such as planarity, sphericity and roughness, to make use of the local structural information in the original 3D space. Nonetheless, the 3D to 2D conversion results in information loss. In this paper, we propose a directionally constrained fully convolutional neural network (D-FCN) that can take the original 3D coordinates and LiDAR intensity as input; thus, it can directly apply to unstructured 3D point clouds for semantic labeling. Specifically, we first introduce a novel directionally constrained point convolution (D-Conv) module to extract locally representative features of 3D point sets from the projected 2D receptive fields. To make full use of the orientation information of neighborhood points, the proposed D-Conv module performs convolution in an orientation-aware manner by using a directionally constrained nearest neighborhood search. Then, we design a multiscale fully convolutional neural network with downsampling and upsampling blocks to enable multiscale point feature learning. The proposed D-FCN model can therefore process input point cloud with arbitrary sizes and directly predict the semantic labels for all the input points in an end-to-end manner. Without involving additional geometry features as input, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance on the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) 3D labeling benchmark dataset. The results show that our model achieves a new stateof-the-art performance on powerline, car, and facade categories. Moreover, to demonstrate the generalization abilities of the proposed method, we conduct further experiments on the 2019 Data Fusion Contest Dataset. Our proposed method achieves superior performance than the comparing methods and accomplishes an overall accuracy of 95.6% and an average F1 score of 0.810.","[Wen, Congcong; Yang, Lina; Li, Xiang; Peng, Ling; Chi, Tianhe] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wen, Congcong; Yang, Lina; Li, Xiang; Peng, Ling; Chi, Tianhe] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wen, Congcong; Li, Xiang] NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, New York, NY USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering","Li, X (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xl1845@nyu.edu,,,,,,,,71,83,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2020,162,,,,,,50,62,,10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.02.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.02.004,,,,"Geography, Physical; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000527709200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, DL models are black-box methods hard to debug, interpret, and certify. DL alone cannot provide explanations that can be validated by a non technical audience such as end-users or domain experts. In contrast, symbolic AI systems that convert concepts into rules or symbols - such as knowledge graphs - are easier to explain. However, they present lower generalization and scaling capabilities. A very important challenge is to fuse DL representations with expert knowledge. One way to address this challenge, as well as the performance-explainability trade-off is by leveraging the best of both streams without obviating domain expert knowledge. In this paper, we tackle such problem by considering the symbolic knowledge is expressed in form of a domain expert knowledge graph. We present the eXplainable Neural-symbolic learning (X-NeSyL) methodology, designed to learn both symbolic and deep representations, together with an explainability metric to assess the level of alignment of machine and human expert explanations. The ultimate objective is to fuse DL representations with expert domain knowledge during the learning process so it serves as a sound basis for explainability. In particular, X-NeSyL methodology involves the concrete use of two notions of explanation, both at inference and training time respectively: (1) EXPLANet: Expert-aligned eXplainable Part-based cLAssifier NETwork Architecture, a compositional convolutional neural network that makes use of symbolic representations, and (2) SHAP-Backprop, an explainable AI-informed training procedure that corrects and guides the DL process to align with such symbolic representations in form of knowledge graphs. We showcase X-NeSyL methodology using MonuMAI dataset for monument facade image classification, and demonstrate that with our approach, it is possible to improve explainability at the same time as performance.","[Diaz-Rodriguez, Natalia; Sanchez, Jules; Franchi, Gianni; Filliat, David] Inst Polytech Paris, U2IS, ENSTA, F-91762 Palaiseau, France; [Diaz-Rodriguez, Natalia; Sanchez, Jules; Franchi, Gianni] Inria Flowers, F-91762 Palaiseau, France; [Donadello, Ivan] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy; [Diaz-Rodriguez, Natalia; Tabik, Siham; Herrera, Francisco] Univ Granada, DaSCI Andalusian Inst Data Sci & Computat Intelli, Granada 18071, Spain; [Herrera, Francisco] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Cruz, Policarpo] Univ Granada, Dept Art Hist, Granada 18071, Spain; [Diaz-Rodriguez, Natalia; Herrera, Francisco] Univ Granada, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Granada 18071, Spain; [Montes, Rosana] Univ Granada, Dept Software Engn, Granada 18071, Spain",Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Granada; King Abdulaziz University; University of Granada; University of Granada; University of Granada,"Díaz-Rodríguez, N (corresponding author), Inst Polytech Paris, U2IS, ENSTA, F-91762 Palaiseau, France.;Díaz-Rodríguez, N (corresponding author), Inria Flowers, F-91762 Palaiseau, France.;Díaz-Rodríguez, N (corresponding author), Univ Granada, DaSCI Andalusian Inst Data Sci & Computat Intelli, Granada 18071, Spain.;Díaz-Rodríguez, N (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Granada 18071, Spain.",nataliadiaz@ugr.es,,,,,,,,27,27,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2022,79,,,,,,58,83,,10.1016/j.inffus.2021.09.022,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.inffus.2021.09.022,,OCT 2021,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000716752300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper proposes a second-order generative image inpainting model based on edge and feature self-arrangement constraints. The model consists of two parts: edge repair network and image repair network. Based on the self-encoder, the edge repair network generates the edges in the defect area according to the known information of the image and improves the edge repair effect by minimizing the adversarial loss and feature matching loss. The image inpainting network fills the defect area with the edge repair result as a priori condition. On the basis of U-Net, the feature self-arrangement module (FSM) is proposed to reconstruct the coding features of a specific scale, and the reconstructed feature skips to connect the decoding layer of the same scale, and it is fused with the upper layer underlying features for decoding. Meanwhile, guide loss, adversarial loss, and reconstruction loss are introduced to narrow the difference between the repaired image and the original image. The experimental results show that the inpainting results of the proposed model have stronger structural connectivity and clearer textures and the performance of PSNR, SSIM, and mean L1 loss in the Celeba, Facade, and Places2 is better than other inpainting methods, indicating that the algorithm can produce an inpainting effect with highly connected structure, reasonable semantics, and fine details.","[Yao, Fan] Xizang Minzu Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Xian Yang, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Chu, Yanli] Engn Univ PAP, Coll Equipment Management & Support, Xian 710086, Peoples R China",Xizang Minzu University,"Yao, F (corresponding author), Xizang Minzu Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Xian Yang, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",fannyaoo@xzmu.edu.cn; chuyanli1101@163.com,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 12,2022,2022,,,,,,,,5904043,10.1155/2022/5904043,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/5904043,,,,Mathematical & Computational Biology; Neurosciences,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000876419800017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Survey of traditional masonry also ostensibly conforms to this approach but, due to the sheer volume of masonry units composing walls, it is often prohibitively time consuming, exceptionally complex and ultimately costly. Notable features of such survey work for ashlar stone types require each stone to be labelled and overlaid with information relative to condition. Further hindering these already costly operations, it has been shown that the accuracy of reporting, including labelling the manifestation of defects and defect diagnosis, is subjective, depending upon the expertise and experience of those evaluating the fabric. Moving beyond these preliminary survey and reporting stages, this situation gives rise to variable repair and maintenance strategies that can have significant cost implications and can debase fundamental conservation activities. The development of digital technologies, such as terrestrial laser scanning, and advancements in novel computer vision statistical techniques can help produce accurate representation of buildings that can be subsequently rapidly processed, achieving many tangible survey functions with greater inherent objectivity. In this paper, an innovative strategy for automatic detection and classification of defects in digitised ashlar masonry walling is presented. The classification method is based on the use of supervised machine learning algorithms, assisted by surveyors' strategies and expertise to identify defective individual masonry units, through to broader global patterns for groups of stones. The proposed approach has been tested on the main facade of the Chapel Royal in Stirling Castle (Scotland), demonstrating its potential for ashlar masonry forms of wall construction. It is important to recognise that the findings are not limited to this culturally significant building and will be of high value to almost innumerable ashlar-built structures worldwide. The research ultimately attempts to reduce the degree of subjectivity in classifying defects, on a scale and rapidity hitherto beyond traditional project cost constraints. Importantly, it is recognised that through automation more effective utilisation of resources that would have been traditionally spent on survey can be redeployed to support fabric intervention or routine maintenance operations.","[Valero, Enrique; Bosche, Frederic] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Inst Infrastruct & Environm, Edinburgh EH9 3FB, Midlothian, Scotland; [Forster, Alan] Heriot Watt Univ, Inst Sustainable Bldg Design, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hyslop, Ewan; Wilson, Lyn; Turmel, Aurelie] Hist Environm Scotland, Salisbury Pl,Longmore House, Edinburgh EH9 1SH, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh; Heriot Watt University,"Valero, E (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Engn, Inst Infrastruct & Environm, Edinburgh EH9 3FB, Midlothian, Scotland.",e.valero@ed.ac.uk,,,,,,,,71,72,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2019,106,,,,,,,,102846,10.1016/j.autcon.2019.102846,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2019.102846,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000488136600014,View Full Record in Web of Science

We automatically generate a small number of most likely hypotheses and provide probabilities for each of them. Probability density functions of model parameters which in most cases are non Gaussian and multimodal are learned from training data and approximated by Gaussian mixtures. Relations between model parameters are represented by non-linear constraints. For stochastic reasoning we design and apply a special kind of Bayesian networks which involves both discrete as well as continuous variables, a scenario which often suggests the use of approximate inference which however is infeasible in the face of a huge number of competing model hypotheses. In order to be able to scan huge model spaces avoiding the pitfalls of approximate reasoning and to exploit the potential of both observations and models, we combined Bayesian networks with constraint logic programs. We designed a method which breaks down the problem into a feasible number of subproblems for which exact inference can be applied. We illustrate our approach with building facades and demonstrate that particularly for buildings with strong symmetries number and position of windows can be deduced on the basis of ground plans alone.

We assess the transferability of this model by training on one scene and testing to another with significantly different illumination conditions and/or different content. This results in a significant (similar to 45%) decrease in the model precision and recall as does training on all scenes at once and testing on the individual scenes. These results suggest that while CNNs are powerful tools for pixel-level classification of very high-resolution spectral data of urban environments, retraining between scenes may be necessary. Furthermore, we test the dependence of the model on several instrument- and data-specific parameters including reduced spectral resolution (down to 15 spectral channels) and number of available training instances. The results are strongly class-dependent; however, we find that the classification of natural materials is particularly robust, especially the Vegetation class with a precision and recall >94% for all scenes and model transfers and >90% with only a single training instance.","[Qamar, Farid; Dobler, Gregory] Univ Delaware, Biden Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Qamar, Farid] Univ Delaware, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Dobler, Gregory] Univ Delaware, Dept Phys & Astron, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Dobler, Gregory] Univ Delaware, Data Sci Inst, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Dobler, Gregory] NYU, Ctr Urban Sci & Progress, New York, NY 11201 USA",University of Delaware; University of Delaware; University of Delaware; University of Delaware; New York University,"Qamar, F (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Biden Sch Publ Policy & Adm, Newark, DE 19716 USA.;Qamar, F (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",qamar@udel.edu; gdobler@udel.edu,,,,,,,,12,12,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2020,12,16,,,,,,,2540,10.3390/rs12162540,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12162540,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000565448000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

One of the main steps in evaluating potential human and economic losses in a seismic risk assessment, is the development of inventory databases for existing building stocks in terms of load-resisting structural systems and material characteristics (building typologies classification). The common approach for building stock model classification is to perform extensive fieldwork and walk-down surveys in representative areas of a city, and in some cases using random sample surveys of geounits. This procedure is time and cost consuming, and subject to personal interpretation: to mitigate these costs, we have introduced a machine learning methodology to automate this classification based on publicly available image databases. We here use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically identify the different building typologies in the city of Oslo, Norway, based on facade images taken from in-situ fieldwork and from Google Street View. We use transfer learning of state-of-the-art pretrained CNNs to predict the Model Building Typology. The present article attempts to categorize Oslo's building stock in five main building typologies: timber, unreinforced masonry, reinforced concrete, composite (steel-reinforced concrete) and steel. This method results in 89% accuracy score for timber buildings, though only 35% success score for steel-reinforced concrete buildings. We here classify and define for the first time a relevant set of five typologies for the Norwegian building typologies as observed in Oslo and applicable at national level.

To solve the problems, this paper proposes a second-order generative image inpainting model based on Structural Constraints and Multi-scale Feature Fusion (SCMFF). The SCMFF model consists of two parts: edge repair network and image inpainting network. The edge repair network combines the auto-encoder with the Dilated Residual Feature Pyramid Fusion (DRFPF) module, which improves the representation of multi-level semantic information and structural details of images, thus achieves better edge repair. Then, the image inpainting network embeds the Dilated Multi-scale Attention Fusion (DMAF) module in the auto-encoder for texture synthesis with the real edge as the prior condition, and achieves fine-grained inpainting under the edge constraint by aggregating the long-distance features of different dimensions. Finally, the edge repair results are used to replace the real edge, and the two networks are fused and trained to achieve end-to-end repair from the masked image to the complete image. The model is compared with the advanced methods on datasets including Celeba, Facade and Places2. The quantitative results show that the four metrics of LPIPS, MAE, PSNR and SSIM are improved by 0.0124-0.0211, 3.787-6.829, 2.934dB-5.730dB and 0.034-0.132, respectively.

However, what remains unclear is to what extent urban dwellers' everyday life can be explained by the visual clues of the urban environment. In this paper, we address this question by applying a computer vision model to 27 million street view images across 80 counties in the United States. Then, we use the spatial distribution of notable urban features identified through the street view images, such as street furniture, sidewalks, building facades, and vegetation, to predict the socioeconomic profiles of their immediate neighborhood. Our results show that these urban features alone can account for up to 83% of the variance in people's travel behavior, 62% in poverty status, 64% in crime, and 68% in health behaviors. The results outperform models based on points of interest (POI), population, and other demographic data alone. Moreover, incorporating urban features captured from street view images can improve the explanatory power of these other methods by 5% to 25%. We propose urban visual intelligence as a process to uncover hidden city profiles, infer, and synthesize urban information with computer vision and street view images.

The method involves the use of multi-level image features, a bottom-up feature extraction procedure to produce regions of interest through monoscopic analysis, and then a coarse-to-fine feature matching strategy to characterise and match the regions in a stereoscopic model. Feature extraction from typical urban Manhattan scenes is based on line segments. Windows are re-organised based on the spatial constraints of line segments and the homogeneous structure of the spectrum. Facades as regions of interest are successfully constructed with a remarkable single edge and evidence from windows to get rid of occlusion. Feature matching is hierarchically performed beginning from distinctive facades and regularly distributed windows to the sub-pixel point primitives. The proposed strategy can effectively solve ambiguity and multi-solution problems in the complex urban scene matching process, particularly repetitive and poor-texture facades in oblique view.","[Yang, Xiucheng; Qin, Xuebin; Wang, Jun; Wang, Jianhua; Ye, Xin; Qin, Qiming] Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & Geog Informat Syst, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Qin, QM (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & Geog Informat Syst, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",xiuchengyang@163.com; qxbsdnd@163.com; wangjun.cau@foxmail.com; wjhdg@163.com; lanlang524@126.com; qmqin@pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,,19,20,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2015,7,8,,,,,10562,10588,,10.3390/rs70810562,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs70810562,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000360818800049,View Full Record in Web of Science

Open areas affected by flooding have low backscatter due to the specular reflection of calm water surfaces. Floodwater within built-up areas leads to double-bounce effects, the complexity of which depends on the configuration of floodwater concerning the facades of the surrounding buildings. Hence, it has been shown that the analysis of interferometric SAR coherence reduces the underdetection of floods in urbanized areas. Moreover, the high potential of deep convolutional neural networks for advancing SAR-based flood mapping is widely acknowledged. Therefore, we introduce an urban-aware U-Net model using dual-polarization Sentinel-1 multitemporal intensity and coherence data to map the extent of flooding in urban environments. It uses a priori information (i.e., an SAR-derived probabilistic urban mask) in the proposed urban-aware module, consisting of channel-wise attention and urban-aware normalization submodules to calibrate features and improve the final predictions. In this study, Sentinel-1 single-look complex data acquired over four study sites from three continents have been considered. The qualitative evaluation and quantitative analysis have been carried out using six urban flood cases. A comparison with previous methods reveals a significant enhancement in the accuracy of urban flood mapping: the F1 score of flooded urban increased from 0.3 to 0.6 with few false alarms in urban area using our method.

To improve the accuracy of architectural style classification, we propose an architectural style classification method based on CNN and channel-spatial attention. Firstly, we add a preprocessing operation before CNN feature extraction to select main building candidate region in architectural image and then use CNN feature extractor for deep feature extraction. Secondly, channel-spatial attention module is introduced to generate an attention map, which can not only enhance the texture feature representation of architectural images but also focus on the spatial features of different architectural elements.

The majority of contributions aimed at identifying debris and rubble piles, as the main focus is to assess collapsed and partially collapsed structures. However, these approaches might not be optimal for the image classification of facade damages, where damages might appear in the form of spalling, cracks and collapse of small segments of the facade. A few studies focused their damage detection on the facades using only post-event images. Nonetheless, several studies achieved better performances in damage detection approaches when considering multi-temporal image data. Hence, in this work a multi-temporal facade damage detection is tested. The first objective is to optimally merge pre- and post-event aerial oblique imagery within a supervised classification approach using convolutional neural networks to detect facade damages. The second objective is related to the fact that facades are normally depicted in several views in aerial manned photogrammetric surveys; hence, different procedures combining these multi-view image data are also proposed and embedded in the image classification approach. Six multi-temporal approaches are compared against 3 mono-temporal ones. The results indicate the superiority of multi-temporal approaches (up to similar to 25% in f1-score) when compared to the mono-temporal ones. The best performing multi-temporal approach takes as input sextuples (3 views per epoch, per facade) within a late fusion approach to perform the image classification of facade damages. However, the detection of small damages, such as smaller cracks or smaller areas of spalling, remains challenging in this approach, mainly due to the low resolution (similar to 0.14 m ground sampling distance) of the dataset used.","[Duarte, Diogo; Nex, Francesco; Kerle, Norman; Vosselman, George] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, Enschede, Netherlands; [Duarte, Diogo] Univ Coimbra, Dept Math, Coimbra, Portugal; [Duarte, Diogo] Univ Coimbra, Inst Syst Engn & Comp Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal",University of Twente; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade de Coimbra,"Duarte, D (corresponding author), Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, Enschede, Netherlands.;Duarte, D (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Dept Math, Coimbra, Portugal.;Duarte, D (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Inst Syst Engn & Comp Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal.",d.duarte@utwente.nl,,,,,,,,10,10,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 3,2020,57,5,,,,,670,686,,10.1080/15481603.2020.1768768,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2020.1768768,,MAY 2020,,"Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000540114900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Procedural modeling has become popular in recent years to overcome this issue, but creating a grammar to get a desired output is difficult and time consuming even for expert users. In this paper, we present an interactive tool that allows users to automatically generate such a grammar from a single image of a building. The user selects a photograph and highlights the silhouette of the target building as input to our method. Our pipeline automatically generates the building components, from large-scale building mass to fine-scale windows and doors geometry. Each stage of our pipeline combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and optimization to select and parameterize procedural grammars that reproduce the building elements of the picture. In the first stage, our method jointly estimates camera parameters and building mass shape. Once known, the building mass enables the rectification of the facades, which are given as input to the second stage that recovers the facade layout. This layout allows us to extract individual windows and doors that are subsequently fed to the last stage of the pipeline that selects procedural grammars for windows and doors. Finally, the grammars are combined to generate a complete procedural building as output. We devise a common methodology to make each stage of this pipeline tractable.

Firstly, symmetry information is detected from the image using SIFT algorithm for image analysis. Next, the symmetry information will be removed from the facade image. Finally, get the SIFT feature of widows and doors.

However, deep learning models commonly need abundant labeled data for training, and it could be impractical and expensive to collect sufficient labeled samples for all classes of defects. Sometimes, there are only a few samples in rare classes, which are not able to support the training process. In addition, common classifiers based on deep learning cannot easily extend their recognition classes and thus cannot classify unseen classes with only a few samples. Therefore, to overcome the problem of insufficient data and the extension constraint of the classifier, a few-shot classification method based on an extensible classifier and contrastive learning is proposed to recognize unseen classes with limited (1, 2 or 5) samples. The extensible classifier implemented by imprinting weights can easily extend the model to classify unseen classes with a few samples. Meanwhile, contrastive learning, which is a complementary task in training, is used to enrich the model's generalization and representation on unseen classes. Besides, a hard negative mining (HNM) method is introduced to address the imbalanced data in contrastive learning and further improve accuracies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the few-shot classification accuracy with only 1 sample from 35.8% to 63.5% on novel and unseen classes, and from 73.1% to 82.1% on all classes, while maintaining a high and comparable accuracy (89.6%) on base classes.","[Cui, Zhiyan; Lu, Na] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Syst Engn Inst, Sch Automat Sci & Engn, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Cui, Zhiyan] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Built Environm, Singapore 117566, Singapore; [Wang, Qian] Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct & Real Estate, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University; National University of Singapore; Southeast University - China,"Lu, N (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Syst Engn Inst, Sch Automat Sci & Engn, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Wang, Q (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct & Real Estate, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China.",bdgwang@nus.edu.sg; lvna2009@mail.xjtu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2022,141,,,,,,,,104381,10.1016/j.autcon.2022.104381,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2022.104381,,JUN 2022,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000812885900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this context, a promising construction technique is represented by ventilated facades (VFs). This paper aims to propose three different VFs and the authors define a novel machine learning-based approach to evaluate and predict their energy performance under different boundary conditions, without the need for expensive on-site experimentations Design/methodology/approach The approach is based on the use of machine learning algorithms for the evaluation of different VF configurations and allows for the prediction of the temperatures in the cavities and of the heat fluxes. The authors trained different regression algorithms and obtained low prediction errors, in particular for temperatures. The authors used such models to simulate the thermo-physical behavior of the VFs and determined the most energy-efficient design variant. Findings The authors found that regression trees allow for an accurate simulation of the thermal behavior of VFs. The authors also studied feature weights to determine the most relevant thermo-physical parameters. Finally, the authors determined the best design variant and the optimal air velocity in the cavity. Originality/value This study is unique in four main aspects: the thermo-dynamic analysis is performed under different thermal masses, positions of the cavity and geometries; the VFs are mated with a controlled ventilation system, used to parameterize the thermodynamic behavior under stepwise variations of the air inflow; temperatures and heat fluxes are predicted through machine learning models; the best configuration is determined through simulations, with no onerous in situ experimentations needed.","[Summa, Serena; Ulpiani, Giulia; Di Perna, Costanzo] Univ Politecn Marche, Fac Ingn, Dept Ind Engn & Math Sci, Ancona, Italy; [Mircoli, Alex; Potena, Domenico; Diamantini, Claudia] Univ Politecn Marche, Fac Ingn, Dept Informat Engn, Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University; Marche Polytechnic University,"Mircoli, A (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Marche, Fac Ingn, Dept Informat Engn, Ancona, Italy.",s.summa@pm.univpm.it; a.mircoli@univpm.it; d.potena@univpm.it; giuliaulpiani@gmail.com; c.diamantini@univpm.it; c.diperna@univpm.it,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,2022 JUN 22,2022,,,,,,,,,,10.1108/CI-11-2021-0229,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/CI-11-2021-0229,,JUN 2022,,Construction & Building Technology,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000813410600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study is limited to the Swedish multifamily building stock constructed between 1945 and 1975, as these buildings are facing refurbishment needs that advantageously can be combined with energy retrofitting. In total, 514 ocular observations were conducted in Google Street View of two building characteristics that were needed to determine the feasibility of the chosen energy retrofitting packages: (i) building type and (ii) suitability for additional facade insulation. Results showed that these building characteristics could be predicted with an accuracy of 88.9% and 72.5% respectively.

The template used in the miniature solid-shaping strategy guides the photosensitive materials patterning into 3D circular configuration, which divides the space into equal subdivisions.

Advertising and information signs on building facades are one of the types of outdoor advertising. As a rule, there are laws and design codes in cities that define permissible look of such signs. At the same time, in metropolises, there is a problem of timely detection of advertising constructions on facades that violate these rules. City-scale monitoring of facade conditions is beyond the capabilities of any city's authorities. To address this issue, we propose a solution which combines street-view maps and machine learning to automate the process of searching for law-breaking advertising objects on building facades. We develop a dataset for a machine learning model and a set of checks for detected advertising objects to check their legality.

In order to evaluate the ventilation performance in a residential building, an impact factor was determined for these measured datasets. This study selected two residential apartments in Switzerland and measured indoor carbon dioxide concentration and volatile organic compound levels, facade opening ratio, mechanical ventilation rates, and indoor temperature and humidity ratio between July 2019 and June 2020. The results described that ANN models illustrate performance in predicting ventilation performance and indoor air quality using mechanical and natural ventilation systems in a residential apartment. Both algorithms have presented relatively lower average error rates, 3.36- 6.12 % in the analysis results. The results presented that the two ANN models using the Levenberg-Marquardt Back Propagation (LMBP) algorithm have good agreements with actual data measured. The accuracy differences were 0.18-1.89 for the average error rates, 0.13-0.78 for the Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Square Error (CVRMSE) and 0.07-0.35 for the Normalized Mean Bias Error (NMBE). Through impact factor analysis, mechanical ventilation system mainly dominates the impact of indoor ventilation performance, and other surrounding environments also had significantly affected the resi-dential building. However, the natural ventilation system has limitations to largely influence the ventilation performance in the building because occupants have difficulties adjusting ventilation rates in extreme weather conditions or early morning and nighttime. And these elements could not affect indoor air quality independently. These ANN methods are helpful in analyzing input parameters how each element factor can influence indoor air quality in a residential building. The proposed ANN methods can utilize to predict the performance as reliable approaches.","[Kim, Moon Keun] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Energy Technol, N-0130 Oslo, Norway; [Cremers, Bart] Zehnder Grp Zwolle BV, Lingen str 2, NL-8028 PM Zwolle, Netherlands; [Liu, Jiying] Shandong Jianzhu Univ, Sch Thermal Engn, Jinan 250101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jianhua] Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Comp Sci, N-0130 Oslo, Norway; [Wang, Junqi] Southeast Univ, Sch Architecture, 2 Sipailou, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China; [Wang, Junqi] Suzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Jiangsu Key Lab Intelligent Bldg Energy Efficiency, Suzhou 215009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet); Shandong Jianzhu University; Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet); Southeast University - China; Suzhou University of Science & Technology,"Kim, MK (corresponding author), Oslo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Energy Technol, N-0130 Oslo, Norway.",,,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2022,83,,,,,,,,103981,10.1016/j.scs.2022.103981,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2022.103981,,JUN 2022,,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000822702000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is demonstrated how the dimensionality reduction method isomap can be applied to calculate non-linear street-manifolds where each point on the manifold corresponds to a house facade. Through interpolation between manifold points and the application of an inverse Hough transform, basic structure plans for new house facades are obtained. If the interpolated points are close to the manifold it can be argued that the new plans reflect the character of the surrounding streetscape.

In the particular cases of building-integrated and building-attached photovoltaic systems (BIPV and BAPV, respectively) the time-varying partial shading conditions are a relevant added difficulty for modeling the PV power conversion. The availability of laser imaging detection and ranging (LIDAR) data to create very-high-resolution elevation digital models can be effectively used for computing the shading at high resolution. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) has been used to model the power generation of different BIPV arrays on a 5 min basis using the meteorological and solar irradiance on-site conditions, as well as the shading patterns estimated from a digital surface model as inputs. The ANN model has been validated using three years of 5-min-basis monitored data showing very high accuracy (6-16% of relative error depending on the facade). The proposed methodology combines the shading computation from a digital surface model with powerful machine learning algorithms for modeling vertical PV arrays under partial shading conditions. The results presented here prove also the capability of the machine learning techniques towards the creation of a digital twin for the specific case of BIPV systems that complements the conventional monitoring strategies and can be used in the diagnosis of performance anomalies.","[Polo, Jesus; Martin-Chivelet, Nuria; Sanz-Saiz, Carlos] CIEMAT, Renewable Energy Div, Photovolta Solar Energy Unit, Avda Complutense 40, Madrid 28040, Spain","Centro de Investigaciones Energeticas, Medioambientales Tecnologicas","Polo, J (corresponding author), CIEMAT, Renewable Energy Div, Photovolta Solar Energy Unit, Avda Complutense 40, Madrid 28040, Spain.",jesus.polo@ciemat.es; nuria.martin@ciemat.es; carlos.sanz@ciemat.es,,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2022,15,11,,,,,,,4173,10.3390/en15114173,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15114173,,,,Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000808898300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

One of the challenges relates to the power balance at the power transformers, which might not have sufficient spare capacity to accommodate the solar electricity feed in. In this work, we estimate the power balance at the transformers in a small urban area of Lisbon, Portugal, considering full deployment of PV, installed on rooftops and building facades. The PV potential is estimated through two different approaches: the simplified Peak power method, which considers the typical peak power of a module and the available area, and the more labour-intensive Irradiance method that accounts for hourly time step solar irradiance and demand data or simulations. The main findings of this work point out that the Peak power method has limited success if PV facades are to be considered. Moreover, a high PV penetration scenario leads to a locally less resilient grid, hence a solar PV factor was proposed to account for future deployment of PV systems in urban environments.

It leads to further problems such as biological growth, delamination and efflorescence. Increased moisture also affects users' indoor comfort and more energy is needed for heating due to higher thermal conductivity. Therefore, it is useful to detect it before visible signs occur and this is possible with infrared thermography. A quasi-quantitative approach based on time-dependent infrared thermographic inspection and thermogram analysis by quantitative methods was tested in an adhered ceramic facade where rising damp had already been identified. Simple image subtraction (SIS), nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and principal component analysis (PCA) were the quantitative methods tested for the analysis of thermograms. Hammer-tapping control and surface moisture measurements were the auxiliary techniques used to assess the results. Comparative assessments showed that the quasi-quantitative approach using PCA has great potential to detect changes in moisture and also to eliminate false indications caused by unavoidable reflection and shading. The results obtained by SIS and NMF on the other hand, had limited performance in showing areas with high moisture content. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The index captures pedestrians' willingness to deviate from their shortest path and provides a measure of the scenic and experience value provided by different parts of the city. We then use computer vision techniques combined with georeferenced data to measure the built environment of streets. We show that desirable streets have better access to public amenities such as parks, sidewalks, and urban furniture. They are also sinuous, visually enclosed, have less complex facades, and have more diverse business establishments.

While this problem has been extensively studied, most approaches are geared towards indoor scenes and often rely on multiple modalities (depth, multiple views) for accurate estimation of normal maps. Outdoor scenes pose a greater challenge as they exhibit significant lighting variation, often contain occluders, and structures like building facades are often ridden with numerous windows and protrusions. Conventional supervised learning schemes excel in indoor scenes, but do not exhibit competitive performance when trained and deployed in outdoor environments. Furthermore, they involve complex network architectures and require many more trainable parameters. To tackle these challenges, we present an adversarial learning scheme that regularizes the output normal maps from a neural network to appear more realistic, by using a small number of precisely annotated examples. Our method presents a lightweight and simpler architecture, while improving performance by at least 1.5x across most metrics.

Our approach combines structure from motion (SfM) with deep-learning-based segmentation techniques. Given multiple-view images of a building, we compute a three-dimensional (3D) planar abstraction (LOD2 model) of its point cloud using SfM techniques. To obtain LOD3 models, we use deep learning to perform semantic segmentation of the openings in the two-dimensional (2D) images. Unlike existing approaches, we do not rely on complex input, pre-defined 3D shapes or manual intervention. To demonstrate the robustness of our method, we show that it can generate 3D building shapes from a collection of building images with no further input. For evaluating reconstructions, we also propose two novel metrics. The first is a Euclidean-distance-based correlation of the 3D building model with the point cloud. The second involves re-projecting 3D model facades onto source photos to determine dice scores with respect to the ground-truth masks.

The high investment cost of these systems makes mandatory an appropriate control in order to maximize the energy benefits during its operation. Within this context artificial intelligence techniques have been successfully used to control active thermal energy storage units. This paper uses an experimentally validated numerical tool to study the effect of different control strategies on the performance of one TES system applied to the building sector, a ventilated facade with PCM which uses free cooling. Three different strategies were designed to control the ventilated facade based on cost savings, energy reduction and CO2 mitigation, under different climatic conditions. Results show robust benefits in the three tested control strategies, achieving average savings in comparison to a manual operation of the system of 4.3%, 7.8%, and 16.7%.

Often, images of buildings are the only input for texturing 3D models, and these images may be occluded by vegetation. One task of image inpainting is to remove these clutter objects. Since the disturbing objects can also be of a larger scale, modern deep learning techniques should be applied to replace them as realistically and context-aware as possible. To support an inpainting network, it is useful to include a-priori information. An example of a network that considers edge images is the two-stage GAN model denoted as EdgeConnect. This idea is taken up in this work and further developed to a three-stage GAN (3GAN) model for facade images by additionally incorporating semantic label images. By inpainting the label images, not only a clear geometric structure but also class information, like position and shape of windows and their typical color distribution, are provided to the model. This model is compared qualitatively and quantitatively with the conventional version of EdgeConnect and another well-known deep-learning-based approach on inpainting which is based on partial convolutions. This latter approach was outperformed by both GAN-based methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively. While the quantitative evaluation showed that the conventional EdgeConnect method performs minimally best, the proposed method yields a slightly better representation of specific facade elements.","[Kottler, Benedikt; List, Ludwig; Bulatov, Dimitri] Fraunhofer Inst Optron Syst Technol & Image Explo, Gutleuthausstr 1, D-76275 Ettlingen, Germany; [Weinmann, Martin] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Englerstr 7, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany","Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Fraunhofer Optronics, System Technologies & Image Exploitation Ettlingen; Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology","Kottler, B (corresponding author), Fraunhofer Inst Optron Syst Technol & Image Explo, Gutleuthausstr 1, D-76275 Ettlingen, Germany.",,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,,2022,,,,,,,427,435,,10.5220/0010830600003124,http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0010830600003124,,,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000777569400044,View Full Record in Web of Science

It benefits from an extensive prior knowledge of probability density distributions and functional dependencies and allows for the incorporation of further structural characteristics such as symmetries. Bayesian networks are used to determine posterior beliefs. Stochastic reasoning is complex since the problem is characterized by a mixture of discrete and continuous parameters that are in turn correlated by nonlinear constraints. To cope with this kind of complexity, the implemented reasoner combines statistical methods with constraint propagation.

In this paper we present an approach to seismic building damage assessment, where a graph-based learning technique is employed to detect and to classify building damage levels, given instances of four object classes derived by supervised classification in object space.

Due to the fact that these environments can grow even more over time, applications related to their monitoring tend to turn to autonomous intelligent systems, which together with remote sensing data could help or even predict daily life situations. The task of mapping cities by autonomous operators was usually carried out by aerial optical images due to its scale and resolution; however new scientific questions have arisen, and this has led research into a new era of highly-detailed data extraction. For many years, using artificial neural models to solve complex problems such as automatic image classification was commonplace, owing much of their popularity to their ability to adapt to complex situations without needing human intervention. In spite of that, their popularity declined in the mid-2000s, mostly due to the complex and time-consuming nature of their methods and workflows. However, newer neural network architectures have brought back the interest in their application for autonomous classifiers, especially for image classification purposes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been a trend for pixel-wise image segmentation, showing flexibility when detecting and classifying any kind of object, even in situations where humans failed to perceive differences, such as in city scenarios. In this paper, we aim to explore and experiment with state-of-the-art technologies to semantically label 3D urban models over complex scenarios. To achieve these goals, we split the problem into two main processing lines: first, how to correctly label the facade features in the 2D domain, where a supervised CNN is used to segment ground-based facade images into six feature classes, roof, window, wall, door, balcony and shop; second, a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) workflow is used to extract the geometry of the facade, wherein the segmented images in the previous stage are then used to label the generated mesh by a reverse ray-tracing technique. This paper demonstrates that the proposed methodology is robust in complex scenarios. The facade feature inferences have reached up to 93% accuracy over most of the datasets used. Although it still presents some deficiencies in unknown architectural styles and needs some improvements to be made regarding 3D-labeling, we present a consistent and simple methodology to handle the problem.","[Lotte, Rodolfo Georjute; de Aragao, Luiz Eduardo Oliveira e Cruz; Shimabukuro, Yosio Edemir] Natl Inst Space Res, Remote Sensing Div, Av Astronautas 1758, BR-12227010 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil; [Haala, Norbert] Univ Stuttgart, IfP, Geschwister Scholl Str 24D, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany; [Karpina, Mateusz] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Geodesy & Geoinformat, Norwida 25, PL-50375 Wroclaw, Poland; [de Aragao, Luiz Eduardo Oliveira e Cruz] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter EX4 4RJ, Devon, England",Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE); University of Stuttgart; Institute of Geodesy & Cartography; Wroclaw University of Environmental & Life Sciences; University of Exeter,"Lotte, RG (corresponding author), Natl Inst Space Res, Remote Sensing Div, Av Astronautas 1758, BR-12227010 Sao Jose Dos Campos, SP, Brazil.",lotte@dsr.inpe.br; norbert.haala@ifp.uni-stuttgart.de; mateusz.karpina@igig.up.wroc.pl; laragao@dsr.inpe.br; yosio@dsr.inpe.br,,,,,,,,13,13,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2018,10,9,,,,,,,1435,10.3390/rs10091435,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10091435,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000449993800115,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically, a UNet-based semantic segmentation model, FSA-UNet (Fusion-Self-Attention-UNet) is proposed to integrate remote sensing and street view features and the vulnerability information contained in the images is fully exploited.

As the most commonly adopted data source, remote sensing imagery can only reflect the damage situation on top of a building and fails to present the damage level from the perspective of the human eye. Recently, an increasing number of Google Street View (GSV) images provide the chance to understand the human's perception of damage on the ground. However, to automatically and quantitatively apply GSV images in damage assessment, two research questions need to be answered: (1) Can deep learning be successfully applied to automate the process of evaluating postdisaster damage using GSV images? (2) Does damage assessment using GSV images provide a different insight, compared with existing approaches, such as remote sensing imagery? Based on our experiments using GSV images and remote sensing imagery in Mexico Beach, FL after Hurricane Michael, we present two conclusions: (1) By applying a deep learning model, the GSV-based damage assessment can be satisfactorily and automatically conducted, with an accuracy of approximately 70% for a single GSV image. (2) GSV images provide a different insight into damage assessment since remote sensing imagery cannot record the damage to exterior walls, windows, doors and facades. When the overall damage level is relatively low, GSV images show better performance in damage assessment. Conversely, when the overall damage level is relatively high, remote sensing imagery shows better performance based our experiments.","[Zhai, Wei; Peng, Zhong-Ren] Univ Florida, Sch Landscape Architecture & Planning, Coll Design Construct & Planning, Int Ctr Adaptat & Design IAdapt, Arch Bldg,POB 115706, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Zhai, Wei] Univ Florida, Herbert Wertheim Coll Engn, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Peng, ZR (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Sch Landscape Architecture & Planning, Coll Design Construct & Planning, Int Ctr Adaptat & Design IAdapt, Arch Bldg,POB 115706, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",wei.zhai@ufl.edu; zpeng@ufl.edu,,,,,,,,21,24,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2020,123,,,,,,,,102252,10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102252,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102252,,,,Geography,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000581742200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Additionally, common building control systems are typically based on simple decision-making tools, which possess the ability to obtain controllable parameters for indoor temperatures. Nevertheless, the accuracy of such common building control systems is improvable with the integration of advanced decision-making techniques embedded into software and energy management tools. This paper presents the design of a building energy management system (BEMS), which is currently under development, and that makes use of artificial intelligence for the automated decision-making process required for optimal comfort of occupants and utilization of renewables for achieving energy-efficiency in buildings. The research falls under the scope of the H2020 project BREASER which implements fuzzy logic with the aim of governing the energy resources of a school in Turkey, which has been renovated with a ventilated facade with integrated renewable energy sources (RES). The BRESAER BEMS includes prediction techniques that increase the accuracy of common BEMS tools, and subsequent energy savings, while ensuring the indoor thermal comfort of the building occupants. In particular, weather forecast and simulation strategies are integrated into the functionalities of the overall system.

Self-sufficient high-rise buildings, which integrate (electricity) generation and efficient usage of resources with dense habitation, can be a sustainable solution for future urbanisation. This paper focuses on transforming Europoint Towers in Rotterdam into self-sufficient buildings considering energy consumption and food production (lettuce crops) using artificial intelligence. Design parameters consist of the number of farming floors, shape, and the properties of the proposed facade skin that includes shading devices. Nine thousand samples are collected from various floor levels to predict self-sufficiency criteria using artificial neural networks (ANN). Optimisation problems with 117 decision variables are formulated using 45 ANN models that have very high prediction accuracies. 13 optimisation algorithms are used for an in-detail investigation of self-sufficiency at the building scale, and potential sufficiency at the neighbourhood scale. Results indicate that 100% and 43.7% self-sufficiencies could be reached for lettuce crops and electricity, respectively, for three buildings with 1800 residents. At the neighbourhood scale, lettuce production could be sufficient for 27,000 people with a decrease of self-sufficiency in terms of energy use of up to 11.6%. Consequently, this paper discusses the potentials and the improvements for self-sufficient high-rise buildings.","[Ekici, Berk; Turrin, Michela; Sariyildiz, Ikbal Sevil] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Chair Design Informat, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands; [Turkcan, Okan F.

This type of tilework, the so-called haft rang, technically comprises of forming a clay body and firing two glazed layers on top of the body. In the present paper, the first analytical data concerning haft rang tiles is provided. To do so, forty three samples of Safavid haft rang bodies were analysed by wavelength dispersive x-ray fluorescence (WDXRF) and the obtained data were handled by principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that the 17th century haft rang tiles wherever found are local products; that is, Safavid tile-makers have used local clay sources to make the bodies of haft rang tiles. The analytical data also showed that old tileworks, in general sense, can be simply replaced by newly manufactured tiles or, at least, all tilework revetments in an individual edifice might not have been produced in an identical workshop. Moreover, WDXRF was used as an accurate and precise method to determine the chemical composition and to support compositional classification in provenance studies and can be considered as a reliable alternative for studying the provenance of archaeological ceramics.

A reliable and simplified macro approach called Multi Pier (MP) method was employed to analyze single masonry piers with different aspect ratios (h/l). The shear and flexural strength along with the failure mechanism of each pier were obtained versus various levels of axial force during the sensitivity analysis. The results of the analysis were used as an input of a machine learning approach called Back Propagation Multi-Layer Perceptron (BPMLP) to generalize the data. The outcomes of machine learning was utilized to develop simple, but accurate equations as well as a user-friendly application to obtain the shear strength of a masonry pier according to the mechanical and geometrical properties. The BPMLP network is also able to produce and estimate all potential failure modes of a masonry wall. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed equations and developed application was evaluated using a novel macro-element approach. It is concluded that the proposed equations can be used in any macro-elements approach to enhancing efficiency and saving time. The proposed Equivalent Wall (EW) model was able to precisely estimate the response of full-scale facade masonry walls subjected to the in-plane loads. According to this model, each pier and spandrel was substituted by two elastic continuous (2D) macro-elements which connected via two bi-component discrete el-ements. A linear behavior based on masonry modulus of elasticity and bi-linear constitution according to the shear strength was assigned to the axial and shears components of the discrete links, respectively. The proposed EW model was verified using a five-story-seven-bay masonry wall. Satisfactory results were observed in terms of global load-deflection behavior comparing with popular approaches from the literature.","[Li, Hongbo; Li, Jing] Wuchang Univ Technol, Sch Intelligent Construction, Wuhan 430223, Peoples R China; [Li, Hongbo] CCCC Third Harbor Constructions Co Ltd, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Farhangi, Visar] No Arizona Univ, Dept Civil Engn Construction Management & Environm, Flagstaff, AZ USA",Wuchang University of Technology; Northern Arizona University,"Li, HB (corresponding author), Wuchang Univ Technol, Sch Intelligent Construction, Wuhan 430223, Peoples R China.;Li, HB (corresponding author), CCCC Third Harbor Constructions Co Ltd, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.",lhb20211005@126.com; visar.farhangi@nau.edu,,,,,,,,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2023,49,,,,,,443,466,,10.1016/j.istruc.2023.01.095,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.istruc.2023.01.095,,FEB 2023,,"Engineering, Civil",,,,,,Y,N,2024-01-16,WOS:000931068200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We propose a novel approach which incorporates prior knowledge (i.e., a 3D city model of the environment) and improves the trajectory. The recorded point cloud is matched with the semantic city model using a point-to-plane iterative closest point method. A pre-classification step enables an informed sampling of appropriate matching points. Random forest is used as classifier to discriminate between facade and remaining points. Local inconsistencies are tackled by a segmentwise partitioning of the point cloud where an interpolation guarantees a seamless transition between the segments.

However, there is currently a gap in existing literature regarding the use of visual labels contained in street-level imagery, where their value as indicators of POI categories is assessed. This paper presents Scene-Text Semantics (ST-Sem), a novel method that leverages visual labels (e.g., texts, logos) from street-level imagery as complementary information for the categorization of business-related POIs. Contrary to existing methods that fuse visual and textual information at a feature-level, we propose a late fusion approach that combines visual and textual cues after resolving issues of incorrect digitization and semantic ambiguity of the retrieved textual components.

Exposure estimation, though, may be tricky, especially in urban areas, where large-scale surveying is generally expensive and impractical; yet, it is in urban areas that most assets are at stake when a disaster strikes. Authoritative sources such as cadastral data and business records may not be readily accessible to private stakeholders such as insurance companies; airborne and especially satellite-based Earth-Observation data obviously cannot retrieve all relevant pieces of information. Recently, a growing interest is recorded in the exploitation of street-level pictures, procured either through crowdsourcing or through specialized services like Google Street View. Pictures of building facades convey a great amount of information, but their interpretation is complex. Recently, however, smarter image analysis methods based on deep learning started appearing in literature, made possible by the increasing availability of computational power. In this paper, we leverage such methods to design a system for large-scale, systematic scanning of street-level pictures intended to map floor numbers in urban buildings. Although quite simple, this piece of information is a relevant exposure proxy in risk assessment. In the proposed system, a series of georeferenced images are automatically retrieved from the repository where they sit. A tailored deep learning net is first trained on sample images tagged through visual interpretation, and then systematically applied to the entire retrieved dataset. A specific algorithm allows attaching number of floors tags to the correct building in a dedicated GIS (Geographic Information System) layer, which is finally output by the system as an exposure proxy layer.","[Iannelli, Gianni Cristian; Dell'Acqua, Fabio] Ticinum Aerosp Srl, R&D Sect, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Dell'Acqua, Fabio] Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Ingn Ind & Informaz, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",University of Pavia,"Iannelli, GC; Dell'Acqua, F (corresponding author), Ticinum Aerosp Srl, R&D Sect, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.;Dell'Acqua, F (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Ingn Ind & Informaz, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",gc.iannelli@ticinumaerospace.com; fabio.dellacqua@unipv.it,,,,,,,,18,20,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2017,1,2,,,,,,,16,10.3390/urbansci1020016,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/urbansci1020016,,,,Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Geography; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000621190400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While pixelwise classification is a suitable approach to achieve this goal, state-of-the-art kernel methods are generally not applicable since training and testing phase involve large amounts of data. We address this problem by presenting a method for large-scale inference with Gaussian processes. Standard limitations of Gaussian process classifiers in terms of speed and memory are overcome by pre-clustering the data using decision trees. This leads to a breakdown of the entire problem into several independent classification tasks whose complexity is controlled by the maximum number of training examples allowed in the tree leaves. We additionally propose a technique which allows for computing multi-class probabilities by incorporating uncertainties of the classifier estimates. The approach provides pixelwise semantics for a wide range of applications and different image types such as those from scene understanding, defect localization, and remote sensing. Our experiments are performed with a facade recognition application that shows the significant performance gain achieved by our method compared to previous approaches.","[Froehlich, Bjoern; Rodner, Erik; Kemmler, Michael; Denzler, Joachim] Univ Jena, Jena, Germany; [Rodner, Erik] Univ Calif Berkeley, ICSI, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Fröhlich, B (corresponding author), Univ Jena, Jena, Germany.",bjoern.froehlich@uni-jena.de,,,,,,,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2013,24,5,,,,,1043,1053,,10.1007/s00138-012-0480-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00138-012-0480-y,,,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Cybernetics; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000320512000013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Scanner orientation is partially known through the inclination sensors of the laser scanner used. Knowing these values allows us to reduce the point cloud data into a profile distribution function. After orientation, this distribution is a series of peaks and valleys suitable for segmentation. Each segmented layer is afterwards processed to find the facade contours. The results obtained prove that the approach may be successfully employed in building segmentation and extraction of planar features.

This identification facilitates the annotation of any visual object to a building's facade and is an essential step in a variety of applications, such as automatic target detection in surveillance, real-time robot localization and visual navigation, architectural design, and 3D city reconstruction. Because of its importance, a significant number of building recognition systems have been proposed in recent years. Nevertheless, there is no systematic survey of building recognition in urban environments yet. To this end, we present a comprehensive review of the dominant building recognition systems by first grouping them into two categories: (i) effectiveness approaches that mainly focus on the improvement of recognition performance and (ii) efficiency methods that attempt to enhance the recognition speed. Effectiveness approaches are further categorized into two different groups: (i) feature representation-based algorithms and (ii) wide baseline matching-based methods. Efficiency methods are divided into: (i) dimensionality reduction-based methods and (ii) clustering-based algorithms. We provide analysis and discussions on each type of method and summarize their, advantages and weaknesses in depth. Furthermore, we outline future research directions and associated challenges in this promising area.

Therefore, a data fusion of given 3d models and recorded ER image sequences is performed. A relative orientation of the images of the sequence is generated using Nister's five-point algorithm and image triplets. This results in a point cloud of correspondence points and a relative camera path. The relative oriented image scene is then matched in two steps first to the recoded GPS camera path and then to the given building with least squares minimum distance. Textures are extracted for every image and its according camera position from all visible surfaces. Because one image does not show complete building facades, the extracted textures of the images are combined to create complete textures for the model surfaces. These textures can be used for feature extraction and object recognition for analyzing buildings and assigned 3d coordinates to found features and objects.","[Hoegner, Ludwig; Stilla, Uwe] Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Hoegner, L (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, Munich, Germany.",Ludwig.Hoegner@bv.tum.de; Stilla@tum.de,,,,,,,,6,7,,,,,,,,,,,,2009,,,,,,,1263,1268,,,,,,,Remote Sensing,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000270972300215,View Full Record in Web of Science

Commonly, facades are designed to fulfill a multitude of objectives such as superior aesthetic appearance, a higher degree of weathering reliability, quick installation, high transparency as well as economic and ecologic efficiency. For such glazing applications, often an assessment of acoustic properties and especially sound insulation abilities are required. Because of the complexity of such an experimental or computational investigation given the framing systems and glass unit compositions, a reliable and fairly accurate estimation of sound insulation properties of such systems becomes time-consuming and demanding. This paper provides a Machine Learning (ML) based estimation tool of acoustic properties (weighted sound insulation value RW, STC and OITC) of different glazing set-ups. A sufficiently rich database was used to train several machine learning algorithms. The acoustic properties are determined by comparing the third-octave or octave band spectrum of the sound reduction index with a reference curve (typical curve for solid construction elements) specified in the standard DIN EN ISO 717-1. Sound insulation values can currently only be determined by complex and expensive experimental investigations or numerical simulations for certain glass set-ups. Hence, there is no efficient tool for convenient and reliable estimation of the sound insulation performance of glazing systems available at the moment. To this end, the engineering team led by the authors conducted extensive studies on various glazings consisting of different glass assemblies with varying glass, cavity and interlayer thicknesses and different types of interlayer and gas fillings. Based on our research outcomes, a comprehensive web-based prediction program, the so-called AI Tool, has been developed recently. This program can provide a quick analysis and accurate prediction of arbitrary glazing set-ups, interlayers and glazing infills. A series of laboratory tests were conducted to validate the predictions by the AI Tool. The goal of this program is to provide designers, engineers, and architects an effective and economically efficient tool to facilitate the design w.r.t. acoustical properties.","[Drass, Michael; Kraus, Michael Anton; Riedel, Henrik] M&M Network Ing UG Haftungsbeschrankt, Lennebergstr 40, D-55124 Mainz, Germany; [Stelzer, Ingo] Kuraray Europe GmbH, Philipp Reis Str 4, D-65795 Hattersheim, Germany",,"Drass, M (corresponding author), M&M Network Ing UG Haftungsbeschrankt, Lennebergstr 40, D-55124 Mainz, Germany.",drass@mm-network-ing.com; kraus@mm-network-ing.com; Ingo.Stelzer@kuraray.com,,,,,,,,2,4,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2022,7,1,,,,,101,118,,10.1007/s40940-022-00167-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40940-022-00167-z,,FEB 2022,,Construction & Building Technology,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000749448300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The increase of the proportion of glazed building facades is an incomplete solution raising other problems regarding thermal and visual comfort, while rebound effects in terms of lighting usage lowered the energetic benefits of LED technology. Another strategy to address the issue of energy is the well-known strategy of the re-introduction of task lights. The current study presents a system arbitrating the contribution of daylight with general and task electric lighting from the prediction of key performance indicators (work plane illuminance and daylight glare probability) by a machine learning model. It aims at reducing energy consumption while minimizing the impact on occupants' comfort and productivity. This system was validated by the mean of a controlled user experiment with 60 participants. Altogether, our data revealed that RADIANCE simulations model accurately predicts on-site monitoring (R2 = .96) and that the machine learning model accurately predicts RADIANCE simulations for both work plane illuminance (R2 = .99) and daylight glare probability (R2 = .99) allowing to operate the automated system. Data from the user experiment shows that our system successfully saves 35 Wh on average compared to manual operation of the room by users, by making prior use of daylight and task lighting. This represents more than halving the energy demand. Importantly, the automation impacted neither users' comfort or task performance. System acceptance constructs such as system reliability or trust in the system were found to be linked with an attribution of the locus of control to powerful others. This result suggests that the key towards high user acceptance might lie in purposefully addressing this dimension. Altogether, the presented results support the potential for energy saving through the development of user-centred lighting automation. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Significantly different attitude characteristics were found for most of the items tested. It was shown that experts are strongly influenced by corporate-normative factors and base their decisions on fewer criteria, mainly from the field of product certification. Laypersons, on the other hand, are oriented on far more aspects regarding product and manufacturer. Experience with WPC was not an issue for both groups.

While creating masks for a small number of images is possible, it rapidly becomes untenable for longer image sequences. Instead, we accomplish this step automatically using an object detection framework to explicitly recognize and remove several classes of occlusions. We propose using this technique to improve 3D urban reconstruction from street level imagery, in which building facades are frequently occluded by vegetation or vehicles. By assuming facades in the background are planar, 3D scene estimation provides important context to the inpainting process by restricting input sample patches to regions that are coplanar to the occlusion, leading to more realistic final textures. Moreover, because non-static and reflective occlusion classes tend to be difficult to reconstruct, explicitly recognizing and removing them improves the resulting 3D scene.","[Engels, Chris; Tingdahl, David; Vercruysse, Mathias; Tuytelaars, Tinne; Van Gool, Luc] Katholieke Univ Leuven, ESAT PSI IBBT, Louvain, Belgium; [Sahli, Hichem] VU Brussel, ETRO, Brussels, Belgium; [Van Gool, Luc] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, BIWI, Zurich, Switzerland",KU Leuven; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Engels, C (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, ESAT PSI IBBT, Louvain, Belgium.",,,,,,,,,2,3,,,,,,,,,,,,2011,6915,,,,,,681,692,,,,,,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000306962700061,View Full Record in Web of Science

To begin with, a camera drone with a spiral path is employed to capture building exterior images, and photogrammetry is used to conduct three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and create mesh models for the scanned building facades. High-resolution facade orthoimages are then generated from mesh models and pixelwise segmented by an artificial intelligence (AI) model named U-net. A combined data augmentation strategy, including random flipping, rotation, resizing, perspective transformation, and color adjustment, is proposed for model training with a limited number of labels. As a result, the U-net achieves an average pixel accuracy of 0.9696 and a mean intersection over union of 0.9063 in testing. Then, the developed twoStagesClustering algorithm, with a two-round shape clustering and a two-round coordinates clustering, is used to precisely extract facade elements' dimensions and coordinates from facade orthoimages and pixelwise label. In testing with the Michigan Central Station (office tower), a historic high-rise building, the developed algorithm achieves an accuracy of 99.77% in window extraction. In addition, the extracted facade geometric information and element types are transformed into AutoCAD command and script files to create CAD drawings without manual interaction. Experimental results also show that the proposed Scan4Facade method can provide clear and accurate information to assist BIM feature creation in Revit. Future research recommendations are also stated in this paper.

This paper demonstrates how the implementation of parametric design with evolutionary algorithms is considered a reliable strategy to reach optimum solutions in building performance problems. The daylight performance is investigated based on multi-objective optimization to minimize the Energy Use Intensity EUI, while maximizing Spatial Daylight Autonomy sDA and Useful Daylight Illuminance UDI. A simulation model was developed via Grasshopper, which was employed with the use of Ladybug, Honeybee, and Octopus plug-ins. The results revealed that the adaptive facade system can improve indoor daylight levels and energy performance simultaneously compared to the conventional shading system.

Cross-ratio (CR) is an invariant feature under projective transformations for collinear points. We compute the CRs of point sets in quadruplets and the CR histogram is used as the feature for retrieval purposes. Being a geometric feature, it allows us to retrieve similar images irrespective of view point and illumination changes. We can retrieve the same building even if the facade has undergone a fresh coat of paints! Color and textural features can also be included, if desired. Experimental results show a favorably very good retrieval accuracy when tested on an image database of size 4000. The method is very effective in retrieving images having man-made objects rich in polygonal structures like buildings, rail tracks, etc. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.

Physical observations and experimental research strategy were used to collect data from 383 buildings in the study area. The data were analysed using descriptive and logistic regression analyses. The results showed that 53.5% were residential buildings and 88.5% had cementitious facade finishes with 66.8% of them having their facade finishes exposed to moisture. Further, 64% of the facade finishes, mainly of cementitious materials and paints were colonized by microorganisms with the most common microbes being fungi. Facade finishes exposed to moisture we found to be four times more likely to experience biodeterioration. The study concludes that in order to curb microbial colonization of facade finishes and the attendant adverse effects, architects should engage in design strategies that can minimize the level of exposure of facade finishes to moisture.","[Isiofia, Lawrence A.] Enugu State Univ Sci & Technol ESUT, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Architecture, Enugu Campus, Agbani, Enugu, Nigeria; [Uzuegbuman, Francis O.; Ibem, Eziyi O.] Univ Nigeria, Dept Architecture, Nsukka, Nigeria",University of Nigeria,"Isiofia, LA (corresponding author), Enugu State Univ Sci & Technol ESUT, Fac Environm Sci, Dept Architecture, Enugu Campus, Agbani, Enugu, Nigeria.",lmbconsultants2@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 4,2022,65,3,,,,,175,184,,10.1080/00038628.2022.2081126,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00038628.2022.2081126,,JUN 2022,,Architecture,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000803021600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Camera configuration indeed poses a challenge on the traditional photogrammetric pipeline used in commercial software but, on the other hand, gives the opportunity to exploit the additional information provided by the oblique views and allows a more reliable feature extraction. In particular, the information that can be provided in correspondence of building facades can open new possibilities for the building detection and footprint extraction. In this paper, a methodology for the automated extraction of building footprints from oblique imagery is presented.

To address these problems, we designed a progressive generative adversarial network in this paper. The generative network mainly contains a progressive feature generation module and an adaptive consistent attention module, and the discriminator network uses SN-PatchGAN. The network performs recursive inpainting from the edge to the centre, and the repaired features are used as the conditions for the next feature generation, which makes the constraints of the central content gradually strengthened. In order to obtain distant information from the feature maps as well as to consider the possible problem of inconsistency between feature mappings under different recursions when using attention directly in the progressive inpainting network, we designed an adaptive consistent attention module in this paper, which can adaptively combine scores obtained from different recursions to capture more feature information.

Occlusion refers to facade of the face image which can be due to sunglasses, hair or wrapping of facial image by scarf or other accessories.

However, since the imaging mode of SAR is side-by-side, the TomoSAR point cloud of a single orbit cannot achieve a complete observation of buildings. It is difficult for existing methods to extract the same features, as well as to use the overlap rate to achieve the alignment of the homologous TomoSAR point cloud and the cross-source TomoSAR point cloud. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust alignment method for TomoSAR point clouds in urban areas. First, noise points and outlier points are filtered by statistical filtering, and density of projection point (DoPP)-based projection is used to extract TomoSAR building point clouds and obtain the facade points for subsequent calculations based on density clustering. Subsequently, coarse alignment of source and target point clouds was performed using principal component analysis (PCA). Lastly, the rotation and translation coefficients were calculated using the angle of the normal vector of the opposite facade of the building and the distance of the outer end of the facade projection.

For the homologous TomoSAR point cloud, the experimental results show that the average rotation error of the proposed method was less than 0.1 degrees, and the average translation error was less than 0.25 m.

As Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Artificial Intelligence technologies have already developed enough to show significant influences on art, the follow-ing topic considers the merging of architecture and digital art, which are building immersive experiences together. The aim of this paper is to establish the level of inseparability and the type of connection between spatial and digital aspects that cooperatively stimulate and define the movement of visitors. As the creative capacity of architecture and digital art is unlimited in production, three country pavilions, Brazilian, South Korean, and Italian at Expo Dubai 2020, with distinct concepts are analyzed. Selected pavilions were showing diverse approaches to the application of digital technologies within the space, which makes new possible categories to be explored. A strongly emphasized multisensory aspect of spatial experience can be discovered through simple architectural technology in the Brazilian pavilion combined with the symbolic element of water, sounds, and vapors together with digital projections. Symbiosis of digital and architectural components of space is reached in the Italian pavilion by the double shifting of both digital and physical parts of the rope facade. The apparent combination of digital and analog surfaces on the kinetic facade in the Korean pavilion completes the basis for discussion about methods of hybridization of architecture and digital art. Although architecture is, ac-cording to Peter Sloterdijk, the original form of immersion, the selected pavilions demonstrate that participants of the state-of-the-art symbiosis of architecture and digital art can experience new types of immersive reception, simultaneously showcasing the application of the concept of mimesis.","[Gogic, Sanja; Prodanovic, Duska] Univ Belgrade, Fac Architecture, Belgrade, Serbia; [Prodanovic, Duska] Inst Architecture & Urban & Spatial Planning Serbi, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Gogic, S (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Architecture, Belgrade, Serbia.",sanja_gogic@yahoo.com; duskaprodanovic@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2022,29,,,,,,43,55,,10.25038/am.v0i29.535,http://dx.doi.org/10.25038/am.v0i29.535,,,,Art,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000905427200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, we demonstrate how an efficient car detector for aerial images with minimal hand labeling effort can be build. We use an on-line boosting algorithm to incrementally improve the detection results. Initially, we train the classifier with a single positive (car) example, randomly drawn from a fixed number of given samples. When applying this detector to an image we obtain many false positive detections. We use information from a stereo matcher to detect some of these false positives (e.g. detected cars on a facade) and feed back this information to the classifier as negative updates. This improves the detector considerably, thus reducing the number of false positives. We show that we obtain similar results to hand labeling by iteratively applying this strategy.

Mathematical games provide a framework for, studying intelligent behavior in models of real-world settings or restricted domains. The behavior of alternative strategies in these games is defined by each individual's stimulus-response mapping. Limiting these behaviors to linear functions of the environmental conditions renders the results to be little more than a facade: effective decision making in any complex environment almost always requires nonlinear stimulus-response mappings The obstacle then comes in choosing the appropriate representation and learning algorithm. Neural networks and evolutionary algorithms provide useful means for addressing these issues. This paper describes efforts to hybridize neural and evolutionary computation to learn appropriate strategies in zero- and nonzero-sum,games, including the iterated prisoner's dilemma, tic-tac-toe, and checkers. With respect to checkers, the evolutionary algorithm was able to discover a neural network that can be used to play at a near-expert level without injecting expert knowledge about how To play the game. The implications of evolutionary learning with respect to machine intelligence ale also discussed. It is argued that evolution provides the framework for explaining naturally occuring intelligent entities and can be used to design machines that are also capable of intelligent behavior.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; Nat Select Inc, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Natural Selection Inc.,"Chellapilla, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",kchellap@ece.ucsd.edu; dfogel@natural-selection.com,,,,,,,,113,117,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,1999,87,9,,,,,1471,1496,,10.1109/5.784222,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/5.784222,,,,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000082176700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, laser-scanned point clouds are often difficult to analyze, visualize, and interpret due to incompletely scanned building facades caused by numerous sources of defects such as noise, occlusions, and moving objects. Several point cloud scene completion algorithms have been proposed in the literature, but they have been mostly applied to individual objects or small-scale indoor environments and not on large-scale scans of building facades. This paper introduces a method of performing point cloud scene completion of building facades using orthographic projection and generative adversarial inpainting methods. The point cloud is first converted into the 2D structured representation of depth and color images using an orthographic projection approach. Then, a data-driven 2D inpainting approach is used to predict the complete version of the scene, given the incomplete scene in the image domain. The 2D inpainting process is fully automated and uses a customized generative-adversarial network based on Pix2Pix that is trainable end-to-end. The inpainted 2D image is finally converted back into a 3D point cloud using depth remapping. The proposed method is compared against several baseline methods, including geometric methods such as Poisson reconstruction and hole-filling, as well as learning-based methods such as the point completion network (PCN) and TopNet. Performance evaluation is carried out based on the task of reconstructing real-world building facades from partial laser-scanned point clouds. Experimental results using the performance metrics of voxel precision, voxel recall, position error, and color error showed that the proposed method has the best performance overall.","[Chen, Jingdao] Georgia Inst Technol, Inst Robot & Intelligent Machines, 801 Atlantic Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Yi, John Seon Keun; Kahoush, Mark] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci, 801 Atlantic Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Cho, Erin S.] Alpharetta High Sch, 3595 Webb Bridge Rd, Alpharetta, GA 30005 USA; [Cho, Yong K.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 790 Atlantic Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Chen, JD (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, Inst Robot & Intelligent Machines, 801 Atlantic Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",jchen490@gatech.edu; johnsk95@gatech.edu; mkahoush3@gatech.edu; sinahecho@gmail.com; yong.cho@ce.gatech.edu,,,,,,,,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2020,20,18,,,,,,,5029,10.3390/s20185029,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s20185029,,,,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000580412800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, the suitability and geometric accuracy of four UAV-based image acquisition and data processing scenarios for topographic surveying applications in complex terrain are assessed and compared. The specific cases include the use of: 1) nadir imagery; 2) nadir and oblique imagery; 3) nadir and facade imagery; and 4) nadir, oblique, and facade imagery to reconstruct a topographically complex natural surface. Results illustrate that including oblique and facade imagery to supplement the more traditional nadir collections significantly improves the geometric accuracy of point cloud data reconstruction by approximately 35% when assessed against terrestrial laser scanning data of near-vertical rock walls. Most points (99.41%) had distance errors of less than 50 cm between the point clouds derived from the nadir imagery and nadir-oblique-facade imagery. Apart from delivering enhanced spatial resolution in facade details, the geometric accuracy improvements achieved from integrating nadir, oblique, and facade imagery provide value for a range of applications, including geotechnical and geohazard investigations.

By comparing the relationships between exposure and annoyance for areas both with and without significant vibration exposure, the noise levels and vibration velocities that had an equal probability of causing annoyance was determined using logistic regression. The comparison gives a continuous mapping between vibration velocity in the ground and a corresponding noise level at the facade that are equally annoying. For equivalent noise level at the facade compared to maximum weighted vibration velocity in the ground the probability of annoyance is approximately 20% for 59 dB or 0.48 mm/s, and about 40% for 63 dB or 0.98 mm/s.","[Ogren, Mikael; Smith, Michael; Waye, Kerstin Persson] Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Acad, Inst Med, Occupat & Environm Med, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Gidlof-Gunnarsson, Anita] Orebro Univ, Fac Med & Hlth, Dept Occupat & Environm Med, S-70281 Orebro, Sweden; [Gustavsson, Sara] Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Acad, Inst Med, Hlth Metr Unit, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg; Orebro University; University of Gothenburg,"Ögren, M (corresponding author), Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Acad, Inst Med, Occupat & Environm Med, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",mikael.ogren@amm.gu.se; anita.gidlof-gunnarsson@regionorebrolan.se; michael.smith@amm.gu.se; sara.gustavsson@gu.se; kerstin.persson.waye@amm.gu.se,,,,,,,,17,18,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2017,14,7,,,,,,,805,10.3390/ijerph14070805,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph14070805,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000407370700137,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, besides the top-view features (including elevation), facade captured by the oblique images is useful but severely underutilized in the land-cover classification. The facade information of an object, is by nature more variable, thus can be extremely useful when the extracted features are used for land-cover classification. Hence, in this paper, we try to explore the use of facade from the oblique images to enhance the accuracy of land-cover classification. Firstly, we locate the facades by finding the elevation changes and the corresponding above-ground objects. Then, the facade images are cropped from oblique images and the color and Haar-like features are extracted as facade features. Finally, following the object-based land-cover classification, super-pixels are generated and used as the basic unit for the feature extraction and classification. Experiments are performed on five representative site using five-head oblique aerial images and their derived orthophoto and digital surface model (DSM). The results show that with the facade information, the classification performances have been steadily improved, especially for the buildings which has around 10% improvement.","[Xiao, Changlin; Ling, Xiao] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Singapore ETH Ctr, Future Cities Lab, 1 Create Way,CREATE Tower,06-01, Singapore 138602, Singapore; [Xiao, Changlin; Qin, Rongjun] Ohio State Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Geodet Engn, 218B Bolz Hall,2036 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Qin, Rongjun] Ohio State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 205 Dreese Labs,2015 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Yuan, Hanning] Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, 5 South St, Beijing, Peoples R China",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Beijing Institute of Technology,"Xiao, CL (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Singapore ETH Ctr, Future Cities Lab, 1 Create Way,CREATE Tower,06-01, Singapore 138602, Singapore.;Xiao, CL (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Geodet Engn, 218B Bolz Hall,2036 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,,,,,,,5944,5947,,,,,,,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000519270605180,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, the loss function of the cGAN model is modified by combining the adversarial loss of state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models with a new combi-nation of non-adversarial loss functions to enhance model performance and generate more realistic images. Specifically, the effect of the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), the WGAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP), and least Squared GAN (lsGAN) adversarial loss functions are explored. Several comparisons are performed to select an optimized combination of L1 with structure, gradient, content-based, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and softmax non-adversarial loss functions. For experimentation purposes, the Facades dataset is used in case of image-to-image translation task. Peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Universal Quality Index (UQI), and Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) are used to quantitatively evaluate the translated images. Based on our experimental results, the best combination of the loss functions for image-to-image translation on facade dataset is (WGAN) adversarial loss with (L1 and content) non-adversarial loss functions.

However, automating such a task is challenging due to irregular point distribution and complex urban scenes. Incorporating contextual information is crucial in improving classification accuracy of point clouds. In this article, we propose a hierarchical approach for point cloud classification with 3-D contextual features, which comprises three steps:segment-based classification with primitive features and a random forest classifier; extracting novel 3-D contextual features from the initial labels considering spatial relationships between neighboring segments and semantic dependencies; and refining classification with a combination of primitive features and spatial contextual features, and a hierarchical multilayer perceptron classifier that considers primitive features and spatial contextual features at different levels. The proposed method was tested on two point cloud datasets:the National University of Singapore (NUS) dataset and the Vaihingen benchmark dataset of the International Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing. The evaluation results showed that the proposed method achieved an overall accuracy of 92.51% and 82.34% for the NUS dataset and Vaihingen dataset, respectively. The feature importance evaluation showed that 3-D spatial contextual features contributed useful information for discriminating different classes, such as roof, facade, grassland, tree, and ground. Quantitative comparisons further showed that the proposed method is more advantageous, especially in the detection of class roof and facade.","[Feng, Chen-Chieh] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Guo, Zhou] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geospatial Engn & Sci, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China",National University of Singapore; Sun Yat Sen University,"Guo, Z (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geospatial Engn & Sci, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China.",geofcc@nus.edu.sg; guozhou@pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,14,,,,,,5036,5048,,10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3077568,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3077568,,,,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000658340100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Automatic analyses of thermal data, which minimize the subjectivity of the assessment and allow for large-scale inspections, are therefore of high interest. In this study, we propose an approach for a supervised extraction of facade openings (windows and doors) from photogrammetric 3D point clouds attributed to RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) information. The novelty of the proposed approach is in the combination of thermal information with other available characteristics of data for a classification performed directly in 3D space. Images acquired in visible and thermal infrared spectra serve as input data for the camera pose estimation and the reconstruction of 3D scene geometry. To investigate the relevance of different information types to the classification performance, a Random Forest algorithm is applied to various sets of computed features. The best feature combination is then used as an input for a Conditional Random Field that enables us to incorporate contextual information and consider the interaction between the points. The evaluation executed on a per-point level shows that the fusion of all available information types together with context consideration allows us to extract objects with 90% completeness and 95% correctness.

Therefore, many office buildings use large windows and glass facades to let more daylight into office spaces. However, this increases the chance of glare in office spaces, which results in visual discomfort. Shading systems in buildings can prevent glare but are not effectively adapted to changing sky conditions and sun position, thus losing valuable daylight. Moreover, many shading systems are also aesthetically unappealing. Electrochromic (EC) glass in this regard might be a better alternative, due to its light transmission properties that can be altered when a voltage is applied. EC glass facilitates zoning and also supports control of each zone separately. This allows the right amount of daylight at any time of the day. However, an effective control strategy is still required to efficiently control EC glass. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising control strategy that can learn from rewards and penalties and use this feedback to adapt to user inputs. We trained a Deep Q learning (DQN) agent on a set of weather data and visual comfort data, where the agent tries to adapt to the occupant's feedback while observing the sun position and radiation at given intervals. The trained DQN agent can avoid bright daylight and glare scenarios in 97% of the cases and increases the amount of useful daylight up to 90%, thus significantly reducing the need for artificial lighting.","[Kalyanam, Raghuram; Hoffmann, Sabine] Univ Kaiserslautern, Fac Civil Engn, Paul Ehrlich Str 14, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany",University of Kaiserslautern,"Kalyanam, R; Hoffmann, S (corresponding author), Univ Kaiserslautern, Fac Civil Engn, Paul Ehrlich Str 14, D-67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany.",raghuramkalyanam@gmail.com; Sabine.Hoffmann@bauing.uni-kl.de,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2021,11,15,,,,,,,6949,10.3390/app11156949,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app11156949,,,,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000681848100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The tower subsystems are classified into five groups as the load-bearing structure, floor system, vertical circulation system, facade, and environmental system. The aspects of multi-functionality and co-adaptation are articulated through the investigation of specific biological models in nature. The biomimetic analogies are the mechanical and organizational properties of branched constructions, the mechanical properties of the bamboo stem, and the microstructure of the porcupine quill/ hedgehog spine. The main motive behind selecting these natural structures is their shared property of increasing buckling resistance against environmental factors by self-organizing their material arrangement via certain geometrical rules. Moreover, the quality of multi-functionality is observed through the achievement of geometrical differentiation to the same material organization across vertical and horizontal axes. The methodology formulated by design parameters lays the foundations for a new integration approach, termed as multi-parameter integration, where the focus is set on the convergence of multiple design parameters simultaneously. Design explorations are carried out in the open-source programming language Processing via real-time generative form-finding techniques. Biomimetic analogies formulate the principals of geometrical behaviour mechanisms which, together with motion behaviour mechanisms, establish the geometrical parameters of the devised methodology. Geometrical behaviour mechanisms are inscribed in the data structure of various agent systems, each of which is responsible for generating a tower subsystem. The output model combines key properties of the biomimetic principles with geometrical and mathematical descriptions in order to devise a differentiated tower formation where the discrete subsystems behave in an inter-dependent manner.","[Erdine, Elif] AA Summer DLAB & AA Istanbul Visiting Sch, Istanbul, Turkey; [Erdine, Elif] Zaha Hadid Architects, London, England",,"Erdine, E (corresponding author), Architectural Assoc, London, England.",,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2015,,,,,,,172,183,,,,,,,"Architecture; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Construction & Building Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000383865300019,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, traditional Pix2Pix models suffer from significant drawbacks in image generation, such as the loss of important information features during the encoding and decoding processes, as well as a lack of constraints during the training process. To address these issues and improve the quality of Pix2Pixgenerated images, this paper introduces two key enhancements. Firstly, to reduce information loss during encoding and decoding, we utilize the U-Net++ network as the generator for the Pix2Pix model, incorporating denser skip-connection to minimize information loss. Secondly, to enhance constraints during image generation, we introduce a specialized discriminator designed to distinguish differential images, further enhancing the quality of the generated images. We conducted experiments on the facades dataset and the sketch portrait dataset from the Chinese University of Hong Kong to validate our proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate that our improved Pix2Pix model significantly enhances image quality and outperforms other models in the selected metrics. Notably, the Pix2Pix model incorporating the differential image discriminator exhibits the most substantial improvements across all metrics. An analysis of the experimental results reveals that the use of the U-Net++ generator effectively reduces information feature loss, while the Pix2Pix model incorporating the differential image discriminator enhances the supervision of the generator during training.

To address this gap, a new procedure has been developed with a five-step optimization process relevant to examining urban forms with buildings density constraints, window-to-wall ratio, incident solar radiation and energy production potential in facades. Factors analyzed include floor space intensity (FSI), building height (H), spatial daylight autonomy (sDA), annual sun exposure (ASE) and the effect of facade tilt angles on efficiency targets in cold climates. A myriad of parametric functions has been incorporated in the process through Grasshopper, DIVA, ArchSIM, and evolutionary algorithms in Galapagos. The study revealed effective results of energy production across prominent facade design options. Increasing FSI was found to decrease sDA, for a fixed H. In contrast, increasing H for a fixed FSI decreased sDA with an insignificant magnitude of 4%. The ratio of increase in glazing to increase in sDA was in the order of 1:1.47. Overall, the findings showed novelty in optimizing each facade panel to achieve best performance demonstrated by different urban densities with low/mid/high-rise building conditions. Energy production reached 13 kWh/m(2) with integrated photovoltaics, as a renewable source. High-rise buildings showed the best conceivable energy improvement as opposed to other height conditions. The improvement percentage was observed to be directly proportional to the height difference between the studied building and the surrounding context.","[Saad, Mostafa M.] Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, 1515 Rue St Catherine O, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M, Canada; [Araji, Mohamad T.] Univ Waterloo, Sch Architecture, 7 Melville St South, Cambridge, ON N1S 2H4, Canada",Concordia University - Canada; University of Waterloo,"Saad, MM (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, 1515 Rue St Catherine O, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M, Canada.",mostafa.saad@mail.concordia.ca,,,,,,,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021,43,,,,,,,,103109,10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103109,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103109,,AUG 2021,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000701865800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

One of the major research areas under this scope is the adaptive behavior of structural elements affected by load distribution. In order to achieve this, current studies develop structures that adapt by either following a database of precalculated equilibrium solutions or using self-learning algorithms to acquire active control systems to structures. This paper examined a case study element, which demonstrates an adaptive behavior in real time, based on self-learning abilities. The focus of this experiment was to gain control over a structural system as a whole (not only on a singular component) according to both objective and subjective parameters, that is, both load distribution parameters and spatial parameters, which are design related. The examined structural element was a canopy, situated in a dynamic environment that brought a change in the element's load distribution. The learning ability was given by applying a supervised learning algorithm-Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-on a physical prototype. The ANN was trained by an optimized database of finite solutions, which was created by a Genetic Algorithm. Through this method, complex calculations are conducted offline'', and the component operates in a decision-making'' mode in real time, adapting to a versatile environment while using minimal computational resources. Results show that the case study successfully exhibited self-learning and acquired the ability to adapt to unpredictable changing forces while keeping certain design requirements. This method can be applied over different structural elements (facade elements, canopies, structural components, etc.) to achieve adaptation to various parameters with an unpredictable pattern, such as human behavior or weather conditions.","[Sher, Elite; Glynn, Ruairi] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Chronis, Angelos] UCL, Bartlett Sch Grad Studies, Appl Res Dev Grp Foster Partners & Teaches, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London,"Sher, E (corresponding author), Flat 2,36 Alexandra Grove, London N12 8HG, England.",elitesher@gmail.com,,,,,,,,5,6,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2014,90,8,,,SI,,991,1006,,10.1177/0037549714543090,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0037549714543090,,,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Software Engineering",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000340717900009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The model paints and a standard paint, with and without fungicide, were applied on panels of Norway spruce (Picea abies L Karst.) and exposed outdoors for nearly three years according to a modified version of EN 927-3. A logistic regression model was fit to the data, and the degree of mould growth varied with exposure time and type of paint.

The proposed approach takes a prebuilt global grid map as prior knowledge for localization. Model based feature extraction method is introduced to provide laser points classification, with each extracted point allocated a specified weight to describe local characteristic. The prior grid map is generated from weighted point cloud to be able to describe the local metric features such as curbs and building facades. Localization function is then carried out with a weight point based maximum likelihood matching method to determine the correspondence between local point cloud and the reference grid map. There are also position initialization and reference map management modules to make the framework more practical and reliable.

A binomial logistic regression analysis was undertaken to establish links between a range of design, perceptions and socio-demographic variables and individuals' decisions to interact with a smart media display. The results showed that the aesthetics of an installation, the quality of an installation's content and the safety of the operation-friendly environment significantly affected respondents' decisions to interact with the media display. Interestingly, respondents born overseas were more likely to interact with a smart display than those born in Australia. Respondents who expressed a preference for photograph-based interactions were also more likely to interact with the display.

Data sets with real aggregated electricity demand from grid distribution transformers were used and the PV potential of building facades and rooftops was estimated. The amount of PV in each orientation in the facades and rooftops was optimized maximizing self-sufficiency and minimizing net load variance. Two storage management strategies were investigated: one for maximizing self-consumption and the other to reduce net load variance. We show that the aggregation of the demand and PV potential from different building surfaces in the urban context translates into a better demand-supply match, therefore minimizing storage needs.

The output from this process can be used as input for further processing steps, such as modelling, registration and calibration. However, the sparseness and heterogeneity of Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point clouds may lead to problems for existing planar surfaces detection and segmentation methods. This paper proposes a new method that can be applicable to detect and segment planar features in sparse and heterogeneous MLS point clouds. This method utilises the scan profile patterns and the planarity values between different neighbouring scan profiles to detect and segment planar surfaces from MLS point clouds. The proposed method is compared to the three most state-of-the-art segmentation methods (e.g. RANSAC, a robust segmentation method based on robust statistics and diagnostic principal component analysis RDCPA as well as the plane detection method based on line arrangement). Three datasets are used for the validation of the results. The results show that our proposed method outperforms the existing methods in detecting and segmenting planar surfaces in sparse and heterogeneous MLS point clouds. In some instances, the state-of-the-art methods produce incorrect segmentation results for facade details which have a similar orientation, such as for windows and doors within a facade. While RDCPA produces up to 50% of outliers depending on the neighbourhood threshold, another method could not detect such features at all. When dealing with small features such as a target, some algorithms (including RANSAC) were unable to perform segmentation. However, the propose algorithm was demonstrated to detect all planes in the test data sets correctly.

Logistic regression was performed in a large population based cohort study (GLOBE), including over 18 000 subjects, to study the association between exposure at the dwelling facade and sleep problems. Measures of sleep problems were collected by questionnaire with two questions: Do you in general get up tired and not well rested in the morning? and Do you often use sleep medication or tranquilizers? After adjustment for potential confounders, a significant association was found between noise exposure and the risk of getting up tired and not rested in the morning. Although prevalence of medication use was higher at higher noise levels compared to the reference category (L-night < 35 dB), after adjustment for covariates this association was not significant. Long-term road traffic noise exposure is associated with increased risk of getting up tired and not rested in the morning in the general population. This result extends the earlier established relationship between long-term noise exposure and self-reported sleep disturbance assessed with questions that explicitly referred to noise and indicates that road traffic noise exposure during the night may have day-after effects.

Logistic regression was performed in a large population based study (GLOBE, N similar to 18 000), to study the association between road traffic noise exposure at the most exposed dwelling facade (L-den) and annoyance in: (1) The subgroup with a relatively quiet facade (large difference in road traffic noise level between most and least exposed fac, ade (Q > 10 dB); (2) the subgroup without a relatively quiet facade (Q < 10 dB). Questionnaire data were linked to individual exposure assessment based on detailed spatial data (GIS) and standard modeling techniques. Annoyance was less likely (ORQ>10 < ORQ<10) in the subgroup with relatively quiet fac, ade compared to the subgroup without relatively quiet facade.

This leads to a decrease in the revenue associated with commercial activities or services (e.g., shops, restaurants, residences), and potentially reduces tourism in a region. Visual data, in the form of photographs, is becoming an efficient mechanism to record information. Photographs can be quickly captured, and are already frequently posted online by ordinary citizens (e.g., tourists, residents, visitors). Exploiting image data through automation and computer vision provides a new opportunity to simplify the current manual graffiti-monitoring processes, enabling automated detection, localization, and quantification of such markings. In this study, we developed a vision-based graffiti-detection technique using a convolutional neural network. Images collected from historical structures of interest within a community can be utilized to automatically inspect for graffiti markings. In the case in which citizens collect and contribute data, there is a high degree of duplication and repetition, and potentially a lack of GPS information. These hinder the direct use of the images for automating the process. To address these challenges, we built high-resolution, single-view facade images (orthophotos) before applying our robust graffiti detector. The robust graffiti detector was built using a database with 1022 images of damaged or contaminated structures gathered during a recent European Union project, entitled Safeguarding Cultural Heritage through Technical and Organisational Resources Management (STORM). A total of 818 images were used for training (10% of the training set was randomly chosen for the validation set), achieving 88% accuracy among the remaining 204 samples for testing. Using the trained detector, the technique developed was demonstrated using data collected from the Church of Agios Nikolaos (Leontariou), Kantza, Greece.","[Choi, Jongseong; Ortiz, Ricardo] State Univ New York, Dept Mech Engn, SUNY Korea, Incheon 21985, South Korea; [Choi, Jongseong] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Mech Engn, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Toumanidis, Lazaros; Charalampos, Patrikakis; Kasnesis, Panagiotis] Univ West Attica, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Egaleo 12241, Greece; [Yeum, Chul Min] Univ Waterloo, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 2G1, Canada; [Lenjani, Ali] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Liu, Xiaoyu; Dyke, Shirley J.] Purdue Univ, Sch Mech Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA; [Jiang, Ning-Jun] Southeast Univ, Inst Geotech Engn, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China; [Dyke, Shirley J.] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Stony Brook; University of West Attica; University of Waterloo; Stanford University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Southeast University - China; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Choi, J (corresponding author), State Univ New York, Dept Mech Engn, SUNY Korea, Incheon 21985, South Korea.;Choi, J (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Mech Engn, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",jongseong.choi@stonybrook.edu; laztoum@uniwa.gr; cmyeum@uwaterloo.ca; bpatr@uniwa.gr; alenjani@stanford.edu; liu1787@purdue.edu; pkasnesis@uniwa.gr; ricardo.ortiz@stonybrook.edu; jiangn@seu.edu.cn; sdyke@purdue.edu,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2022,12,6,,,,,,,2983,10.3390/app12062983,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app12062983,,,,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000776023200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the reliability and consistency of these methods across different locations and time remains largely unexplored. We aim to develop a comprehensive index of urban quality and change at the street segment level using Google Street View (GSV) imagery. We focus on eight object classes that indicate urban decay or contribute to an unsightly urban space, such as potholes, graffiti, garbage, tents, barred or broken windows, discolored or dilapidated facades, weeds, and utility markings. We train an object detection model on a dataset of images from different cities and assess the performance of these urban indices. We evaluate the effectiveness of this method in various urban contexts over time and discuss its potential for urban planning and public policy.

With the advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, aerial imagery is indispensable for urban environmental studies because it can quickly cover large-scale city areas that contain rich thematic information. However, various methods are elaborately designed for glass or transparent object detection in natural images but not for glass facades in oblique aerial images. In oblique aerial images, glass facade panels with salient boundaries are spatially related and have various sizes and appearances. For the glass facade segmentation task, we notice that semantic and instance segmentation methods have different strengths and failures. To get the best of both worlds, this letter presents an ensemble method to segment glass facades in oblique aerial images. A novel annotation strategy is adopted to preserve the spatial relationship between glass facade panels, and edge features are extracted to improve the detector's performance. Furthermore, we contribute a glass facade segmentation dataset (GFSD) to evaluate our method, which is a supplement to UAV image datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy effectively improves instance segmentation methods, and the ensemble method outperforms the single models with an F1 score of 95.48%.","[Mao, Zhu; Huang, Xianfeng; Gong, Yiping; Xiang, Hanyu; Zhang, Fan] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Zhang, F (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.",maoz@whu.edu.cn; huangxf@whu.edu.cn; gongyp15@whu.edu.cn; 2016301110080@whu.edu.cn; zhangfan@whu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,2022,19,,,,,,,,6513305,10.1109/LGRS.2022.3187760,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2022.3187760,,,,"Geochemistry & Geophysics; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000838529500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this work, a static reference map is created from a Mobile Mapping light detection and ranging (LiDAR) dataset. The data was obtained in 14 measurement runs from March to October 2017 in Hannover and consists in total of about 15 billion points. The point cloud data are first segmented by region growing and then processed by a random forest classification, which divides the segments into the five static classes (facade, pole, fence, traffic sign, and vegetation) and three dynamic classes (vehicle, bicycle, person) with an overall accuracy of 94%. All static objects are entered into a voxel grid, to compare different measurement epochs directly. In the next step, the classified voxels are combined with the result of a visibility analysis. Therefore, we use a ray tracing algorithm to detect traversed voxels and differentiate between empty space and occlusion. Each voxel is classified as suitable for the static reference map or not by its object class and its occupation state during different epochs. Thereby, we avoid to eliminate static voxels which were occluded in some of the measurement runs (e.g. parts of a building occluded by a tree). However, segments that are only temporarily present and connected to static objects, such as scaffolds or awnings on buildings, are not included in the reference map. Overall, the combination of the classification with the subsequent entry of the classes into a voxel grid provides good and useful results that can be updated by including new measurement data.","[Voelsen, Mirjana] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Photogrammetrie & GeoInformat, Hannover, Germany; [Schachtschneider, Julia; Brenner, Claus] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Kartog & Geoinformat, Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover; Leibniz University Hannover,"Voelsen, M (corresponding author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Photogrammetrie & GeoInformat, Hannover, Germany.",voelsen@ipi.uni-hannover.de; julia.schachtschneider@ikg.uni-hannover.de; claus.brenner@ikg.uni-hannover.de,,,,,,,,14,14,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2021,89,3,,,,,195,207,,10.1007/s41064-021-00148-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41064-021-00148-x,,MAY 2021,,Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000647894000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

To keep the solution space as large as possible, it is argued, that it is necessary to vary both topological and metric properties. The combination of both properties is called topo-metric properties. A GM for the generation of facade variants is presented, that is able to systematically vary these topo-metric properties.

Contemporary Harbin needs the help of modern architectural facade forms in the planning of the famous historic city, especially with the facade renovation of old architectures with non-cultural heritage. This paper discusses the possibility of applying advanced image recognition algorithms to the classification of the modern Harbin architectural facade styles and argues that the keys to the classification and positioning of the styles are the forms, the details, and the decorative patterns of the architectural facades, together with the deformation and the quantitative variation factors of the facade decoration symbols. Based on the conventional classification method, the facade styles of Harbin modern architecture were divided into 12 categories after data analysis. To better capture the overall structure information and the style features of the local components in the architectural images, the group convolution and the dilated convolution were added into the ResNet model, and then, the improved channel attention mechanism was introduced to construct a novel CA-MSResNet model. The CA-MSResNet model could more accurately identify the morphological elements and the style categories of the architectures, and the average accuracy reached 87.5%. These techniques, with their promising results, are expected to be further applied in the future research on the sustainable utilization and renovation of Harbin modern architecture.","[Shan, Linlin] Tianjin Normal Univ, Coll Fine Arts & Design, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Long] Tianjin Normal Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Engn, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China",Tianjin Normal University; Tianjin Normal University,"Shan, LL (corresponding author), Tianjin Normal Univ, Coll Fine Arts & Design, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China.;Zhang, L (corresponding author), Tianjin Normal Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Engn, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China.",shanlinlin@tjnu.edu.cn; zhanglong@tjnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2022,14,12,,,,,,,7073,10.3390/su14127073,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14127073,,,,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000816832500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Though solar energy is the most promising renewable energy source for Singapore, there is insufficient space for large scale PV panels deployment and hence PV systems have to be integrated into the building environment. Urban morphology determines the effectiveness of PV panels in the urban environment and hence it is important to design the new developments carefully. However, there is a lack of tool and knowledge to estimate the solar energy potential of a new planning zone, so this study developed morphological based PV output and energy consumption predictive models to identify the urban form for effective PV systems deployment by multilinear regression. Three equations are built for predicting the building cooling energy consumption, PV generation on rooftop and facade and the R-2 of these three equations are 0.33, 0.44 and 0.48 respectively. The regression equations show that the urban setting for maximizing PV generation and minimizing cooling energy consumption is different. Furthermore, the low R-2 values of the three equations reflects that building the predictive models by linear regression may not be the most suitable option and other machine learning algorithms should be explored.","[Poon, Kin Ho] Solar Energy Res Inst Singapore SERIS, Singapore, Singapore; [Poon, Kin Ho] Natl Univ Singapore NUS, Dept Bldg, Singapore, Singapore; [Kaempf, Jerome] Idiap Res Inst, CH-1920 Martigny, Switzerland",National University of Singapore,"Poon, KH (corresponding author), Solar Energy Res Inst Singapore SERIS, Singapore, Singapore.;Poon, KH (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore NUS, Dept Bldg, Singapore, Singapore.",serpkho@nus.edu.sg,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,1343,,,,,,,,12033,10.1088/1742-6596/1343/1/012033,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1343/1/012033,,,,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000561852800033,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite the existence of tangible development projects that bear testimony to Chinese aid to developing countries and which clearly espouse the principles upon which the aid is founded, critics continue to allege that the aid is a facade that enables China to advance its political ideology and vision. Using a corpus-based approach, we investigated the extent to which China's political discourse finds its way into the development aid discourse either by senior party officials or through a government-managed collaborative translation mechanism. To do so, we designed a monolingual corpus of the speeches of top-ranking CPC party officials presented at party-organized events and bilingual (Chinese-English) corpora of the discourse used by Chinese government officials during development aid exchanges. We extracted political terms, based mostly on their frequency of use, from the monolingual corpus and verified the extent of their presence in the bilingual corpora of the development aid discourse. Furthermore, we studied the terms and their contexts of use in the bilingual corpora to determine whether translation served as a medium through which China's political discourse was possibly being introduced into its development aid discourse. Our investigation led us to conclude that China's development aid discourse contains an insignificant amount of political terminology mirroring China's own development path. We also concluded that translation did not constitute, in any tangible way, a means by which the presence of China's political discourse in its development aid discourse could be enhanced. However, we uncovered issues related to terminology management, literal translation, and machine translation which suggest that China was struggling to cope with preserving source text and, presumably, target text linguistic and cultural elements, while taking advantage of current advances in translation technology. We propose both structural and translational modifications that could help China curb anti-development aid criticism while enhancing its development aid discourse.","[Tekwa, Kizito] Guangdong Univ Foreign Studies GDUFS, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Mei, Li] Shanghai Int Studies Univ SHISU, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Guangdong University of Foreign Studies,"Mei, L (corresponding author), Shanghai Int Studies Univ SHISU, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",tekwakizito@gmail.com; meinonlee@shisu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2022,21,,,,,,107,131,,,,,,,Linguistics; Language & Linguistics,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000899362700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the resolution of the LiDAR is not sufficient to identify and evaluate the facade surface features like edges and cracks. Generally, photographs provide a better interpretation of the linear characteristics. The complementary benefits of each allow exploring valuable spatial information with different surface detail levels. The paper introduces a flexible image-based approach for linear feature extraction from LiDAR point cloud. Initially, the algorithm converts the point clouds into a structured depth image to reduce the complexity and computation time. Using transformation matrix and camera calibration parameters, the visible point clouds are perceptively projected into color image space using co-linearity equations. The result depth channel is sampled with the interpolation process and added to the color channels to compute (RGBD) layers. The edges and linear features of the surface are initially extracted using the optical 2D imagery and subsequently, each pixel of the linear features can be projected directly into 3D space. Due to the various acquisition positions of the laser and color images, the issue of occlusion is resolved using the visibility algorithm. Applying the methodology, experimental results from the Treasury Monument of Jordan's ancient Petra City, indicate that the developed approach provides adequate contour points for better interpretation and quantification of weathering processes and dangerous cracking. 3D Modeling these features can also reduce data size, facilitating surface inspection and analysis with simpler models.","[Alshawabkeh, Yahya] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Architecture & Planning, Dept Geomat, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",King Abdulaziz University,"Alshawabkeh, Y (corresponding author), King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Architecture & Planning, Dept Geomat, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.",yalshawabkeh@kau.edu.sa,,,,,,,,22,22,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 18,2020,8,1,,,,,,,28,10.1186/s40494-020-00371-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40494-020-00371-6,,,,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Analytical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Spectroscopy",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000520486500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We propose a novel intensity-based point registration algorithm and incorporate it into the LiDAR odometry, enabling the LO system to jointly estimate the LiDAR ego-motion using both geometric and intensity feature points. To eliminate the interference of dynamic objects, we propose a temporal-based dynamic object removal approach to filter them out in the resulting points map. Moreover, the local map is organized and downsampled using a temporal-related voxel grid filter to maintain the similarity between the current scan and the static local map.

Noise is a stressor, however, little is known about its effects on children's respiratory health. This study investigates the association between pre- or postnatal road traffic or occupational noise exposure and asthma as well as related symptoms from infancy to adolescence. Methods: The study was conducted in the Swedish birth cohort BAMSE, including over 4000 participants followed with repeated questionnaires and clinical tests until 16 years of age. Pre- and postnatal residential road traffic noise was assessed by estimating time-weighted average noise levels at the most exposed facade. Maternal occupational noise exposure during pregnancy was evaluated using a job-exposure-matrix. The associations between noise exposure and asthma-related outcomes were explored using logistic regression and generalised estimating equations. Results: We observed non-significant associations for asthma ever up to 16 years with residential road traffic noise exposure in infancy >= 55 dB(Lden) (adjusted OR = 1.22; 95% CI 0.90-1.65), as well as prenatal occupational noise exposure >= 80 dB(LAeq,8h) (1.18, 0.85-1.62). In longitudinal analyses, however, no clear associations between pre- or postnatal exposure to residential road traffic noise, or average exposure to noise since birth, were detected in relation to asthma or wheeze until 16 years. Conclusion: We did not find a clear overall association between exposure to noise during different time periods and asthma or wheeze up to adolescence.","[Wallas, Alva Enoksson; Eriksson, Charlotta; Pyko, Andrei; Melen, Erik; Pershagen, Goran; Gruzieva, Olena] Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, Nobels Vag 13, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Eriksson, Charlotta; Pyko, Andrei; Sjostrom, Mattias; Pershagen, Goran; Gruzieva, Olena] Ctr Occupat & Environm Med, Stockholm, Region Stockhol, Sweden; [Ogren, Mikael] Univ Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska Acad, Dept Occupat & Environm Med, Gothenburg, Sweden",Karolinska Institutet; University of Gothenburg,"Wallas, AE (corresponding author), Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, Nobels Vag 13, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",alva.enoksson.wallas@ki.se,,,,,,,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2020,185,,,,,,,,109404,10.1016/j.envres.2020.109404,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109404,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000530034100059,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, in earthquake-prone regions, most of this information is out-of-date or nonexistent. This paper proposes a deep learning-based method for automatically identifying building structural types from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) oblique images. The method consists of four steps: (1) collect facades of buildings with different structural types by web crawler technology as a sample set; (2) construct a convolutional neural network with a facade prior knowledge attention branch and train the model using the sample set; (3) extract building facades from UAV oblique images based on the georeferencing results of feature points as the test set; (4) identify building structural types by inputting the test set into the trained model. Three cases have been selected to verify the feasibility and applicability of the method. The average recall rate of 85% and the average F1 score of 83% have been achieved in areas with regular building distribution. This method integrates multidisciplinary knowledge to provide a solution for rapid collection of building vulnerability information, and expands the role of oblique photography data in urban management and disaster prevention planning.","[Zhang, Leilei; Wang, Guoxin; Sun, Weijian] Dalian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Coastal & Offshore Engn, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Leilei; Wang, Guoxin; Sun, Weijian] Dalian Univ Technol, Inst Earthquake Engn, Fac Infrastruct Engn, Dalian, Peoples R China",Dalian University of Technology; Dalian University of Technology,"Wang, GX (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Coastal & Offshore Engn, Dalian, Peoples R China.;Wang, GX (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Inst Earthquake Engn, Fac Infrastruct Engn, Dalian, Peoples R China.",gxwang@dlut.edu.cn,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 31,2023,16,1,,,,,3348,3367,,10.1080/17538947.2023.2247390,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2023.2247390,,,,"Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001053294800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Psychological comfort can cause dissatisfaction with their work. Thus, it is important to understand what factors contribute to employees' satisfaction in workplaces. The purpose of this paper is to identify the weight of contribution of each design parameter on increasing psychological satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach The study included 579 employees in five offices in The Netherlands through an online survey. The typologies of offices vary in terms of office layouts, orientations and facade. Additionally, a parameter of desk location was included as this factor may be associated with user satisfaction. Kruskal-Wallis H test, categorical regression, and logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the impact of these design parameters on psychological user satisfaction. Findings The results revealed the impact of design parameters on the psychological satisfaction. The parameters of office layouts and desk locations were the significant predictor factors for the probability of satisfaction variables (e.g. privacy, concentration, communication, social contact and territoriality). The parameters for optimal satisfaction were found in cellular office, north-west oriented workstation and 4 m away from a window. Originality/value Psychological comfort is an inevitable aspect in user satisfaction studies. This paper, therefore, measures and predicts the relationship between design factors and employees' satisfaction through case studies in The Netherlands. The findings help designers, architects, planners and facility managers to develop user-focussed office design principles supporting employees' work performance.","[Kwon, Minyoung] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Climate Design & Sustainabil, Delft, Netherlands; [Remoy, Hilde] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Management Built Environm, Delft, Netherlands; [Remoy, Hilde] Univ Pavia, Dept Civil Engn & Architecture, Pavia, Italy",Delft University of Technology; Delft University of Technology; University of Pavia,"Kwon, M (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Dept Climate Design & Sustainabil, Delft, Netherlands.",kwminyoung@gmail.com; h.t.remoy@tudelft.nl,,,,,,,,17,18,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,38,1/2,,,,,1,19,,10.1108/F-03-2019-0041,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/F-03-2019-0041,,,,Management,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000507568400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A case study in Shenzhen was conducted to measure the urban facade color using Baidu Street View (BSV) panoramas, with city-scale mapping of the urban facade color in both irregular geographical units and regular grids. Shenzhen's urban facade color has a gray tone with low chroma. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has a high level of accuracy for the extraction of the urban facade color.

However, the surface scratches generated in the manufacturing process or emerging in the service stage such as windborne debris impacts may lead to remarkable strength degradation of glass material. In order to assess the fracture possibility of glass components, the size and number of scratches should be monitored during their lifecycle. Automatic scratch detection of architectural glass therefore remains a necessary task for civil engineers. A pixel-level instance segmentation model using Mask and region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) was proposed for scratches detection on transparent glass surface. Images with scratches were firstly collected by a tailor-made automated microscopic camera scanning system to build the training and validation dataset. Test results demonstrate that the trained network is satisfactory, achieving a mean average precision of 96.5% with low missing and false rate under background interference. A comparison between the proposed model and another segmentation method YOLACT indicates that the proposed model has better performance in both detection and segmentation accuracy. The proposed deep learning-based approach can better support the development of non-contact defect assessment techniques for transparent building materials such as glass. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the data obtained from any measurement system can include inaccurate signals affected by systematic errors or by the external environment. De-noising to remove inaccurate outlier points is a fundamental and challenging problem for ALS-based mapping applications. The proposed method aims to recover the patterned (planar and linear) points within the assigned outlier and removed points. The method consists of 3 steps. First, statistical outlier removal (SOR) filtering is implemented, and outlier points are detected with the filtering method. Next, the machine learning system reclassifies the filtered outlier points. If the classification result is inlier'', that point is added to the filtered inlier point cloud as an inlier point. The accuracy of outlier points was evaluated against a manually determined validation set. The results achieved 99% and 98% according to the highest overall accuracy criterion and kappa coefficient, respectively. These findings are a promising step to test the proposed method in three different test areas and extend it to widespread spatial dimensions. Furthermore, the findings show that many useful points are removed by SOR filtering.

However, the blast loads that apply to structures located in denser environments are significantly affected by the complex interactions of the blast wave with the urban topography. Many existing works address the effects resulting from such interactions; however, their scopes are mostly limited to considering a few buildings or streets, while the influence of building porosity on the shielding effect has received limited attention. This work utilizes validated high-fidelity numerical simulations to carry out a detailed investigation of the influence of a building's porosity (categorized as zero, low, mediumand high) on its capacity to shield virtual facades located at several distances behind the shielding structure. The results show that the shielding effect is mainly bounded below by that behind the high-porosity building and above by that behind the zero or low-porosity building, depending on the standoff distance to the charge. Finally, suitable scaling and modeling approaches including regression and machine learning techniques are applied to devise simplified, yet more general data -driven surrogate tools for computationally inexpensive predictions. These can contribute in helping design engineers evaluate blast loads behind porous structures following explosions in cityscapes. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The need for direct access to traffic data is bypassed by relying on street categorization and a city microphone network. The starting point for the deterministic modeling is a previously developed but simplified dynamic traffic model, the latter necessary to predict statistical and dynamic noise indicators and to estimate the number of noise events. The sound propagation module combines aspects of the CNOSSOS and QSIDE models. In the next step, a machine learning technique-an artificial neural network in this work-is used to weigh the outcomes of the deterministic predictions of various traffic parameter scenarios (linked to street categories) to approach the measured indicators from the microphone network. Application to the city of Barcelona showed that the differences between predictions and measurements typically lie within 2-3 dB, which should be positioned relative to the 3 dB variation in street-side measurements when microphone positioning relative to the facade is not fixed. The number of events is predicted with 30% accuracy. Indicators can be predicted as averages over day, evening and night periods, but also at an hourly scale; shorter time periods do not seem to negatively affect modeling accuracy.

They have been studied and applied during decades for plane rectification, 3D reconstruction, and mainly auto-calibration tasks. Nevertheless, the literature lacks accurate online solutions for multiple vanishing point estimation. Most strategies focalize on the accuracy, using highly computational demanding iterative procedures. We propose a novel strategy for multiple vanishing point estimation that finds a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, being able to operate in real time for video sequences. This strategy takes advantage of the temporal coherence of the images of the sequences to reduce the computational load of the processing algorithms while keeping a high level of accuracy due to an optimization process. The key element of the approach is a robust scheme based on the MLESAC algorithm, which is used in a similar way to the EM algorithm. This approach ensures robust and accurate estimations, since we use the MLESAC in combination with a novel error function, based on the angular error between the vanishing point and the image features. To increase the speed of the MLESAC algorithm, the selection of the minimal sample sets is substituted by a random sampling step that takes into account temporal information to provide better initializations. Besides, for the sake of flexibility, the proposed error function has been designed to work using as image features indiscriminately gradient-pixels or line segments. Hence, we increase the range of applications in which our approach can be used, according to the type of information that is available. The results show a real-time system that delivers real-time accurate estimations of multiple vanishing points for online processing, tested in moving camera video sequences of structured scenarios, both indoors and outdoors, such as rooms, corridors, facades, roads, etc.","[Nieto, Marcos; Salgado, Luis] Univ Politecn Madrid, Grp Tratamiento Imagenes, ETS Ing Telecomunicac, E-28040 Madrid, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Nieto, M (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Grp Tratamiento Imagenes, ETS Ing Telecomunicac, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",mnd@gti.ssr.upm.es,,,,,,,,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,,2010,7724,,,,,,,,772402,10.1117/12.854592,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.854592,,,,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Optics",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000285288700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the architectural field, scanning a building is one of the first possible steps from which a 3D model can be obtained and can be later used for visualisation and/or feature analysis, thanks to computer-based pattern recognition tools. The automation of these tools allows for temporal savings and has become a strong aid for professionals, so that more and more methods are developed with this objective. In this article, a method for 3D mesh segmentation focused on the representation of historic buildings is proposed. This type of buildings is characterised by having singularities and features in facades, such as doors or windows. The main objective is to recognise these features, understanding them as those parts of the model that differ from the main structure of the building. The idea is to use a recognition algorithm for planar faces that allows users to create a graph showing the connectivity between them, therefore allowing the reflection of the shape of the 3D model.

The existing grammar-based approaches for facade parsing rely on strong prior knowledge but can obtain facade parts with better structure. Pixelwise-segmentation-based approaches achieve facade parsing with much less knowledge but the resulting structure of facade parts is normally incomplete. Both these approaches are restricted by their high reliance on the data set. Therefore, they cannot be applied for facade parsing with complex scenes. To address this issue, we built a large street-level data set by taking Mapillary images as the training data for more general scenes. At the same time, we propose a new pipeline based on convolutional neural network (CNN) that combines pixelwise segmentation and global object detection to achieve better results for facade parsing. Our pipeline can be applied to facade images after rectification and street-level facade images with complex scenes. The result of the ablation study demonstrates that the design of our pipeline is effective. We test our pipeline on the classic ECP2011 data set and our new large street-level data set. Our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results for both the data sets: an accuracy of 98.2% and the mean average precision (mAP) of 98.8% on the ECP2011 data set as well as the mAP of 81.1% for facade parts parsing on our street-level data set.","[Kong, Gefei] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Fan, Hongchao] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Wuhan University; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Fan, HC (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",gefeikong@whu.edu.cn; hongchao.fan@ntnu.no,,,,,,,,10,10,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2021,59,12,,,,,10519,10531,,10.1109/TGRS.2020.3035878,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2020.3035878,,,,"Geochemistry & Geophysics; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000722170500054,View Full Record in Web of Science

TLS is new and efficient method to digitize large object or scene. The collected point samples come into different formats and coordinates. Different scans are required to scan large object such as heritage site. Point cloud registration is considered as important task to bring different scans into whole 3D model in one coordinate system. Point clouds can be registered by using one of the three ways or combination of them, Target based, feature extraction, point cloud based. For the present study we have gone through Point Cloud Based registration approach. We have collected partially overlapped 3D Point Cloud data of Department of Computer Science & IT (DCSIT) building located in Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, Aurangabad. To get the complete point cloud information of the building we have taken 12 scans, 4 scans for exterior and 8 scans for interior facade data collection. There are various algorithms available in literature, but Iterative Closest Point (ICP) is most dominant algorithms. The various researchers have developed variants of ICP for better registration process. The ICP point cloud registration algorithm is based on the search of pairs of nearest points in a two adjacent scans and calculates the transformation parameters between them, it provides advantage that no artificial target is required for registration process. We studied and implemented three variants Brute Force, KDTree, Partial Matching of ICP algorithm in MATLAB. The result shows that the implemented version of ICP algorithm with its variants gives better result with speed and accuracy of registration as compared with CloudCompare Open Source software.","[Rajendra, Y.

The paper addresses the problem of single historical photograph analysis and modelling of an architectural object from it. Especially, it focuses on reconstruction of the original look of New-Town synagogue from the single historic photograph, when camera calibration is completely unknown. Due to the fact that the photograph faithfully followed the geometric rules of perspective, it was possible to develop and apply the method to obtain a correct 3D reconstruction of the building. The modelling process consisted of a series of familiar steps: feature extraction, determination of base elements of perspective, dimensional analyses and 3D reconstruction. Simple formulas were proposed in order to estimate location of characteristic points of the building in 3D Cartesian system of axes on the base of their location in 2D Cartesian system of axes. The reconstruction process proceeded well, although slight corrections were necessary. It was possible to reconstruct the shape of the building in general, and two of its facades in detail. The reconstruction of the other two facades requires some additional information or the additional picture. The success of the presented reconstruction method depends on the geometrical content of the photograph as well as quality of the picture, which ensures the legibility of building edges. The presented method of reconstruction is a combination of the descriptive method of reconstruction and computer aid; therefore, it seems to be universal. It can prove useful for single-image-based modelling architecture.","[Dzwierzynska, Jolanta] Rzeszow Univ Technol, Dept Architectural Design & Engn Graph, Poznanska 2, PL-35084 Rzeszow, Poland",Rzeszow University of Technology,"Dzwierzynska, J (corresponding author), Rzeszow Univ Technol, Dept Architectural Design & Engn Graph, Poznanska 2, PL-35084 Rzeszow, Poland.",joladz@prz.edu.pl,,,,,,,,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,,2017,245,,,,,,,,62015,10.1088/1757-899X/245/6/062015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/245/6/062015,,,,"Architecture; Engineering, Civil; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Urban Studies",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000419056403091,View Full Record in Web of Science

A sample of 1349 people in and around Oslo in Norway exposed to railway noise was studied in a cross-sectional survey to obtain data on sleep disturbances, sleep problems due to noise, and personal characteristics including noise sensitivity. Individual noise exposure levels were determined outside of the bedroom facade, the most-exposed facade, and inside the respondents' bedrooms. The exposure-response relationships were analyzed by using logistic regression models, controlling for possible modifying factors including the number of noise events (train pass-by frequency). L-p,L-A,L-eq,L-night and L-p,L-A,L-max were significantly correlated, and the proportion of reported noise-induced sleep problems increased as both L-p,L-A,L-eq,L-night and L-p,L-A,L-max increased. Noise sensitivity, type of bedroom window, and pass-by frequency were significant factors affecting noise-induced sleep disturbances, in addition to the noise exposure level. Because about half of the study population did not use a bedroom at the most-exposed side of the house, the exposure-response curve obtained by using noise levels for the most-exposed facade underestimated noise-induced sleep disturbance for those who actually have their bedroom at the most-exposed facade.

According to the results, a decrease in temperature and relative humidity was seen in the case of the building with a green wall. It was found that the green wall could drop the indoor temperature by 9% and also decrease the relative humidity level by 32%. Besides, in order to predict the green wall performance in a short time interval, a deep artificial neural network was trained from the experimental data and a 15-day weather dataset was collected and fed into the deep learning model. Moreover, the ENVI-met software is utilized to evaluate the effect of the green wall on the surrounding air. Findings indicated that the temperature in front of the green wall is slightly lower than the part of the wall without the plant. The highest temperate reduction was 0.36 degrees C at 12 p. m., which is insignificant.","[Daemei, Abdollah Baghaei] Islamic Azad Univ, Rasht Branch, Young Researchers & Elite Club, Rasht, Iran; [Shafiee, Elham] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Architecture & Environm Design, Tehran, Iran; [Chitgar, Amir Arash] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Lahijan Branch, Lahijan, Iran; [Asadi, Somayeh] Penn State Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Islamic Azad University; Iran University Science & Technology; Islamic Azad University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Asadi, S (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Engn Unit A, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",baghaei@iaurasht.ac.ir; e_shafiee@iust.ac.ir; chitgar@liau.ac.ir; sxa51@psu.edu,,,,,,,,16,16,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021,205,,,,,,,,108201,10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108201,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108201,,AUG 2021,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000703176300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This work presents a deep learning approach to predicting the annual output energy harvested by the 2-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, thereby optimizing the tandem structure design. The data set for training and validating an artificial neural network (ANN) is the Atlas-simulated results of the tandem cell with the various perovskite layer's bandgap and thickness under the real-world conditions composed of the solar spectrum, incident spectral angle, and solar module temperature in a particular month of a year for a specific direction. Consequently, we reveal the significant influence of solar spectral shape on the ANN performance. The proposed ANN model has a mean square error of 1.26 and a correlation coefficient of 0.99979. Based on the spectral and environmental database in Gifu (Japan) in 2015, we predict that the optimal perovskite layer's bandgap and thickness are 1.72 eV and 680 nm for the east, south, and west facades, 1.73 eV and 700 nm for the rooftop, respectively. Consequently, the highest annual output energy obtained is 282.54, 105.07, 174.71, and 90.79 kWh/m2 for the rooftop, the east, south, and west facades, respectively. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

For these purposes, the authors put forward an intelligent NRS method that collects the holographic geometric deformation of the test bridge, using the static image sequences. Specifically, a uniaxial automatic cruise acquisition device was designed to collect the dynamic and static images on bridge facade under different damage conditions. Considering the strong spatiotemporal correlations of the sequence data, the relationships between the time history images in six fixed fields of view were identified through deep learning under spatiotemporal sequences. On this basis, the behavioral features of the bridge structure were obtained under vehicle load. Finally, the global holographic deformation of the test bridge and the envelope spectrum of the global holographic deformation were derived from the deformation data. The research results show that the output data of our NRS method were basically consistent with the finite-element prediction (maximum error: 11.11%) and dial gauge measurement (maximum error: 12.12%); the NRS method is highly sensitive to the actual deformation of the bridge structure under different damage conditions and can capture the deformation in a continuous and accurate manner. Compared with the limited number of measuring points, holographic deformation data also shows higher sensitivity in damage identification.","[Deng, Guojun; Zhou, Zhixiang; Chu, Xi; Shao, Shuai] Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Chongqing 400074, Peoples R China; [Deng, Guojun; Zhou, Zhixiang; Shao, Shuai] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Civil & Transportat Engn, Shenzhen 518061, Peoples R China",Chongqing Jiaotong University; Shenzhen University,"Zhou, ZX (corresponding author), Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Chongqing 400074, Peoples R China.;Zhou, ZX (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Coll Civil & Transportat Engn, Shenzhen 518061, Peoples R China.",zhixiangzhou@szu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 20,2020,2020,,,,,,,,2815017,10.1155/2020/2815017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/2815017,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000596103500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the near future, Building Information Models (BIMs) will be used as unique resources for enabling seamless data level interoperability, which will greatly facilitate the processes in the Building Life Cycle. In this context, enabling the collaborative use of BIMs is becoming essential and is much required by the industry for addressing the issues associated with the poor efficiencies in Information Systems (IS) and productivity. On the other hand, in the new IS architectures, service and resource orientation are becoming widely used, in terms of supporting collaboration over distributed environments. This paper introduces three design patterns which will help in facilitating BIM-based information sharing over the web, and web-based collaborative use of the BIMs. The patterns were developed to formalize the approaches in interacting with the shared BIMs over the web. The first pattern - BIM AJAX - explains how AJAX techniques can be used for supporting information retrieval from BIMs. The second pattern - BIM SOAP Facade - provides a standard coarse-grained interface to reach multiple BlMs over the web. The third pattern - RESTful BIM - elaborates on how BIM-based systems can benefit from the REST (Resource Oriented) Architectures. The paper starts with providing an overview on Building Information Models focusing on their characteristics and functions. Following this, the conventional approaches for exchanging and sharing BlMs are presented. The third section elaborates on IS Integration, AJAX and Web Services. Finally, three design patterns that have been developed are presented and discussed in detail. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, roadmap for PCMs' application in carbon -neutral transition is ambiguous in the current academia, and a state-of-the-art overview on latent thermal storage is necessary. In this study, a comprehensive review was conducted on cutting-edge technologies for carbon -neutral transition with latent thermal storages. Both carbon-positive and carbon-negative strategies in the operational stage are reviewed. Carbon-positive solution mainly focuses on energy-efficient buildings, through a series of passive, active, and smart control strategies with artificial intelligence. Passive strategies, to enhance thermal inertia and thermal storage of building envelopes, mainly include free cooling, solar chimney, solar facade, and Trombe walls. Active strategies mainly include mechanical ventilations, active water pipe-embedded radiative cooling, and geothermal system integration. The ultimate target is to minimise building energy de-mands, with improved utilisation efficiency on natural heating (e.g., concentrated solar thermal energy, geothermal heating, and solar-driven ventilative heating) and cooling resources (e.g., ventilative cooling, geothermal cooling, and sky radiative cooling). As one of the most critical solutions to offset the released carbon emission, carbon-negative strategies with PCMs mainly include cleaner power production and waste heat re-covery. Main functions of PCMs include energy efficiency enhancement on cleaner power production, steady steam production, steady heat flux via the latent storage capacity, and pre-heat purpose on waste heat recovery. A thermal energy interaction network with transportation is formulated with PCMs' recovering heat from in-ternal combustion engines and spatiotemporal energy sharing, to provide frontier research guidelines. Future studies are recommended to spotlight standard testing procedure and database, benchmarks for suitable PCMs selection, seasonal cascaded energy storage, nanofluid-based heat transfer enhancement in PCMs, anti-corrosion, compatibility, thermochemical stability, and economic feasibility of PCMs. This study provides a clear roadmap on developing PCMs for transition towards a carbon-neutral district energy community, together with applica-tions, prospects, and challenges, paving the path for combined efforts from chemical materials synthesis and applications.","[Zhou, Yuekuan] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol Guangzhou, Sustainable Energy & Environm Thrust, Funct Hub, Guangzhou 511400, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yuekuan] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yuekuan] HKUST Shenzhen Hong Kong Collaborat Innovat Res In, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yuekuan] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Emerging Interdisciplinary Areas, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhengxuan] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (Guangzhou); Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Delft University of Technology,"Zhou, YK (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol Guangzhou, Sustainable Energy & Environm Thrust, Funct Hub, Guangzhou 511400, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Zhou, YK (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Zhou, YK (corresponding author), HKUST Shenzhen Hong Kong Collaborat Innovat Res In, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.;Zhou, YK (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Div Emerging Interdisciplinary Areas, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Liu, ZX (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.",yuekuanzhou@ust.hk; Z.liu-12@tudelft.nl,,,,,,,,10,10,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2023,89,,,,,,,,104378,10.1016/j.scs.2022.104378,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2022.104378,,DEC 2022,,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Energy & Fuels,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000918635400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Street-scale Air Quality Models (AQMs) are a cheap and efficient way to study air pollution and possibly provide solutions. Having to include all the complex phenomena of wind flow between buildings, AQMs employ several parameterisations, one of which is the recirculation zone. Goal of this study is to derive an implicit or explicit definition for the recirculation zone from the flow in street canyons using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Therefore, a CFD-Large Eddy Simulation model was employed to investigate street canyons with height to width ratio from 1 to 0.20 under perpendicular wind direction. The developed dataset was analyzed with traditional methods (vortex visualization criteria and pollutant dispersion fields), as well as clustering methods (machine learning). Combining the above analyses, it was possible to extract qualitative features that agree well with literature but most importantly to develop quantitative expressions that describe their topology. The extracted features' topology depends strongly on the street canyon dimensions and not surprisingly is independent of the wind velocity. The developed expressions describe areas with common flow characteristics inside the canyon and thus they can be characterised as an implicit definition for the recirculation zone. Furthermore, the presented methodology can be further applied to cover more parameters such us oblique wind direction and heated-facades and more methods for data analysis.","[Chatzimichailidis, Arsenios E.; Assael, Marc J.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Chem Engn, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Argyropoulos, Christos D.; Kakosimos, Konstantinos E.] Texas A&M Univ Qatar, Dept Chem Engn, POB 23874, Doha, Qatar; [Argyropoulos, Christos D.; Kakosimos, Konstantinos E.] Texas A&M Univ Qatar, Mary Kay OConnor Proc Safety Ctr, POB 23874, Doha, Qatar; [Argyropoulos, Christos D.] Natl Ctr Sci Res Demokritos, Inst Nucl & Radiol Sci & Technol Energy & Safety, Syst Reliabil & Ind Safety Lab, Patriarchou Grigoriou & Neapoleos Str, Athens 15310, Greece",Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Qatar Foundation (QF); Texas A&M University Qatar; Qatar Foundation (QF); Texas A&M University Qatar; National Centre of Scientific Research Demokritos,"Kakosimos, KE (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ Qatar, Dept Chem Engn, POB 23874, Doha, Qatar.;Kakosimos, KE (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ Qatar, Mary Kay OConnor Proc Safety Ctr, POB 23874, Doha, Qatar.",archatzi@auth.gr; chris.argyropoulos@ipta.demokritos.gr; assael@auth.gr; k.kakosimos@qatar.tamu.edu,,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2019,10,12,,,,,,,794,10.3390/atmos10120794,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos10120794,,,,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000507369200067,View Full Record in Web of Science

A machine learning algorithm, the Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression was used for developing the model. Hygmthermal simulations were performed for a wood-frame wall with brick cladding using hourly historical and projected future climate data for cities located in different climate zones across Canada. The mould index calculated at the exterior layer of OSB was used as the response variable in the PLS model and the most relevant climate parameters were used as inputs including: temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind-driven rain, and solar radiation normal to the facade. The model was trained using a training set comprising two climate periods and different wall orientations for three cities. It was then used to predict the mould index for other years and wall orientations without performing the simulations. The coefficient of determination (R-2), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was used to evaluate the model's accuracy. Also, ranking and mould risk category analysis were carried out to assess the model's ability to rank the years according to their moisture severity. Results showed that with proper selection of training dataset, the model can be effectively used to predict the hygrothermal performance of brick-clad wood-frame wall assemblies in the selected cities and over both historical and future climates.","[Aggarwal, Chetan; Ge, Hua] Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, 1455 Blvd Maisonneuve Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3G IM8, Canada; [Defo, Maurice; Lacasse, Michael A.] Natl Res Council Canada, Grp Facade Syst & Prod, Construct Res Ctr, 1200 Montreal Rd,Bldg M-24, Ottawa, ON K1A 0R6, Canada",Concordia University - Canada; National Research Council Canada,"Ge, H (corresponding author), Concordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, 1455 Blvd Maisonneuve Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3G IM8, Canada.",,,,,,,,,8,8,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2022,223,,,,,,,,109501,10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.109501,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.109501,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000894303800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

All subjects participated in a National Environmental Health Survey, performed in 2007, in which they reported on health, annoyance reactions and environmental factors. Questionnaire data on self-reported doctors diagnosis of hypertension and/or CVD were used as outcomes. Exposure was assessed as Traffic Load (millions of vehicle kilometres per year) within 500 m around each participants residential address. For a sub-population (n = 2498), we also assessed road traffic and railway noise in L den at the dwelling facade. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess Prevalence Odds Ratios (POR) and 95 Confidence Intervals (CI). No statistically significant associations were found between Traffic Load and self-reported hypertension or CVD. In the sub-population, there was no association between road traffic noise and the outcomes; however, an increased risk of CVD was suggested among subjects exposed to railway noise >= 50 dB(A); POR 1.55 (95 CI 1.00-2.40). Neither Traffic Load nor road traffic noise was, in this study, associated with self-reported cardiovascular outcomes. However, there was a borderline-significant association between railway noise and CVD.

This work tackles the problem of locating floor-level lines in street-view images, using a supervised deep learning approach. Unfortunately, very little data is available for training such a network - current street-view datasets contain either semantic annotations that lack geometric attributes, or rectified facades without perspective priors. To address this issue, we first compile a new dataset and develop a new data augmentation scheme to synthesize training samples by harassing (i) the rich semantics of existing rectified facades and (ii) perspective priors of buildings in diverse street views. Next, we design FloorLevel-Net, a multi-task learning network that associates explicit features of building facades and implicit floor-level lines, along with a height-attention mechanism to help enforce a vertical ordering of floor-level lines. The generated segmentations are then passed to a second-stage geometry post-processing to exploit self-constrained geometric priors for plausible and consistent reconstruction of floor-level lines. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations conducted on assorted facades in existing datasets and street views from Google demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Also, we present context-aware image overlay results and show the potentials of our approach in enriching AR-related applications.

Most studies have adopted design variation parameters as the input parameters for model training, but this method greatly limits the scope of application of the daylight model. By extending application to different design possibilities, this research proposes a novel daylight model, which includes a pre-processing procedure to convert the design model into Intermediary features as input parameters representing daylight penetration performance. By changing geometry of one kind of parametric facade and performing daylighting simulation, we were able to generate the data for training, including Intermediary features and sDA/ASE values. The daylight model was then trained using an artificial neural network. Finally, the proposed daylight model was tested by predicting the daylight performance of other kinds of facades. The results indicated that the value of DA and ASE hours per grid were well predicted and that the daylight distribution was reproduced even with different kinds of facades. The deviations of sDA and ASE from simulation results ranged from 1.7 to 6.1% and 0.3-2.1 h respectively. The reproducibility, the predictive capability, and most importantly the extension of model applicability were all demonstrated for the proposed model. Furthermore, comparing to the daylighting simulation, the method using the proposed daylight model is estimated to save 9/10 daylighting evaluation time. This is critical for implementing the evaluation in the early design stage.","[Lin, Chuan-Hsuan; Tsay, Yaw-Shyan] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Architecture, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University,"Tsay, YS (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Architecture, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 701, Taiwan.",tsayys@mail.ncku.edu.tw,,,,,,,,16,16,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2021,206,,,,,,,,108371,10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108371,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108371,,SEP 2021,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000705893000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, object geometries represented by texturized digital surface models constitute an alternative to a pure evaluation of radiometric measurements. Besides the 3D data's level of detail aspect, its availability is time-relevant in order to make quick decisions. Expanding the concept of our preceding remote sensing platform developed together with OHB System AG and Geosystems GmbH, in this paper we present an airborne multi-sensor system based on a motor glider equipped with two wing pods; one carries the sensors, whereas the second pod downlinks sensor data to a connected ground control station by using the Aerial Reconnaissance Data System of OHB. An uplink is created to receive remote commands from the manned mobile ground control station, which on its part processes and evaluates incoming sensor data. The system allows the integration of efficient image processing and machine learning algorithms. In this work, we introduce a near real-time approach for the acquisition of a texturized 3D data model with the help of an airborne laser scanner and four high-resolution multi-spectral (RGB, near-infrared) cameras.

The photogrammetric point cloud, generated from UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) imagery, is a novel type of data in building reconstruction. Its positive characteristics, alongside its challenging qualities, provoke discussions on this theme of research. In this paper, patch-wise detection of the points of window frames on facades and roofs are undertaken using this kind of data. A density-based multi-scale filter is devised in the feature space of normal vectors to globally handle the matter of high volume of data and to detect edges. Color information is employed for the downsized data to remove the inner clutter of the building. Perceptual organization directs the approach via grouping and the Gestalt principles, to segment the filtered point cloud and to later detect window patches. The evaluation of the approach displays a completeness of 95% and 92%, respectively, as well as a correctness of 95% and 96%, respectively, for the detection of rectangular and partially curved window frames in two big heterogeneous cluttered datasets. Moreover, most intrusions and protrusions cannot mislead the window detection approach. Several doors with glass parts and a number of parallel parts of the scaffolding are mistaken as windows when using the large-scale object detection approach due to their similar patterns with window frames. Sensitivity analysis of the input parameters demonstrates that the filter functionality depends on the radius of density calculation in the feature space. Furthermore, successfully employing the Gestalt principles in the detection of window frames is influenced by the width determination of window partitioning.","[Malihi, Shirin; Zoej, Mohammad Javad Valadan; Mokhtarzade, Mehdi] KN Toosi Univ Technol, Fac Geodesy & Geomat Engn, Tehran 1966715433, Iran; [Malihi, Shirin] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Geodesy & Photogrammetry, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany; [Hahn, Michael] Univ Appl Sci, Fac Geomat Comp Sci & Math, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany",K.

We studied the role of depressive symptoms in the association between traffic noise and cognitive function. We studied the role of depressive symptoms in the association between traffic noise and cognitive function. Methods: During the first follow-up examination (2006-2008) of the German Heinz Nixdorf Recall study, cog-nitive function (five subtests and an additive global summary score, GCS) and depressive symptoms (CES-D score) were assessed in 2745 participants (aged 50-80, 49.8% women). Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was diagnosed according to the Petersen criteria in 380 participants. Long-term exposure to traffic noise was modeled as weighted 24-h mean (LDEN) and night-time mean (LNIGHT) at the facade of the baseline addresses, and was corrected for indoors (LDEN_IN and LNIGHT_IN). We developed multiple linear and logistic regression models adjusted for individual-level characteristics to investigate cross-sectionally the role of depressive symptoms in the association of traffic noise with cognitive function. Results: Overall, 8.6% participants had depressive symptoms. The median noise values were LDEN 52.1 dB(A) and LDEN_IN 34.7 dB(A). Associations were slightly stronger for cognitive subtests in those with severe depression (CES-D > 21), i.e., per 10 dB(A) LDEN and verbal fluency: beta =-0.04 [-0.11; 0.03] for CES-D <= 21 and beta =-0.09 [-0.24; -0.06] for CES-D > 21. Additional adjustment of the main model for CES-D did not change the association between noise and cognitive outcomes. Estimates using indoor noise exposure were generally stronger and more precise. Conclusions: Depressed people may be more susceptible to adverse effects of noise than non-depressed. Modeled estimates of indoor noise exposure is possibly a more appropriate measure of exposure.","[Tzivian, Lilian] Univ Latvia, Fac Med, Riga, Latvia; [Tzivian, Lilian; Soppa, Vanessa; Hennig, Frauke; Hoffmann, Barbara] Univ Hosp Dusseldorf, Fac Med, Ctr Hlth & Soc, Inst Occupat Social & Environm Med, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Winkler, Angela; Weimar, Christian; Jokisch, Martha] Univ Duisburg Essen, Univ Hosp Essen, Dept Neurol, Essen, Germany; [Moebus, Susanne] Univ Duisburg Essen, Ctr Urban Epidemiol, Inst Med Informat Biometry & Epidemiol, Essen, Germany",University of Latvia; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf Hospital; University of Duisburg Essen; University of Duisburg Essen,"Tzivian, L (corresponding author), Arbeitsgrp Umweltepidemiol, POB 101007, D-40001 Dusseldorf, Germany.",Lilian.Civjane@lu.lv,,,,,,,,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2020,230,,,,,,,,113570,10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113570,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113570,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Infectious Diseases",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000584390300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mental health problems have not received much attention in noise research. People perceive noise differently, which may affect the extent to which noise contributes to poor mental health at the individual level. This paper aims to assess the relationships between outdoor traffic noise and noise annoyance and the use of psychotropic medication. Methods: We conducted a survey to assess noise annoyance and psychotropic medication among residents of the Helsinki Capital Region of Finland. We also assessed the associations of annoyance and road-traffic noise with sleep disorders, anxiety and depression. Respondents were randomly sampled from the Finnish Population registry, and data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Outdoor traffic noise was modelled using the Nordic prediction model. Associations between annoyance and modelled facade-noise levels with mental health outcome indicators were assessed using a binary logistic regression while controlling for socioeconomic, lifestyle and exposure-related factors. Results: A total of 7321 respondents returned completed questionnaires. Among the study respondents, 15%, 7% and 7% used sleep medication, anxiolytic and antidepressant medications, respectively, in the year preceding the study. Noise annoyance was associated with anxiolytic drug use, OR = 1.41 (95% CI: 1.02-1.95), but not with sedative or antidepressant use. There was suggestive association between modelled noise at levels higher than 60 dB and anxiolytic or antidepressant use. In respondents whose bedroom windows faced the street, modelled noise was definitively associated with antidepressant use. Noise sensitivity did not modify the effect of noise but was associated with an increased use of psychotropic medication. Conclusion: We observed suggestive associations between high levels of road-traffic noise and psychotropic medication use. Noise sensitivity was associated with psychotropic medication use.","[Okokon, Enembe O.; Yli-Tuomi, Tarja; Turunen, Anu W.; Tiittanen, Pekka; Lanki, Timo] THL Natl Inst Hlth & Welf, Dept Hlth Protect, POB 95, FI-70701 Kuopio, Finland; [Juutilainen, Jukka] Univ Eastern Finland, Dept Environm Sci, Yliopistonranta 1, FI-70210 Kuopio, Finland; [Lanki, Timo] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Med, Yliopistonranta 1, FI-70210 Kuopio, Finland",Finland National Institute for Health & Welfare; University of Eastern Finland; University of Eastern Finland,"Okokon, EO (corresponding author), Univ Calabar, Fac Med, Dept Community Med, PMB 1115, Calabar, Nigeria.",enembe.okokon@thl.fi; tarja.yli-tuomi@thl.fi; anu.turunen@thl.fi; pekka.tiittanen@thl.fi; jukka.juutilainen@uef.fi; timo.lanki@thl.fi,,,,,,,,50,52,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2018,119,,,,,,287,294,,10.1016/j.envint.2018.06.034,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2018.06.034,,,,Environmental Sciences,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000444918100031,View Full Record in Web of Science

Studies in children mainly focussed on aircraft noise at school. Objectives: We aimed to investigate road traffic noise exposure at home and children's behavioural problems and sleeping problems. Methods: 872 10-year-old children from Munich from two German population-based, birth-cohort studies with data on modelled facade noise levels at home and behavioural problems were included. Noise was assessed by the day-evening-night noise indicator L-den and the night noise indicator L-night Behavioural problems were assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). A subgroup (N=287) had information on sleeping problems. Continuation ratio models (logistic regression models) adjusted for various covariates were applied to investigate the association between interquartile range increases in noise and SDQ scales (sleeping problems). Results: Noise measured by L-den at the most exposed facade of the building was related to more hyperactivity/inattention (continuation odds ratio (cOR)=1.28(95%-confidence interval(CI):1.03-1.58). Noise at the least exposed fa ade increased the relative odds for having borderline or abnormal values on the emotional symptoms scale, especially the relative odds to have abnormal values for a subject with at least borderline values (L-den:cOR=2.19(95% CI:1.32-3.64). Results for L-night were similar. Nocturnal noise at the least exposed facade was associated with any sleeping problems (odds ratio (OR)=1.79(95% CI=1.10-2.92)). Conclusions: Road traffic noise exposure at home may be related to increased hyperactivity and more emotional symptoms in children. Future longitudinal studies are required to explore noise exposure and behavioural problems in more detail, especially the role of sleep disturbances. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The facade is no longer a mere static element that offers a shelter for users. Instead, it is an active, restorative, and generative building system that maximizes the use of natural resources - light, heat, rain, and wind and engages occupants often as a visual stimulator. This paper explores an integrated facade system as a sustainable facade alternative to a contemporary curtainwall glazing system. The facade was designed for a multi-story office building in Charlotte NC with a south facing facade to maximize daylighting year around, reduce solar heat gain during cooling seasons, and increase solar heat gain during heating seasons. Comparative analysis was carried out to understand energy efficiency of an integrated facade system compared to a baseline building in accordance with ASHRAE 90.1. Advanced performance analysis was based on EnergyPlus and Radiance simulation. Results were compared to a baseline facade system to explore the impact of integrated facade systems on building energy consumption and daylighting efficiency.","[Kim, Kyoung-Hee; Torres, Alberto] Univ N Carolina, Dept Architecture, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Kim, KH (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Architecture, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",,,,,,,,,3,3,,,,,,,,,,,,2015,9,,,,,,125,128,,,,,,,Automation & Control Systems; Environmental Sciences,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000359721400031,View Full Record in Web of Science

The architectural system is based on the aggregation of space-bars which can be combined into housing units. The addition of two kinds of bar - one containing building services and structure, the other free of both - gives rise to a multiplicity of flexible housing layouts which are generated by the computer system. Housing units in turn are assembled in linear blocks. For each block there is an indefinite number of possible facades made of freely arranged panels and openings. Facade compositions are created in an interactive way, modifying some specific design parameters (orientation, isolation, illumination, cost). The program automatically generates the documents for building a block (drawings, preliminary bills of quantities). The existing prototype consists of a generative application to create housing units, blocks and facades and an environment to visualize blocks in three-dimensions in the Internet. In the future, both applications - for generating and for visualizing - will be integrated in a comprehensive platform, which will support communication and collaboration among all agents involved in the design and construction of housing blocks: architects, manufacturers, contractors and occupants.","[Madrazo, L.; Sicilia, A.; Pascual, D.] Univ Ramon Llull, ARC Arquitectura Engn Salle, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat Ramon Llull,"Madrazo, L (corresponding author), Univ Ramon Llull, ARC Arquitectura Engn Salle, Barcelona, Spain.",,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2006,,,,,,,651,+,,,,,,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Construction & Building Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000242968800082,View Full Record in Web of Science

Inter-organizational tensions have gained increasing attention in servitization literature recently, but their role in the emergent nature of servitization requires further research. By combining dialectic theory and the ARA framework from the Industrial Marketing and Purchasing (IMP) tradition, we develop a dialectic process model that identifies inter-organizational tensions as generative forces in servitization. We present a single case study about the implementation of a circular service proposition in the construction industry called Facade-as-a-Service. Our results reveal multiple tensions in a servitization context and how they emerged as a result of contradictory relationship structures in the existing and envisioned situations. We found that the tensions may be either anticipated as a result from direct clash between the status quo and an envisioned situation or unanticipated because they are indirectly as a result of interdepend ARA dimension. Our findings contribute to the existing literature by (i) extending knowledge on servitization tensions to a circular economy context, (ii) portraying servitization as a dialectic process that requires integration of competing interests, and (iii) opening the black box of inter-organizational tensions by adopting the ARA framework.","[Stegehuis, Xander; von Raesfeld, Ariane; Nieuwenhuis, Lambert] Univ Twente, Fac Behav Management & Social Sci BMS, Dept high tech Business & Entrepreneurship HBE, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Stegehuis, Xander] Fontys Univ Appl Sci, Fontys Int Business Sch, Tegelseweg 255 W1, NL-5912 Venlo, Netherlands; [Stegehuis, Xander] Univ Twente, POB 217, NL-7500 Enschede, Netherlands",University of Twente,"Stegehuis, X (corresponding author), Univ Twente, POB 217, NL-7500 Enschede, Netherlands.",x.stegehuis@utwente.nl,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2023,109,,,,,,204,220,,10.1016/j.indmarman.2023.01.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2023.01.004,,FEB 2023,,Business; Management,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000935339300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Since manual inspection is expensive, time consuming and risky, low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles or robots can be leveraged as a viable alternative for quick reconnaissance. Visual data captured by the sensors mounted on the robots can be analyzed, and the damages can be detected and classified autonomously. The present study proposes the use of deep learning-based approaches to this end. Region-based convolutional neural network (Faster RCNN) is exploited to detect four different damage types, namely, surface crack, spalling (which includes facade spalling and concrete spalling), and severe damage with exposed rebars and severely buckled rebars. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on manually annotated image data collected from reinforced concrete buildings damaged under several past earthquakes such as Nepal (2015), Taiwan (2016), Ecuador (2016), Erzincan (1992), Duzce (1999), Bingol (2003), Peru (2007), Wenchuan (2008), and Haiti (2010). Several experiments are presented in the paper to illustrate the capabilities, as well as the limitations, of the proposed approach for earthquake reconnaissance. It was observed that Inception-ResNet-v2 significantly outperforms the other networks considered in this study. The research outcome is a stepping stone forward to facilitate the autonomous assessment of buildings where this can be potentially useful for insurance companies, government agencies, and property owners.","[Mondal, Tarutal Ghosh; Jahanshahi, Mohammad R.; Wu, Rih-Teng] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Jahanshahi, Mohammad R.] Purdue Univ, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Wu, Zheng Yi] Bentley Syst Inc, Watertown, CT USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Jahanshahi, MR (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",jahansha@purdue.edu,,,,,,,,70,73,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2020,27,4,,,,,,,e2507,10.1002/stc.2507,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/stc.2507,,JAN 2020,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil; Instruments & Instrumentation",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000509964100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To address this problem, we proposed the Three-Channel Generative Adversarial Network. The algorithm decomposed color image into three color channels of RGB and utilized the single channel generators and dual discriminators in each color channel for adversarial training. The detailed discriminator adopted reversed PatchGAN which we proposed to be responsible for the image texture discrimination, and the structure discriminator adopted seven-layer convolutional structure to be responsible for the image structure discrimination.

Although Street View Images (SVIs) are applied in many studies, their usage in the generation of building usage maps is limited. Further, their application to Indian cities remains void. This research aims to fill the discussed gaps by employing geotagged SVIs through web scraping, Google Street View (GSV), and manual collection. Manually collected data from mobile phone and web-scraped images also cover the dense regions, which are generally not covered in GSV. Hence, it helps the generation of accurate maps. We first applied a pretrained Inception-ResNet-v2 model to detect the building instances from training images of various Indian cities. The extracted building instances were manually labeled as different usage class (residential, commercial, industrial, and others) to develop the classification training set. EfficientNet-B7, a Deep Learning (DL) model leveraged the facade features in the training process to predict the usage class of the building instances. The model achieved an accuracy of 81% on training and 77% on test sets. The predictions were attributed with building footprint using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to prepare building usage maps for various cities in India. Although the model faced challenges in predicting a lot of buildings with similar facade, we still found it to be robust in predicting the usage of buildings across various geography. The study can act as a decision-making tool in various smart applications that require high-resolution building-use data, which can help developing sustainable cities.","[Ramalingam, Surya Prasath] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res Bhopal, Elect & Comp Sci Engn, Bhopal, India; [Kumar, Vaibhav] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res Bhopal, Data Sci & Engn, Bhopal, India",Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (IISER) - Bhopal; Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (IISER) - Bhopal,"Kumar, V (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res Bhopal, Data Sci & Engn, Bhopal, India.",surya19@iiserb.ac.in; vaibhav@iiserb.ac.in,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 1,2023,235,,,,,,,,110215,10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110215,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110215,,APR 2023,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001030513900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The principal argument is the demonstration that the initial phases of the long and complex chain of design development can be shortened by the designer working in the computational environment of a typical laptop. The design domain is the Tower, and emphasis is on developing a generative system of design that offers simultaneous integration and differentiation throughout the subsystems of a concept for a tall building during the conceptual design phase. In this framework, the functional parameters of the tower system are incorporated with principles of biological models. Tower subsystems are grouped as the structural system, floor system, vertical circulation system, facade system, and environmental system. The paper focuses on the principles and structure of the Processing algorithm developed according to the rules of the key methodology, multi-parameter integration. Global constraints pertaining to each subsystem and the overall system are described, followed by the structure and operational logic of each subsystem's classes. Correlations which encompass several subsystems simultaneously are presented. Finally, evaluation of the output model is presented via progressive Finite Element Analysis (FEA) procedures in order to illustrate how each subsystem influences the structural behavior of the tower.","[Erdine, Elif] Architectural Assoc AA, Sch Architecture, London, England",,"Erdine, E (corresponding author), Architectural Assoc AA, Sch Architecture, London, England.",elif.erdine@aaschool.ac.uk,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2016,,,,,,,207,214,,,,,,,"Architecture; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Regional & Urban Planning; Urban Studies",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000582434600029,View Full Record in Web of Science

In response, the architectural design foresaw a continuous, 35,000 m(2) free-form glass roof to cover the four individual buildings of the mall ensemble. schlaich bergermann and partner consulting engineers were tasked with the structural design of the roof whose shape was inspired by the wings of a phoenix. To alleviate excessive in-plane stresses in the roof, a rigid triangulated grid was discarded in favour of a more elastic quadrangular frame system, requiring the generation of a quad-dominant topology on the free-form surface. The complex interplay between base buildings and roof structure required that all analysis be done on a combined model including roof, tree columns and sub-structure. Multi-resolution mesh modelling stood at the core of a generative work-flow which mathematically optimized for geometric and structural criteria in the same process.

Since scaffolds are commonly utilized to assist the construction and maintenance of building structures, professionals can estimate the overall progress and temporal objects of construction projects by assessing the status or arrangement of the scaffolds. Its thin, repeating and complex structures also make it a valuable dataset for testing related algorithms and approaches for the reconstruction of 3D construction site scene. To this end, we present a data driven workflow for the detection and reconstruction of scaffolding components, including tubes, toeboards, and decks, given a photogrammetric point cloud. Our workflow consists of two parts: one part concerns the strategy based on projection and methods of grouping and slicing planar surfaces for detecting and extracting points of scaffolds from the construction site. The other part relates to the point feature derivation using a novel 3D local feature descriptor LSSHOT, designed for extracting features in the classification of points. Specifically, our workflow is implemented by five major steps, including preprocessing of the point cloud, division of building facades, classification of points, geometric modeling and refinement of results. To evaluate our proposed descriptor, a series of simulated experiments using synthetic datasets is conducted via shape matching tests. A real application is also carried out to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our workflow using the photogrammetric point cloud of a construction site. Results of simulated experiments reveal that our proposed descriptor outperforms the original SHOT descriptor in the simulated test, especially when dealing with point clouds having a large percentage of noise. Regarding the real application of reconstructing scaffolds, points of scaffolds are successfully detected, extracted, and reconstructed. For a facade having enough points, over 70% of the scaffolding elements are reconstructed. For the classification of points using LSSHOT descriptor and a random forest classifier, the accuracy of results for the points of two major scaffolding elements reaches more than 70% in our test examples.","[Xu, Yusheng; Tuttas, Sebastian; Hoegner, Ludwig; Stilla, Uwe] Tech Univ Muenchen, Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Xu, YS (corresponding author), Tech Univ Muenchen, Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Arcisstr 21, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",yusheng.xu@tum.de,,,,,,,,38,41,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2018,85,,,,,,76,95,,10.1016/j.autcon.2017.09.014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2017.09.014,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000424071900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Presented in this paper is an alternative approach where true colour (RBG) point clouds are generated by automatically fusing a close-range optical (RGB) image acquired with an uncalibrated digital camera with the corresponding high-density 3D lidar point cloud collected with a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). The alignment of optical pixel colour values and lidar point cloud is obtained by estimating the position and orientation of the camera with respect to the lidar point cloud reference system. To perform this sensor co-registration, an automated corner feature extraction algorithm, followed by area-based image matching is applied between the optical data and the lidar intensity image to establish point correspondence. The matching process is solely based on point matches and does not use external control or calibration patterns. The 3D lidar points of the corresponding lidar intensity image corner points are then extracted from the point cloud. As these 3D lidar points correspond to the extracted optical image corner points, a bundle self-calibration adjustment with additional parameters is applied using the extended collinearity equations to estimate the interior and exterior orientation of the camera. The RANSAC robust estimator is used to reduce the influence of outliers in the estimation of the camera parameters. Having established the mathematical relationship between image space and lidar points a photo-realistic 3D model is generated. Through reverse mapping, each point in the lidar point cloud is assigned the RGB value of the image pixel upon which it is projected. Experiments are performed observing typical urban scenes, particularly building facades. The feasibility and potential of estimating the co-registration parameters using a TLS is evaluated in terms of accuracy of the results. The true calibration parameters, provided by the TLS manufacturer, are used in the validation of the registration parameters. The technique has reliably aligned a camera with the TLS geometry for the simultaneous generation of point based photo-realistic 3D models.","[Li-Chee-Ming, Julien; Armenakis, Costas] York Univ, Geomat Engn, GeoICT Lab, Dept Earth & Space Sci & Engn, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada",York University - Canada,"Li-Chee-Ming, J (corresponding author), York Univ, Geomat Engn, GeoICT Lab, Dept Earth & Space Sci & Engn, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada.",julienli@yorku.ca; armenc@yorku.ca,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2010,38,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,"Geography, Physical; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000358301700082,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this work, the behavior of carriage flame propagation, evolutionary mechanism and internal temperature distribution - caused by carriage fire in a 1/8 model tunnel were experimentally investigated. The effect of heat release rates (HRRs), longitudinal wind speeds and opening sizes on tunnel safety were comprehensively considered. The overall energy balance leads to the steady gas temperatures inside the carriage. The facade flame height and the flame horizontal extending distance are crucial for assessing the tunnel fire hazard. It is found that the height of facade flame decrease with relative lower longitudinal wind speeds to a threshold and then remains unchanged with increasing relatively strong longitudinal wind speeds increase. And, the horizontal extending distance of the facade flame increases with growing longitudinal wind speeds in the relatively lower range to a threshold and decreases with increasing longitudinal wind speeds increase in the relative strong range. Two new non-dimensional correlations based on model were proposed, taking into account all phase and longitudinal speeds for flame geometry features including, all fundamental physical factors included ventilation factor, inertia force, Froude number, thermal buoyancy and dimensionless HRR. Quantitative data and a basic introduction of the flame geometry at longitudinal speeds induced by carriage fires in a simulated tunnel, which is essentially different from other previously reported tunnel fires, are presented in this study. Furthermore, to perform fast calculation and contribute to fast operational tunnel management, machine learning methods, for example, BP neural network, were adopted to derive HRRs from the tunnel fire monitoring system by video data. The results of this paper can demonstrate the potential for tunnel fire safety engineering applications.","[He, Qing; Gu, Mingyan] Anhui Univ Technol, Sch Energy & Environm, Maanshan 243002, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Cao, Zhilei] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Automot & Transportat Engn, Hefei 230009, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Tang, Fei] Univ Sci & Technol China, State Key Lab Fire Sci, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tingting] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Lab 3SR, CNRS, Grenoble INP, F-38000 Grenoble, France","Anhui University of Technology; Hefei University of Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)","Tang, F (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, State Key Lab Fire Sci, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China.",ftang@ustc.edu.cn,,,,,,,,2,2,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2023,133,,,,,,,,104940,10.1016/j.tust.2022.104940,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tust.2022.104940,,JAN 2023,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000990561400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Drawing on the insights of recent advances in the social neurosciences, the authors demonstrate how theory and research rooted in the cold cognition era of human psychology has laid microfoundations for practices purporting to help address these challenges that are fundamentally unfit for purpose. Predicated on an outmoded conception of economic actors as affect-free information processors, devoid of emotion, scholars and practitioners alike are unwittingly perpetuating a (bounded) rationality facade. In so doing, they are undermining attempts to foster the requisite transformation of mindsets and behavior. To address these unintended consequences, new theory and research is required to shed light on the generative mechanisms through which firms might create the conditions to enable them to harness the cognitive and emotional capacities of individuals and groups, an essential step for overcoming the pitfalls of bias and inertia that so often inhibit adaptation to changing environments, thus slowing progress in the development and diffusion of innovations. To further this end, the present article advances a research agenda that places emotion management center stage, arguing that, to be truly dynamically capable, firms must learn to nurture self-regulation capabilities at all levels of the enterprise.

Similarly, while reverse engineering in some engineering disciplines is well-established, its implementation in architectural design remains under-represented. By combining the two domains, this paper develops a novel method that merges the power of shape grammars as a parsing tool in reverse engineering to decode the morphogenesis of visual compositions in architectural design. The merged power is demonstrated by decoding the formal language of a facade design of a case study, in which seemingly few simple rules can derive surprisingly complex compositions. The rules of the language can then be used to reconstruct parts of the case facade. Most shape grammars in the architectural literature are applied on formal historical precedents, but the subject of morphological analysis in this paper is contemporary and has a style that exhibits non-orthogonal configurations, which initially appear far from being standardized or subjected to regulatory tectonic rules. The facade derivation grammar is explained and re-synthesized in various computations to explore emergent articulations that display its predictive, synthetic, and generative powers in addition to typical analytic ones.

The city, configured as a space of transit with no identity or history, is defined as a continuous reconfiguration of itself. It has been turned into a mere facade, a showcase of multiple, rapidly-changing stimuli to seduce the citizen, now relegated to the role of consumer. From this position, subjects must construct alternatives that give them an active role in the eternal reformulation that characterizes the city as an event and not as a space. In these spaces for consumerism that postmodern cities have become, recreated as authentic shopping malls, citizens must find their own voices as transformers of society. In this paper we show the potential for creativity and renewal that these spaces of mass consumption possess, spaces that have become the new social terrain for encounter and enunciation. We will see how activist movements appropriate the language of advertising that shapes urban discourse, to subvert it and, through misrepresentation and parody, unmask the vacuum and moral paucity that mercantilism tries to hide. In this way, we highlight the creative potential in these counter-cultural practices that occupy public spaces and temples of consumption to express their criticism of a purpose-built consumer society. Culture jammers, using the guerrilla technique of counter-advertising, occupy the spaces of consumerist visibility monopolized by corporations, such as billboards or advertisements, to spread their message. They use detachment and humour, through collage and editing, in a visual and impactful way, giving new meanings that contradict the dominant discourse of consumption in the cities and construct a critique of the city from the centre of the spaces mediated by the market.",,,,ximglez@gmail.com,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2017,4,8,,,,,43,72,,10.6035/Kult-ur.2017.4.8.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.6035/Kult-ur.2017.4.8.1,,,,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000419758000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Use of sleep medication as an indicator of sleeping problems has rarely been explored in studies of the effects of traffic noise. Furthermore, using registry data on sleep medications provides an opportunity to study the effects of noise on sleep where attribution of sleep problems to noise is not possible. Methods: We used questionnaire data from the population-based study Health and Environment in Oslo (HELMILO) (2009-10) (n = 13,019). Individual data on sleep medications was obtained from the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD). Noise levels (L-night) were modeled for the most exposed facade of the building at each participant's home address. Logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders were used to analyze the association between traffic noise and sleep medication use both for one whole year and for the summer season. The results were reported as changes in the effect estimate per 5 decibel (dB) increase in noise level. Results: We observed no association between traffic noise and sleep medication use during one year [odds ratio (OR) = 1.00; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.96, 1.04]. For sleep medication use in the summer season, there was a positive, however non-significant association (OR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.10). Among individuals sleeping with the bedroom window open, the association increased slightly and was borderline statistically significant (OR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.12). Conclusions: We found no evidence of an association between traffic noise and sleep medication use during one year. However, for the summer season, there was some suggestive evidence of an association. These findings indicate that season may play a role in the association between traffic noise and sleep, possibly because indoor traffic noise levels are likely to be higher during summer due to more frequent window opening. More studies are, however, necessary in order to confirm this.","[Evandt, Jorunn; Oftedal, Bente; Krog, Norun Hjertager; Schwarze, Per E.; Aasvang, Gunn Marit] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Air Pollut & Noise, Div Infect Control & Environm Hlth, POB 4404 Nydalen, N-0403 Oslo, Norway; [Skurtveit, Svetlana; Skovlund, Eva] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Mental Disorders, Div Mental & Phys Hlth, POB 4404 Nydalen, N-0403 Oslo, Norway; [Skurtveit, Svetlana] Univ Oslo, Norwegian Ctr Addict Res SERAF, POB N-1039 Blindern, N-0315 Oslo, Norway; [Nafstad, Per] Univ Oslo, Fac Med, Dept Community Med & Global Hlth, POB N-1130 Blindern, N-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Nafstad, Per] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Noncommunicable Dis, Div Mental & Phys Hlth, POB 4404 Nydalen, N-0403 Oslo, Norway; [Skovlund, Eva] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Publ Hlth & Nursing, POB 8905, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Houthuijs, Danny] Dutch Natl Inst Publ Hlth & Environm RIVM, POB 1, NL-3720 BA Bilthoven, Netherlands",Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH); Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH); University of Oslo; University of Oslo; Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Netherlands National Institute for Public Health & the Environment,"Evandt, J (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Air Pollut & Noise, Div Infect Control & Environm Hlth, POB 4404 Nydalen, N-0403 Oslo, Norway.",jorunn.evandt@fhi.no,,,,,,,,7,7,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 23,2017,16,,,,,,,,110,10.1186/s12940-017-0330-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12940-017-0330-5,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000414018200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We conducted a nationwide register-based case-control study to assess the association between residential road traffic and railway noise exposure and risk of childhood cancers. Methods: We identified all cases of first cancers diagnosed in children aged 0-19 years in 1985-2013 from the Danish Cancer Registry (N = 3962) and sampled four individually matched (by sex and date of birth) controls per case (N = 14,790) using the Central Population Register. We estimated time-weighted exposure averages of residential road traffic and railway noise at the most (Lden max) and least (Lden min) exposed facades from birth to index-date (for additional analysis: in utero period) based on the individual address history for the respective time windows. We fitted conditional logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: ORs varied by noise estimate and cancer type, with generally wide CIs mostly including 1.00. We found a tendency of higher ORs with increasing railway and road traffic noise for Hodgkin lymphoma (ORs for railway and road Lden min were 1.63 (95% CI 1.00; 2.66) and 1.14 (95% CI 0.87; 1.48) per 10 dB), as well as a tendency of higher ORs with increasing railway noise for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. For embryonal CNS tumours and astrocytoma and other glioma we observed also some weak suggestions of a positive association. Analysing exposure to traffic noise in utero revealed similar patterns to those of the main analyses. Conclusions: This nationwide study with minimal risk of bias suggests no strong associations between traffic noise and risk of most childhood cancers.

However, compared to the manufacturing sector, labor productivity is low because of the high proportion of knowledge-based tasks and simple repetitive tasks. Therefore, knowledge-based task efficiency should be improved through the visual recognition of information by computers. A computer requires a large amount of training data, such as the ImageNet project, to recognize visual information. This paper proposes facade datasets that are efficiently constructed by quickly collecting facade data through road-view images generated from web portals and automatically labeled using deep learning as part of the construction of image datasets for visual recognition construction by a computer. Therefore, we attempted to automatically label facade images to quickly generate large-scale facade datasets with much less effort than the existing research methods. Simultaneously, we constructed datasets for a part of Dongseong-ro, Daegu Metropolitan City, and analyzed their utility and reliability. It was confirmed that the computer could extract significant facade information from the road-view images by recognizing the visual information of the facade image. In addition, we verified the characteristics of the building construction image datasets. This study suggests the possibility of securing quantitative and qualitative facade design knowledge by extracting facade design information from facades anywhere in the world. Previous studies mainly collected facade images through camera photography to construct databases, but in this study, a significant part of the database construction process was shortened through automation. In the case of facade automatic image labeling studies, it is the facade-based automatic 3D modeling which has been primarily studied, but it is difficult to find a study to extract data for facade design research.","[Gu, Hyeongmo; Choo, Seungyeon] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Architecture, 80 Daehak Ro, Daegu 41566, South Korea",Kyungpook National University,"Choo, S (corresponding author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Architecture, 80 Daehak Ro, Daegu 41566, South Korea.",ghm3186@knu.ac.kr; choo@knu.ac.kr,,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2022,12,15,,,,,,,7570,10.3390/app12157570,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app12157570,,,,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Applied",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000839349400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this scope, the development and application of image-based methods for evaluating and monitoring the state of conservation of buildings has shown significant growth, including support for maintenance plans. Recently, powerful algorithms have been applied to automatically evaluate the state of conservation of buildings using deep learning frameworks, which are utilised as a black-box approach. The large amount of data required for training, the difficulty in generalising, and the lack of parameters to assess the quality of the results often make it difficult for non-experts to evaluate them. For several applications and scenarios, simple and more intuitive image-based approaches can be applied to support building inspections. This paper presents the StainView, which is a fast and reliable method. The method is based on the classification of the mosaic image, computed from a systematic acquisition, and allows one to (i) map stains in facades; (ii) locate critical areas; (iii) identify materials; (iv) characterise colours; and (v) produce detailed and comprehensive maps of results. The method was validated in three identical buildings in Bairro de Alvalade, in Lisbon, Portugal, that present different levels of degradation. The comparison with visual inspection demonstrates that StainView enables the automatic location and mapping of critical areas with high efficiency, proving to be a useful tool for building inspection: differences were of approximately 5% for the facade with the worst and average state of conservation, however, the values deteriorate for the facade under good conditions, reaching the double of percentage. In terms of processing speed, StainView allows a facade mapping that is 8-12 times faster, and this difference tends to grow with the number of evaluated facades.","[Torres-Gonzales, Marta] Univ Seville, Dept Architectural Construct 2, Seville 41004, Spain; [Torres-Gonzales, Marta; Valenca, Jonatas; Silva, Ana; Mendes, Maria P.] ULisboa, IST ID, CERIS, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Santos, Bruno O.] ULisboa, IST, CERIS, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",University of Sevilla; Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico,"Valença, J (corresponding author), ULisboa, IST ID, CERIS, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",mtorres18@us.es; jonatas.valenca@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; oliveirasantos@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; ana.ferreira.silva@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; mpaulamendes@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 1,2023,15,11,,,,,,,2895,10.3390/rs15112895,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15112895,,,,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001004729000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This software is the result of intense R&D at Metria Digital after several years producing heritage true orthoimages, plans and full color 3D models in a commercial environment. Orthoware allows true measurements and produces high quality true orthoimages and full color 3D models starting out from conventional digital photographs. This is a progressive tool designed for non-specialist users, providing intuitive and quick methods to visually diagnose the quality of the results. The Church of San Ildefonso in Zamora was built over a previously existing temple whose Romanesque construction dates back to the 11th century, although it is nowadays hidden among extensions and remodelings carried out up until 18th century. With a length of more than 30 meters, the original floor plan of the Church consists on three naves and three apses, although only one nave is visible now, covered by groin vault, and one semicircular apse partially hidden by the current building. The south front maintains the greater part of its Romanesque origins, in spite of being hidden and higher than the present ground level. At the feet of the temple a tower rises, whose first stage is Romanesque but which has been altered by numerous Baroque elements. The objective of the photogrammetric reconstruction was the integral survey of the monument, including its four facades, interior faces and roofs for the production of some true-orthoimages, cross-sections, longitudinal-sections and ground plans at scale 1/50 with an accuracy of 10 mm for the drawings and a pixel size below 10 mm for the synthetic imagery. The usual photogrammetric workflow for producing true-orthoimages and digital 3D models in cultural heritage depends to a great extent on finding and matching homologous features amongst various images. This is a time-consuming, repetitive and blind recognition process requiring some spatial intuition and experience from the user. Orthoware makes use of automatic image analysis and computer vision techniques to improve this processing. Its innovative graphic user interface allows full interactivity and corrections or refinements to be performed at any time providing intuitive diagnostics from partial results. This flow involves very intensive calculations achieved through a software development specific for GPU (Graphic Processing Unit), using OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) and DirectX. Therefore, a combination of manual and automatic techniques makes up the ideal tool for a production environment. The workflow presented herein allow users to reduce orthoimage production time from months to just a few weeks.","[Perez, A.; Cachero, R.; Jorda, F.; Lopez, D.] Metria Digital SL, Llanera 33428, Asturias, Spain; [Navarro, S.; Lerma, J.

We report on mobile BC concentrations sampled on 10 biking sessions in the city of Curitiba (Brazil), during rush hours of weekdays, covering four routes and totaling 178 km. Moreover, simultaneous BC measurements were conducted within a street canyon (street and rooftop levels) and at a site located 13 km from the city center. We used two statistical approaches to model the BC concentrations: multiple linear regression (MLR) and a machine-learning technique called random forests (RF). A pool of 25 candidate variables was created, including pollution measurements, traffic characteristics, street geometry and meteorology. The aggregated mean BC concentration within 30-m buffers along the four routes was 7.09 mu g m(-3), with large spatial variability (5th and 95th percentiles of 1.75 and 16.83 mu g m(-3), respectively). On average, the concentrations at the street canyon facade (5 m height) were lower than the mobile data but higher than the urban background levels. The MLR model explained a low percentage of variance (24%), but was within the values found in the literature for on-road BC mobile data. RF explained a larger variance (54%) with the additional advantage of having lower requirements for the target and predictor variables. The most impactful predictor for both models was the traffic rate of heavy-duty vehicles. Thus, to reduce the BC exposure of cyclists and residents living close to busy streets, we emphasize the importance of renewing and/or retrofitting the diesel-powered fleet, particularly public buses with old vehicle technologies. Urban planners also use this valuable information to project bicycle lanes with greater separation from the circulation of heavy-duty diesel vehicles. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Our study examined the long-term associations of modeled and self-reported measures of air pollution and traffic noise on prevalent hypertension and BP. We analyzed cross-sectional data from 2552 participants aged 31-72 years from the KORA F4 (2006-2008) study conducted in the region of Augsburg, Germany. Land-use regression models were used to estimate residential long-term exposure to particulate matter <2.5 mu m (PM2.5), soot content of PM2.5 (PM(2.5)abs) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Road traffic noise levels at the facade of the dwellings were estimated for the participants' residences. Participants filled-in,a questionnaire on noise annoyance and heavy traffic passing their residence. Linear and logistic regression models adjusting for confounders were used to assess the association between exposure measures and hypertension and BP. An interquartile increase in annual mean PM2.5 (1 mu g/m(3)) was significantly associated with 15% higher prevalence of hypertension, without (95% CI: 2.5; 28.0%) and with (95% CI: 0.7; 30.8%) adjustment for traffic noise. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was associated with air pollutants and traffic noise with percent increases in mean of 0.7 (95% CI: 0.2; 1.2), 0.6 (95% CI: 0.1; 1.1) and 03 (95% CI: 0.0; 0.7) for an interquartile increase in PM2.5 (1 mu g/m(3)) and PM(2.5)abs (0.2 * 10(-5)/m), and 5 dB(A) increase in 24-hour road traffic noise, respectively. Associations of PM(2.5)abs and NO2 with hypertension or DBP were stronger in men and diabetic individuals. No clear associations were seen with systolic BP or noise annoyance. In conclusion, self-reported measures of air pollution or noise did not perform better than the objective measures. Our findings provide further evidence for a link between air pollution, noise and cardiovascular disease and indicate a stronger association for men and diabetic individuals. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The novel fabrication methods of AM allow for the production of highly differentiated building components with intricate internal and external geometries, aiming for reduced material use while integrating and enhancing building performance features including thermal insulation performance. This study focuses on integrating such thermal insulation performance by leveraging the individual features of three distinct AM processes: Selective Paste Intrusion (SPI), Selective Cement Activation (SCA), and Extrusion 3D Concrete Printing (E3DCP). Using a simulation-based parametric design approach, this research investigates 4,500 variations of monolithic AM facade elements derived from a generative hexagonal cell layout with differing wall widths, the three respective AM processes, different material compositions with and without lightweight aggregates, and three different insulation strategies, namely, air-filled cells, encapsulated lightweight aggregates, and additional insulation material within the cavities. Thermal performance feedback is realized via 2D heat flux simulations embedded into a parametric design workflow, and structural performance is considered in a simplified way via geometric and material-specific evaluation. The overall research goal is a multi-objective design optimization, particularly identifying facade configurations that achieve a U-value of less than 0.28 W/m2K and a theoretical compressive strength exceeding 2.70 MN per meter wall length. The results of this study detect 7% of all generated variations in line with these thermal and structural requirements, validating the feasibility of monolithic, thermally insulating AM wall elements. The presented workflow contributes to exploiting the potential of a new design of functionally hybridized AM components.","[Briels, David; Renz, Mauritz; Nouman, Ahmad Saleem; Auer, Thomas] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Engn & Design, Chair Bldg Technol & Climate Respons Design, Munich, Germany; [Strasser, Alexander; Hechtl, Maximilian] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Engn & Design, Chair Mat Sci & Testing, Munich, Germany; [Dahlenburg, Maximilian] Tech Univ Munich, Chair Mat Handling Mat Flow Logist, TUM Sch Engn & Design, D-85748 Munich, Germany; [Knychalla, Bruno; Sonnleitner, Patrick] Addit Tecton GmbH, Lupburg, Germany; [Herding, Friedrich] Tech Univ Carolo Wilhelmina Braunschweig, Inst Bldg Mat Concrete Construct & Fire Safety, Braunschweig, Germany; [Fleckenstein, Julia; Krakovska, Ema; Doerfler, Kathrin] Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Engn & Design, Professorship Digital Fabricat, Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich; Braunschweig University of Technology; Technical University of Munich,"Briels, D (corresponding author), Tech Univ Munich, TUM Sch Engn & Design, Chair Bldg Technol & Climate Respons Design, Munich, Germany.",david.briels@tum.de,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 17,2023,9,,,,,,,,1286933,10.3389/fbuil.2023.1286933,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fbuil.2023.1286933,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001096040400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Faculty of Arts at The University of Melbourne, Australia has re-focused its attention on the experience it provides undergraduate students on campus. The Arts West Redevelopment invested in the challenge to provide a rich, memorable and meaningful experience that could not be replicated online. Architectus in collaboration with ARM Architecture were engaged to deliver these aspirations in the form of a new building for the Bachelor of Arts. The challenge was to translate and enable this student experience through architecture. Three key areas were identified to influence the student experience; the campus planning, the formal learning spaces and the informal learning spaces. An exciting initiative was to create a purpose built building that released the University's significant artefact collections back into the curriculum and supported object-based learning. Object based learning provides a springboard for deep learning with improved retention and ability to recall, and importantly, a tactile experience that can't be mimicked digitally. This idea was embraced by the Arts West Redevelopment, not only in the teaching spaces but in the manifestation of the built form, inside and out. The entire building can be curated, the learning spaces support object based learning, a range of exhibition and display spaces are dispersed throughout the building while the facade embodies the concept with impressions of artefacts from the University's collection, alluding to the concept of object based learning which takes place within. This approach generates a remarkable atmosphere for the learning environment, both in terms of directed and informal learning. Students don't need to go to a museum or gallery, it's all around them at the end of the corridor or by the elevators.

Recent works show SISM provides semantic-aware auxiliary information for better style or structure manipulations. Providing structural assistance, segmentation maps have been broadly used as an intermediate interface to achieve better image manipulation. Mainstream solutions of image manipulation use Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) globally, locally or jointly. It is also applicable to SISM. However, the discriminator of global GAN is easier fooled, because the majority of its input is the same as the ground-truth, which is hard to fully mitigate the inconsistency between inpainted areas and the context. The inconsistency is more difficult for local GAN to address, due to the lack of context in its input. To mitigate the inconsistency, we propose a novel Multi-Expansion (MEx) loss. It is implemented by the adversarial loss on MEx areas. Each MEx area has the inpainted area as dominance and keeps knowledge of the scene context, so the consistency of the SISM results can be boosted. We propose an approximation of MEx loss, i.e., A-MEx loss, to further enhance the stability and usability. Besides performing well on SISM tasks, MEx loss also performs impressively on natural image inpainting.

Most extant studies of greenery systems focus on exterior applications such as green facades and roofs, which indirectly affect the indoor environment. Few studies have focused on quantifying the influence of indoor greenery systems on building energy consumption. The cooling effects of indoor greenery systems such as living walls are largely accounted for by the evapotranspiration (ET) process, in which water is transferred to the ambient environment through the evaporation from and transpira-tion of plants. Current building energy simulation software such as EnergyPlus does not have a module for modeling indoor greenery systems.In this study, an ET model was created using a machine learning algorithm-Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) based on experimental data. An indoor living wall model quantifying sensible and latent loads from the ET process was integrated with the energy simulation software-EnergyPlus through the Python plugin feature. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) medium-sized office building reference model was modified and used in this study to evaluate indoor living walls' impacts on cooling energy use. A parametric study on leaf to floor area ratios (LFAR), orientations, distances from windows, and climates was conducted to evaluate the influence of each factor on indoor living walls' performance. Cooling effects of indoor living walls were evaluated in three ASHRAE climates with high cooling demands. Observable cooling energy savings were obtained for the south, east, and west perimeter zones while savings for the north perimeter zone was negligible in all three climates. With the consideration of extra electricity use from direct expansion (DX) dehumidification devices for humidity control, the max-imum cooling electricity savings in Los Angeles, CA are 25.1 % when LFAR = 1.5 for the south perimeter zone, 14.4 % when LFAR = 0.5 for the east perimeter zone, 0.3 % when LFAR = 0.3 for the north perimeter zone, and 14.5 % when LFAR = 0.5 for the west perimeter zone on the design day.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, optimizing visual and thermal comfort simultaneously is a difficult topic due to mutual conflicts between them. This literature review article studies the facade, as a complex interface between inside of buildings and the outside that has a capability to function as a protective or regulatory element against severe fluctuations of external climate. Six interrelated subjects are studied including kinetic facade, biomimicry, building form as a microclimate modifier, energy efficiency, comfort condition, parametric design thinking. The literature review process answers following research questions: (1) what are the interdisciplinary subjects corresponding to kinetic facade design process for creating an innovative architectural process? (2) What is the most important factor in kinetic facade design with the aim to improve occupants' visual and thermal comfort simultaneously based on multidisciplinary investigation? Many research has been carried out about kinetic facade concepts strategies, principles, and criteria. However, interdisciplinary studies for proposing kinetic facade form is relatively rare. Also, adaptive daylight facade with daily solar geometry variation has been highly required. Therefore, generative-parametric and quick form finding method for responding to different climates would be a solution for providing more adaptability to dynamic daylight. This study aims to propose a kinetic facade design process which have capability to improve occupant visual & thermal comfort simultaneously by controlling on-site renewable energy resources consist of solar radiation and wind. Facade as an only interface between inside and outside of building, far from the literal and historical perceptions, is recognized by intrinsic functional attributes including complexity, heterogeneity and multidisciplinary. Moreover, the interrelated subjects impact facade form individually and aggregately regard to functional scenario that is changed the perception of kinetic facade from elegant and fashionable state to a functional and practical element.","[Hosseini, Seyed Morteza; Mohammadi, Masi] TU, Dept Built Environm, Smart Architectural Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Rosemann, Alexander] TU, Dept Built Environm, Bldg Lighting, Eindhoven, Netherlands; [Schroeder, Torsten; Lichtenberg, Jos] TU, Dept Built Environm, Eindhoven, Netherlands",Eindhoven University of Technology; Eindhoven University of Technology; Eindhoven University of Technology,"Hosseini, SM (corresponding author), TU, Dept Built Environm, Smart Architectural Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands.",s.m.hosseini@tue.nl,,,,,,,,78,83,,,,,,,,,,,APR 15,2019,153,,,,,,186,204,,10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.02.040,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.02.040,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000461457500017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data are coded as genes in the genetic algorithms. Optimal solutions can be achieved through the methods of crossing and mutation performed on these coded genes. Facade elements of the buildings with an architectural design in this study are independent of sustainability-related concerns, suggesting a great issue for the new buildings to be constructed in the traditional pattern. Accordingly, using the genetic algorithm method, proposals were presented for the new door and window typologies with genetic fitness for the architectural designing process of the buildings to be constructed in Surici Region, Diyarbakir, Turkey. Shape grammar, fractal and genetic algorithm, three generative designing systems, were used as the methods. Utilizing the genetic algorithm method, a field study was performed for the proposal of new door and window typologies with the fitness value. The field study was assessed through the plans and facade analyses regarding six Diyarbakir traditional houses with U plan type in Surici region of Diyarbakir. An identity card was created for the plan and facade data of the buildings and transferred to the table. Then, the door and window typologies of the exterior facade elements of each examined building were crossed within themselves with the GA method. As a result of the crossover, alternative joinery typologies with a total of 31 windows and 53 different door typologies with compatibility values were produced. Thus, the sustainability of the data of traditional joinery typologies for use in contemporary houses has been ensured. In conclusion, optimal alternative typologies were presented in regard to every chopping typology assessed with the genetic algorithm method. It is thought that this study should be a method that can be used in the production of exterior joinery typologies of contemporary houses to be built in many different cities of our country, especially in the historical texture. Thus, by using the GA method for the production of exterior joinery typologies of contemporary houses to be built in the region, different designers will be able to obtain various designs compatible with the traditional architectural texture while preserving their originality.","[Salik, Mizgin Gokce] Dicle Univ, Inst Sci & Technol, Diyarbakir, Turkiye; [Aykal, F.

J,"Leong, L; Leong, D; Leong, C",,,,"Leong, Leong; Leong, Dominic; Leong, Chris",,,3.1 PHILLIP LIM SEOUL FLAGSHIP. SOUTH COREA,EN BLANCO-REVISTA DE ARQUITECTURA,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"The flagship store designed by Leong Leong for 3.1 Phillip Lim is located in Cheongdam-Dong, Seoul's premiere fashion district. In a period of eight months, Leong Leong designed and oversaw the construction of the 550-square-meter store in an existing four-story building. The Flagship Typology - Sameness vs. Difference This project is a single store within 3.1 Phillip Lim's global roll-out campaign, which will include many international locations. Aware of the inevitable repetition that is necessary for such a commercial expansion, we thought of the typology of a flagship store as being characterized by the simultaneous need for sameness and difference. Typically, the consistent repetition of brand traits is necessary to reinforce an identity, while novelty can refresh the aura and desire for the brand. In this particular case the client, a relatively new fashion house launched in 2004, emphasized the need to establish a legible consistency in order to unify the different existing stores in New York, Los Angeles, and Tokyo. As a result, we questioned the inherent contradiction in the flagship typology. Can the need for sameness and difference become a generative friction rather than a trap? The Crop + The Stack + The Cut + notsign The Inkblot + The Liner + The Fade... We decided that an effective approach would consist of a playbook of organizational maneuvers that could respond to specific constraints (programmatic, site, economic, construction, schedule etc.) encountered in different store locations and contexts. It seemed logical to use the Los Angeles flagship as a kind of base diagram to which we could apply a combination of these plays in order to exploit the constraints in the Seoul site. The Crop + Stack + Cut: For example, the smaller footprint of the existing structure in Seoul is accommodated by literally cropping the continuous curving wall of the Los Angeles store into a smaller frame, creating four enclaves. We stacked the enclaves to fit within the two levels of retail space. Each enclave accommodates a different use-display, fitting rooms, storage, and stairs to the upper floor retail space. Since the existing space also had extremely low ceiling heights we extended two of the enclaves vertically to cut out double height spaces one of which became the new staircase to the upper floor. The main entrance to the store is also a type of enclave, cropped and recessed from the facade with a continuous glass storefront. The Inkblot: The existing perimeter walls are lined in mirror, multiplying the cropped curving wall into a field of enclaves extending infinitely in the reflection of the mirror. While the Los Angeles store uses mirror to double the enclosed spaces between the curving wall and the existing wall, the Seoul store uses mirror to expand a continuous visual field of space in which the cropped enclaves float. The Liner: We conceived of the facade and interior walls as being lined with evocative textures, a characteristic of Phillip Lim's design sensibility. It was during this part of the design process that we collaborated very closely with Phillip. The material liners create a narrative of atmospheres from one space to another, each offering an unexpected encounter with the clothing. After many explorations we decided the best solution was to capitalize on the need for consistency by deploying a series of moves or techniques that evolve the materials established in the brands other stores. Consequently, the pyramidal acoustic foam of the Los Angeles store evolved into a conical texture that erodes along the interior walls. We worked directly with a manufacturer to develop 5 unique foam panel types that could be organized into different erosion patterns. The wallpaper is the result of an ongoing collaboration with artist Wook Kim. Phillip had a strong desire to reference the local culture which inspired Wook to develop a pattern derived from ancient Korean ceramics. The herringbone floor pattern used in the Tokyo flagship is transplanted into the Seoul location and slowly transitions through a gradient of grey tones beginning at the entrance. The Fade: The 20-meter facade is also a material liner that wraps the existing building with a supple gradient of convex concrete panels. The eight different 600mm x 600mm panels types progressively flatten as they climb the facade. It seemed appropriate that the supple texture of the facade should fade into the often overcast and depthless grey sky of the city.",,,,,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2010,2,5,,,,,112,+,,,,,,,Architecture,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000441870000016,View Full Record in Web of Science
