However, the enormous time and costs that accompany optimization exploration are often beyond the reach of design practices. The application of machine learning in the construction field in recent years has offered potential solutions. Training predictive models through machine learning enables the rapid assessment of built environment performance and thus brings the optimization process closer to reality. In this paper, we mainly developed a process that integrates machine learning predictive model and multi-objective algorithms to achieve rapid evaluation and obtain optimal solutions. Using facade design as a case study, we demonstrate the design decision process with regard to the optimized solutions. The results showed that, through the proposed visual design decision process, designers can easily compare the performance and design appearance of different solutions and make informed decisions. In addition to saving 87% of time compared to the traditional simulation process, the integrated process also introduced the predictive model, which can achieve optimization exploration in one day. These results all demonstrate that the use of an integrated approach boasts considerable time advantages and potential feasibility in design practice.","[Lin, Chuan-Hsuan] Taiwan Design Res Inst, Serv Innovat Div, Taipei, Taiwan; [Tsay, Yaw-Shyan] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Architecture, Tainan, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University,"Tsay, YS (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Architecture, Tainan, Taiwan.",tsayys@mail.ncku.edu.tw,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,2023 AUG 11,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/13467581.2023.2244564,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13467581.2023.2244564,,AUG 2023,,Architecture; Construction & Building Technology,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001045379500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, model complexity can be significantly reduced through the incorporation of computer vision and image processing tools, aiming towards the estimation of structural 3D feature characteristics instead of their actual GPS specification. In this paper we present a strategy for constructing reduced-complexity 3D models, which combines stereo vision images and morphological processing methods. Initially, the building skeleton is extracted and modeled with the use of Hough transformation and Active Contours. Subsequently, the building's facade depth map is derived using the stereo camera layout, for the refinement of inner skeleton details, such as the protrusion of windows or doors. These image-driven features are fused with Georeferenced data in order to complete the full building's skeleton model.

Further, the point cloud is sliced along the three coordinate axes after adjusting the point-cloud attitude of the building to ensure that its orientation is consistent with the Y-coordinate axis. Then, the feature points on each slice arc extracted, and straight-line-segment clustering is applied to the extracted feature points based on the cylinder growth method. Finally, the straight-line-segment fitting of the feature points is performed using the 1-norm minimum residual algorithm, and the endpoints of the straight line segment arc adjusted and refined. Subsequently, we validate the proposed method by applying it to several sets of experimental data; the experimental results exhibit improved accuracy, precision, and recall. The extraction accuracy of the straight line segment is half the average point spacing in the point cloud. The precision of the proposed method for extracting straight line segments is increased by 2.4% on average than that of the plane segmentation and image detection methods, whereas the recall is increased by 18.1% on average.

BIM is a tool that allows maintaining a digital representation of all aspects of building information; therefore, it will enable the storage of almost any data related to a given structure, regarding its geometric and non-geometric aspects. Facade segmentation was first studied in the 1970s using hand-crafted expertise. Later, detection and segmentation studies emerged based on shapes of objects and parametric rules. With the developing technology, deep learning approaches in object detection studies have intensified. It is obvious that the desired analyses can be performed faster with deep learning approaches. However, deep learning methods require large training data. Algorithms that consider different situations and are suitable for real-world scenarios continue to be developed. The need in this direction continues in the literature. In this study, door and window detection was carried out with deep learning on an original data set.

The Fourier theoretical model which is traditionally used to model such enclosures is not capable of considering several factors that affect a prediction that is often incorrect. These results motivate us to try to obtain a better thermal model of the enclosure. For this reason, a connexionist model is provided capable of modelling the behaviour of the enclosure from actual observed temperature data. For the training of this model, several measurements have been obtained over the course of more than one year in a specific enclosure, distributing the readings among the different layers of it. In this work, the predictions of both the theoretical model and the connexionist model have been tested, contrasting them with the measurements obtained previously. It has been observed that the connexionist model substantially improves the theoretical predictions of the Fourier method, thus allowing better approximations to be made regarding the real energy consumption of the building and, in general, the prediction of the energy behaviour of the enclosure.","[Aznar, Fidel; Rizo, Ramon] Univ Alicante, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Alicante, Spain; [Echarri, Victor; Rizo, Carlos] Univ Alicante, Dept Architectural Construct, Alicante, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant,"Aznar, F (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Alicante, Spain.",fidel@dccia.ua.es,,,,,,,,11,11,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 21,2018,13,12,,,,,,,e0207616,10.1371/journal.pone.0207616,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0207616,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000454149400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although the artificial intelligence technology has made a breakthrough in image segmentation, it is nontrivial to directly apply standard deep learning approaches for building facade element detection. The main reason is that the existing semantic segmentation networks have a bad performance in predicting highly regularized shapes. This research develops a hieratical deep learning framework with a symmetric loss function to automatically detect building facade elements from images. The new framework contains two types of attention modules, namely, the spatial attention module, and the channel attention module. A new loss function is designed to integrate prior engineering knowledge, which can be used to force the detection of facade elements (e.g., windows, doors, concrete walls, and sunshades) to have a highly proportionate shape. The effectiveness of the developed approach is demonstrated in two public datasets. Experimental results indicate that the developed deep learning framework with a new loss function outperforms state-of-the-art models significantly, where the achieved a Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) on the Ecole Centrale Paris(ECP) dataset (81.9%) brings an improvement of 11.3% over Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and 4.0% over Deepfacade, respectively, and the achieved a Mean IoU on the ArtDeco dataset (85.6%) yields an improvement of 11.4% over FCN and 5.8% over Deepfacade, respectively. Moreover, the developed approach is more practical and effective to detect regularized facade elements, where the detection of the wall components has an IoU of 93.6% on the ECP dataset and 88.6% on the ArtDeco dataset, respectively. Overall, the contribution from the technical aspect is to develop a hieratical deep learning framework consisting of attention modules together with the newly designed loss function and the prior engineering knowledge. The contribution from the practical aspect is to realize the automatic and accurate detection for various building facade elements in complex environments, which can be potentially helpful for the infrastructure monitoring and maintenance operation.","[Zhang, Gaowei; Pan, Yue; Zhang, Limao] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Pan, Yue] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Shanghai Key Lab Digital Maintenance Bldg & Infra, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Zhang, LM (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, 50 Nanyang Ave, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",gwzhang@ntu.edu.sg; panyue001@sjtu.edu.cn; limao.zhang@ntu.edu.sg,,,,,,,,24,26,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2022,133,,,,,,,,104016,10.1016/j.autcon.2021.104016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2021.104016,,,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000787885200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Considering the accurate results of facade parsing, our method can be utilized for city-level building feature extraction, providing theoretical and practical references for urban building energy simulation, urban renewal, and building health examination.","[Lu, Yujie; Wei, Wei; Zhong, Tao; Nong, Yuanjun] Tongji Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yujie] Tongji Univ, Key Lab Performance Evolut & Control Engn Struct, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Li, Peixian; Shi, Xing] Tongji Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Li, Peixian; Shi, Xing] Minist Educ, Key Lab Ecol Energy Saving Study Dense Habitat, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Li, Peixian] Tongji Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, 1239 Si Ping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China",Tongji University; Tongji University; Tongji University; Tongji University,"Li, PX (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, 1239 Si Ping Rd, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",lipx@tongji.edu.cn,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 15,2023,295,,,,,,,,113275,10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113275,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.113275,,JUN 2023,,"Construction & Building Technology; Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001034671300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The approach was tested on 8768 UAV photographs shot at different angles and aimed at very different 611 buildings in the city of Vilnius (Wilno). The total accuracy was 98.41% in clear view settings, 88.11% in rain, and 82.95% when the picture was partially blocked by other objects and in the shadows. The algorithm's robustness was also tested on the Harward UAV dataset containing images of buildings taken from above (roofs) while our approach was trained using images taken at an angle (facade still visible).

Inspection practitioners have to manually examine the large amounts of high-resolution images collected by UAVs to identify anomalies or damages on building facades for reporting and repairs. The computer vision and deep learning technologies have emerged as promising solutions to automate the image-based inspection process. However, for the detection of facade cracks from UAV-captured images, existing deep learning solutions may not perform well due to the complicated background noises caused by different facade components and materials. Towards that end, this paper proposed a two-step deep learning method for the automated detection of facade cracks from UAV-captured images. In the first step, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model was designed and trained on 26,177 images to classify images in a patch-level size of 128 x 128 pixels into crack or non-crack. In the second step, a U-Net neural network model was trained on 2870 image sets to segment crack pixels within those patches classified as cracks. Experimental results show a high performance of 94% and 96% precision, 94% and 95% recall, and 94% and 96% F1-scores was achieved by the CNN model and the U-Net model respectively. The experimental results proved that the twostep method can improve the reliability and efficiency of detecting and differentiating facade cracks from complicated facade noises. The proposed method can also be extended to detect other types of facade anomalies (e.g., corrosion and joint failures), thus facilitating a comprehensive assessment of facade conditions for better decision-making for the maintenance of building facades during its service life.","[Chen, Kaiwen] Univ Alabama, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 401 7th Ave, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Reichard, Georg; Akanmu, Abiola] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Bldg Construct, 1365 Perry St, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Xu, Xin] Purdue Univ, Lyles Sch Civil Engn, 550 Stadium Mall Dr, W Lafayette, IN 47906 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Chen, KW (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 401 7th Ave, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",kaiwen.chen@ua.edu; reichard@vt.edu; xu942@purdue.edu; abiola@vt.edu,,,,,,,,37,37,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021,43,,,,,,,,102913,10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102913,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102913,,JUL 2021,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000701626700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

A camera-equipped UAV system can capture numerous high-resolution facade images for close-up visual inspections. However, in several cases, the multispectrum and spatiotemporal data collected by UAVs are not systematically documented and utilized, which obstructs the automation in the identification, localization, assessment, and tracking of facade anomalies. This paper develops an integrated, computational GIS-based information system to provide automated storage, retrieval, detection, assessment, and documentation of facade anomalies based on UAV-captured data. The developed system creates user-friendly access to diverse professional imagery analysis tools from external artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. A real-world case was studied to present the procedure and advances in the management and analysis of multisourced inspection data to automate UAV-based facade diagnosis. As a result, the proposed method facilitates the seamless fusion, processing, visualization, and documentation of multimodal inspection data, resulting in convenient analysis with discrepancies measured in decimeters for length, millimeters for width, and centimeters for geoposition.

Thus, nowadays, utilizing fa ade-cleaning robots seems inevitable. However, in case of navigating on cracked glass, these robots may cause hazardous situations. Accordingly, it seems necessary to equip them with crack-detection system to eventually avoid cracked area. In this study, benefitting from convolutional neural networks developed in TensorFlow (TM), a deep-learning-based crack detection approach is introduced for a novel modular facade-cleaning robot. For experimental purposes, the robot is equipped with an on-board camera and the live video is loaded using OpenCV. The vision-based training process is fulfilled by applying two different optimizers utilizing a sufficiently generalized data-set. Data augmentation techniques and also image pre-processing also apply as a part of process. Simulation and experimental results show that the system can hit the milestone on crack-detection with an accuracy around 90%. This is satisfying enough to replace human-conducted on-site inspections. In addition, a thorough comparison between the performance of optimizers is put forward: Adam optimizer shows higher precision, while Adagrad serves more satisfying recall factor, however, Adam optimizer with the lowest false negative rate and highest accuracy has a better performance.

Although it is 'performance-based', the final selection of a real design project still needs to consider the aesthetics of design choices. However, due to the overwhelming number of design choices generated by PGAD, it is difficult for designers to choose the most favourable one from them. Therefore, the current study tries to integrate the technology of sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) into the selecting stage of PGAD. Rather than navigating alternatives one from another and getting lost, designers can directly find the most aesthetically preferred one by inputting his/her hand-drawn design. A design project of fenestrating a multiple-floor office building is used to demonstrate this method and test three SBIR algorithms: Angular radial partitioning (ARP), Angular radial orientation partitioning (AROP), and Sketch-A-Net model (SAN). Test results show that AROP performs the best among these three algorithms. Its retrievals are most similar to inquiry images drawn by architects.

This work aims to optimize the safety analysis results of the underground building envelope and comprehensively improve the safety of the underground building. Long short-term memory (LSTM) can make long-term and short-term predictions, thus reducing the model's prediction error. Applying it to the deformation analysis, data prediction of the underground building envelope can improve the accuracy of the deformation prediction of the envelope. This work deeply discusses deep learning technology and the principle of the LSTM model. Based on the safety analysis concept of the underground building envelope, LSTM underground building envelope deformation's prediction model is established and comprehensively evaluated. The results show that in the prediction of horizontal displacement of foundation pit pile of diaphragm wall, the mean relative error (MRE) of the prediction results of the designed model range in 10%-18%, and the calculation time ranges 15-36 s. In the settlement displacement prediction, the model's MRE is within the range of 5%-7%, and the calculation time is within the range of 17-40 s. With the increase of training times, the prediction accuracy of the model increases, and the calculation time becomes relatively stable. Compared with other models, the relative error of prediction results is about 5.4% at the highest and 1.8% at the lowest. This work provides technical support for improving the safety prediction accuracy of the underground building envelope and provides some reference value for the comprehensive development of the underground building industry.","[Wang, Lijuan; Zhao, Qihua] Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab GeoHazard Prevent & Geoenvironm Prot, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China",Chengdu University of Technology,"Zhao, QH (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab GeoHazard Prevent & Geoenvironm Prot, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China.",wanglj1019@163.com; qhzhao310@163.com,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 14,2022,2022,,,,,,,,9489445,10.1155/2022/9489445,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/9489445,,,,Mathematical & Computational Biology; Neurosciences,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000864450000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Regular inspection is required for proper maintenance and automatic inspection offers a significant advantage over manual inspection as it is efficient and accurate. Many previous studies are focus on detecting damages in factory tiles for the quality control purposes, although there has not been much study on tile damages for historical temples. This paper proposed an image-based system to detect damages in tiles using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on a temple facade. The dataset was created by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and a digital camera from a historical temple in Bangkok, Thailand. In the proposed work, CNN was trained on various image patches sizes. The detection accuracy of the system was found to be 95% in the validation data and 91% on the testing data. The results of the proposed system were compared with a system using hand-crafted features, including 2D wavelet transforms with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

However, traditional methods are often time-consuming, expensive, and labourintensive. In recent years, deep learning techniques have been applied to detect cracks in masonry images, but these models often require large amounts of annotated data to achieve high accuracy, which can be difficult to obtain. In this article, we propose a deep learning approach for crack detection on brickwork masonry facades using transfer learning with limited annotated data. Our approach uses a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network model as a feature extractor, which is then optimised specifically for crack detection. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we created and curated a dataset of 700 brickwork masonry facade images, and used 500 images for training, 100 for validation, and the remaining 100 images for testing. Results showed that our approach is very effective in detecting cracks, achieving an accuracy and F1-score of up to 100% when following end-to-end training of the neural network, thus being a promising solution for building inspection and maintenance, particularly in situations where annotated data is limited. Moreover, the transfer learning approach can be easily adapted to different types of masonry facades, making it a versatile tool for building inspection and maintenance.","[Katsigiannis, Stamos] Univ Durham, Durham, England; [Seyedzadeh, Saleh] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland; [Agapiou, Andrew] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland; [Ramzan, Naeem] Univ West Scotland, Paisley, Scotland",Durham University; University of Edinburgh; University of Strathclyde; University of West Scotland,"Katsigiannis, S (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Durham, England.",stamos.katsigiannis@durham.ac.uk,,,,,,,,6,6,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 1,2023,76,,,,,,,,107105,10.1016/j.jobe.2023.107105,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2023.107105,,JUL 2023,,"Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001057475800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mathematically, data can be seen as functions describing an acoustic parameter varying with frequency. The aim of this study is twofold. On one hand, considering the laboratory as the grouping variable, it is important to assess the within-group and between-group variability in the measurements. On the other hand, in building acoustics, it is known that sound insulation is more variable at low frequencies (from 50 to 100Hz), compared with higher frequencies (up to 5000Hz), and therefore, a multilevel functional model is employed to decompose the functional variance both at the measurement level and at the group level. This decomposition also allows for the ranking of the laboratories on the basis of measurement variability and performance at low frequencies (relative high variability) and over the whole spectrum. The former ranking is obtained via the principal component scores and the latter via an original Bayesian extension of the functional depth.

The existing grammar-based approaches for facade parsing rely on strong prior knowledge but can obtain facade parts with better structure. Pixelwise-segmentation-based approaches achieve facade parsing with much less knowledge but the resulting structure of facade parts is normally incomplete. Both these approaches are restricted by their high reliance on the data set. Therefore, they cannot be applied for facade parsing with complex scenes. To address this issue, we built a large street-level data set by taking Mapillary images as the training data for more general scenes. At the same time, we propose a new pipeline based on convolutional neural network (CNN) that combines pixelwise segmentation and global object detection to achieve better results for facade parsing. Our pipeline can be applied to facade images after rectification and street-level facade images with complex scenes. The result of the ablation study demonstrates that the design of our pipeline is effective. We test our pipeline on the classic ECP2011 data set and our new large street-level data set. Our pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results for both the data sets: an accuracy of 98.2% and the mean average precision (mAP) of 98.8% on the ECP2011 data set as well as the mAP of 81.1% for facade parts parsing on our street-level data set.","[Kong, Gefei] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Fan, Hongchao] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Wuhan University; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Fan, HC (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",gefeikong@whu.edu.cn; hongchao.fan@ntnu.no,,,,,,,,10,10,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2021,59,12,,,,,10519,10531,,10.1109/TGRS.2020.3035878,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2020.3035878,,,,"Geochemistry & Geophysics; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000722170500054,View Full Record in Web of Science

It leads to further problems such as biological growth, delamination and efflorescence. Increased moisture also affects users' indoor comfort and more energy is needed for heating due to higher thermal conductivity. Therefore, it is useful to detect it before visible signs occur and this is possible with infrared thermography. A quasi-quantitative approach based on time-dependent infrared thermographic inspection and thermogram analysis by quantitative methods was tested in an adhered ceramic facade where rising damp had already been identified. Simple image subtraction (SIS), nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and principal component analysis (PCA) were the quantitative methods tested for the analysis of thermograms. Hammer-tapping control and surface moisture measurements were the auxiliary techniques used to assess the results. Comparative assessments showed that the quasi-quantitative approach using PCA has great potential to detect changes in moisture and also to eliminate false indications caused by unavoidable reflection and shading. The results obtained by SIS and NMF on the other hand, had limited performance in showing areas with high moisture content. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Among those techniques, reinforcement learning has been shown as particularly effective at reducing the dimensionality of some real problems and solving control problems by learning from experience. The use of thermal energy storage active systems in the building sector is identified as suitable option to reduce their energy demand for heating and cooling. However, these systems might be expensive and require appropriate control strategies in order to improve the performance of the building. In this paper a ventilated facade with PCM is controlled using a reinforcement learning algorithm. The ventilated facade uses mechanical ventilation during nighttime to solidify the PCM and releases this cold stored to the inner environment during the peak demand period. It is crucial to decide correctly the schedule of charge and discharge process of the PCM according to the weather and indoor conditions. An experimentally validated numerical model is used to test the performance of the control algorithm under different weather conditions. Important improvements on the energy savings due to the use of control strategies were found and supported by the data under the different tested climatic conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper aims to propose three different VFs and the authors define a novel machine learning-based approach to evaluate and predict their energy performance under different boundary conditions, without the need for expensive on-site experimentations Design/methodology/approach The approach is based on the use of machine learning algorithms for the evaluation of different VF configurations and allows for the prediction of the temperatures in the cavities and of the heat fluxes. The authors trained different regression algorithms and obtained low prediction errors, in particular for temperatures. The authors used such models to simulate the thermo-physical behavior of the VFs and determined the most energy-efficient design variant. Findings The authors found that regression trees allow for an accurate simulation of the thermal behavior of VFs. The authors also studied feature weights to determine the most relevant thermo-physical parameters. Finally, the authors determined the best design variant and the optimal air velocity in the cavity. Originality/value This study is unique in four main aspects: the thermo-dynamic analysis is performed under different thermal masses, positions of the cavity and geometries; the VFs are mated with a controlled ventilation system, used to parameterize the thermodynamic behavior under stepwise variations of the air inflow; temperatures and heat fluxes are predicted through machine learning models; the best configuration is determined through simulations, with no onerous in situ experimentations needed.","[Summa, Serena; Ulpiani, Giulia; Di Perna, Costanzo] Univ Politecn Marche, Fac Ingn, Dept Ind Engn & Math Sci, Ancona, Italy; [Mircoli, Alex; Potena, Domenico; Diamantini, Claudia] Univ Politecn Marche, Fac Ingn, Dept Informat Engn, Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University; Marche Polytechnic University,"Mircoli, A (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Marche, Fac Ingn, Dept Informat Engn, Ancona, Italy.",s.summa@pm.univpm.it; a.mircoli@univpm.it; d.potena@univpm.it; giuliaulpiani@gmail.com; c.diamantini@univpm.it; c.diperna@univpm.it,,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,2022 JUN 22,2022,,,,,,,,,,10.1108/CI-11-2021-0229,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/CI-11-2021-0229,,JUN 2022,,Construction & Building Technology,,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000813410600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Extracting facade features from three-dimensional (3D) point cloud data (3D PCD) is an efficient method for 3D building modeling. By combining the advantages of 3D PCD and two-dimensional optical images, this study describes the creation of a highly accurate building facade feature extraction method from 3D PCD with a focus on structural information. The new extraction method involves three major steps: image feature extraction, exploration of the mapping method between the image features and 3D PCD, and optimization of the initial 3D PCD facade features considering structural information. Results show that the new method can extract the 3D PCD facade features of buildings more accurately and continuously. The new method is validated using a case study. In addition, the effectiveness of the new method is demonstrated by comparing it with the range image-extraction method and the optical image-extraction method in the absence of structural information. The 3D PCD facade features extracted by the new method can be applied in many fields, such as 3D building modeling and building information modeling.

To automatically achieve visual evaluation of facade condition with high accuracy, current studies have applied various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to classify, localize, and segment the defects. However, the methods in previous research mainly focused on accuracy improvement rather than providing effective evaluations of defects according to the requirement of industry standards. Therefore, this study proposes a rule-based deep learning method to achieve evaluation-oriented facade defects detection, which can be used to provide effective evaluation areas containing the necessary information (e.g., type, location, quantity, and size of facade defects) for condition evaluation. First, annotation rules for classification, segmentation, and localization are designed to instruct the manual annotation work and automatically adjust the bounding boxes into effective evaluation areas. Then, a proposal weighting rule is developed to be combined with the deep learning model during the model training process to improve the accuracy and stability of the predictions. A rectification rule is further used to adjust the raw predictions into predictions with effective evaluation areas for facade defects. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrated that using the proposed method can successfully improve the performance of facade defects detection to meet the requirement of condition evaluation.

Deep learning is a promising approach to facade parsing, however, a straightforward solution by directly applying standard deep learning approaches cannot always yield the optimal results. This is primarily due to two reasons: 1) it is nontrivial to train existing semantic segmentation networks for facade parsing, e.g., Fully-Convolutional Neural Networks (FCN) which are usually weak at predicting fine-grained shapes (J. Long et al., 2015); and 2) building facades are man-made architectures with highly regularized shape priors, and the prior knowledge plays an important role in facade parsing, for which how to integrate the prior knowledge into deep neural networks remains an open problem. In this paper, we present a novel symmetric loss function that can be used in deep neural networks for end-to-end training. This novel loss is based on the assumption that most of windows and doors have a highly symmetric rectangle shape, and it penalizes all window predictions that are non-rectangles. This prior knowledge is smoothly integrated into the end-to-end training process. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our method has outperformed previous state-of-art methods significantly on five popular facade parsing datasets. Qualitative results have shown that our method effectively aids deep convolutional neural networks to predict more accurate, visually pleasing, and symmetric shapes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate symmetry constraint into end-to-end training in deep neural networks for facade parsing.","[Liu, Hantang; Xu, Yinghao; Zhang, Jialiang; Zhu, Jianke; Li, Yang] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jianke] Alibaba Zhejiang Univ Joint Res Inst Frontier Tec, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Hoi, Steven C.

To alleviate the problem, this study proposes an informativeness-guided active learning methodology to effectively select informative data to train a robust facade defects detector. A novel data annotation workflow is developed to ensure the high quality of labels. Then, an active learning-based model training strategy is adopted to enable the model to have both the abilities of generalization and discrimination on different defect features. Besides, an innovative informativeness assessment method is proposed by flexibly combining the degree of uncertainty and the degree of representativeness. Through the proposed method, the performance of facade defects detection can be further boosted with the same amount but more informative training data so that the cost-efficiency of human annotation work can be improved.","[Guo, Jingjing] Hunan Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qian; Su, Shu] Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct & Real Estate, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Yiting] Natl Univ Singapore, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Singapore, Singapore",Hunan University; Southeast University - China; National University of Singapore,"Wang, Q (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Construct & Real Estate, Nanjing 211189, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",qianwang@seu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,5,5,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2023,38,17,,,SI,,2408,2425,,10.1111/mice.12998,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mice.12998,,MAR 2023,,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Construction & Building Technology; Engineering, Civil; Transportation Science & Technology",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:000953629100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, this selection is highly dependent on early-stage design decisions, which are extremely challenging considering numerous design parameters with early-stage uncertainties. This paper aims to evaluate the appli-cability of deep learning networks in estimating the energy savings of different facade alternatives in the early-stage design of buildings. The energy performance of two competing facade systems (i.e., Ultra-High-Performance Fiber-Reinforced-Concrete and conventional panels) was estimated for different scenarios through building en-ergy simulations using EnergyPlusrm. Three deep learning networks were trained using the collected data from the simulation of fourteen buildings in fourteen different locations to estimate the heating, cooling, and total site energy savings. The accuracy of trained deep networks was compared with the accuracy of three common data-driven prediction models including, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, and Generalized Linear Regression. The results showed that the deep learning network trained to predict building total site energy savings had the highest accuracy among other models with a mean absolute error of 1.59 and a root mean square error of 3.48, followed by Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, and last Generalized Linear Regression. Similarly, deep networks trained to predict building cooling and heating energy savings had the lowest mean average error of 0.20 and 1.17, respectively, compared to other predictive models. It is expected the decision support system developed based on this methodology helps architects and designers to quantify the energy savings of different facade systems in early stages of design decisions.","[Abediniangerabi, B.; Shahandashti, M.] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Civil Engn, 416 S Yates St, Arlington, TX 76010 USA; [Makhmalbaf, A.] Univ Texas Arlington, Sch Architecture, 601 W Nedderman Dr, Arlington, TX 76010 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington; University of Texas System; University of Texas Arlington,"Abediniangerabi, B (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Civil Engn, 416 S Yates St, Arlington, TX 76010 USA.",bahram.abediniangerabi@uta.edu; atefe.makhmalbaf@uta.edu; mohsen@uta.edu,,,,,,,,9,9,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2021,5,,,,,,,,100077,10.1016/j.egyai.2021.100077,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egyai.2021.100077,,,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Energy & Fuels",,,,,,,,2024-01-16,WOS:001058083100010,View Full Record in Web of Science
